0,001-23131,ENG,NLD,ADMISSIBILITY,2003,ISMAIL EBRAHIM and SERHAN EBRAHIM v. THE NETHERLANDS,4,Inadmissible,,"The first applicant is a stateless person of Palestinian origin. He was born in Lebanon in 1981. The second applicant is his mother. She is a naturalised Dutch national of Palestinian origin and was born in Lebanon in 1961. The applicants, who are currently both residing in the Netherlands, are represented before the Court by Ms L. Mentink, a lawyer practising in Alkmaar. The respondent Government are represented by their Agents, Mr R.A.A. Böcker and Mrs J. Schukking, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. After the death of the first applicant’s father, who was active for the Palestine Liberation Organisation (“PLO”) in Lebanon, the second applicant married A.E. Ebrahim, the brother of her husband. Between June 1982 and November 1983, the latter was detained by the Israeli authorities because of his PLO activities. After his release, he was accused by the PLO of espionage for Israel. In 1986, A.E. Ebrahim and his family, consisting of the two applicants and a baby born in the meantime, left Lebanon for Germany, where they applied for asylum. After having stayed in Germany and subsequently Denmark, the family moved to the Netherlands where, on 24 May 1991, the second applicant (also on behalf of her children) and her husband applied for asylum or, alternatively, a residence permit on humanitarian grounds. On 16 March 1992, the State Secretary of Justice rejected these requests. The objection filed by the couple was rejected by the State Secretary on 16 September 1992. On 22 October 1992, the second applicant and her husband filed an appeal against the decision of 16 September 1992 with the Judicial Division (Afdeling Rechtspraak) of the Council of State. During their stay in the Netherlands, in the course of which three more children were born to the couple, serious tensions arose between the first applicant and his stepfather. In the latter’s opinion, the first applicant misbehaved by, inter alia, playing truant and having undesirable friends. He felt that he had no longer any authority over the first applicant. After the first applicant had broken into his school where he committed acts of vandalism, his stepfather decided to send him temporarily back to Lebanon. The second applicant thought that the first applicant would only go to Lebanon for a short period in order to become acquainted with his native country and culture. On 25 October 1994, without having been granted a re-entry visa (terugkeervisum) the first applicant travelled to Lebanon, where he moved in with his maternal grandmother in a refugee camp in SouthLebanon. The first applicant’s school and the Netherlands immigration authorities were informed of this fact. On 17 July 1995, pending the appeal proceedings before the Judicial Division, and in accordance with Dutch policy in asylum cases that have not been dealt with within a certain time span, the State Secretary informed the second applicant and her husband that the objections against their residence in the Netherlands had been withdrawn and that instructions had been issued to provide them and the second applicant’s minor children with a residence permit. The second applicant and her husband subsequently withdrew their appeal pending before the Judicial Division. On 1 September 1995, the second applicant reapplied for a residence permit on humanitarian grounds. This permit, also valid for her minor children living with her, was granted on the same day. On an unspecified date the second applicant and her husband filed a petition for naturalisation. In this petition, they further requested the conaturalisation (medenaturalisatie) of their four minor children. This request did not include the first applicant. By Royal Decree (Koninklijk Besluit) of 16 November 1996, the second applicant, her husband and their four children were granted Dutch citizenship. Wishing to return to the Netherlands, the first applicant requested the Netherlands authorities in Lebanon on 23 October 1997 for a temporary residence permit (machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf) on grounds of family reunification. On 23 July 1998, as his visa application remained undetermined, the first applicant filed an objection (bezwaar) with the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Minister van Buitenlandse Zaken) against the implied refusal (fictieve weigering) to grant him a temporary residence permit. On the same day, the first applicant further requested the President of the Hague Regional Court (arrondissementsrechtbank) to issue an interim measure (voorlopige voorziening) ordering the Minister of Foreign Affairs to issue a temporary residence permit or a laissez-passer allowing him to travel to the Netherlands together with the second applicant, who at that time was visiting him in Lebanon. On 14 August 1998 the Hague Regional Court set a deadline of 10 September 1998 for the Visa Department (Visadienst) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to determine the first applicant’s request for a visa. On 2 September 1998, in the context of the objection filed on 23 July 1998, the second applicant was heard by a commission of the Immigration and Naturalisation Department (Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst) concerning the first applicant’s request to enter the Netherlands. At that hearing, she declared inter alia that the first applicant had been sent to Lebanon after family tensions had arisen in the Netherlands because of the first applicant’s westernisation. It was thought desirable that he learn his language and culture and become acquainted with his family living in Lebanon. In an undated decision taken on or around 10 September 1997, the Minister of Foreign Affairs rejected the first applicant’s objection of 23 July 1998. On 17 September 1998, the first applicant filed an appeal against this decision with the Hague Regional Court. He further requested the President of the Hague Regional Court to issue an interim measure allowing him to travel to the Netherlands. On 6 November 1998, the President of the Hague Regional Court rejected the request for an interim measure. The President did not find it established that the first applicant’s situation was of such gravity that he should be allowed to enter the Netherlands as a matter of urgency. On 19 May 1999, following a hearing held on 18 February 1999, the Hague Regional Court declared the first applicant’s appeal of 17 September 1998 partly founded. Although the Regional Court agreed with the Minister of Foreign Affairs that, under the Netherlands immigration rules, the first applicant did not qualify for a temporary residence permit on grounds of family reunification, it held, as to the first applicant’s complaint under Article 8 of the Convention, that the preparation of the decision taken by the Minister of Foreign Affairs had been negligent and that this decision lacked sufficient reasoning. It was found that the Minister had failed to examine the question of the Netherlands’ positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention in a satisfactory manner, in that a number of important elements had not, or not sufficiently, been taken into account. Consequently, it quashed the impugned decision and ordered the Minister of Foreign Affairs to take a new decision. As none was taken within the prescribed statutory delay of six weeks, the first applicant filed an appeal on 5 July 1999 with the Hague Regional Court against this failure and requested accelerated proceedings (versnelde behandeling). In the course of the hearing held on 29 July 1999, the first applicant further requested the President of the Hague Regional Court to issue an interim measure allowing him to travel to the Netherlands. In its decision of 6 August 1999, the Hague Regional Court ordered the Minister of Foreign Affairs to determine the first applicant’s objection of 23 July 1998 within a period of ten weeks. It rejected the applicant’s other claims. On 29 October 1999, the first applicant again appealed to the Hague Regional Court as no fresh decision had been taken within the set time-limit and requested accelerated proceedings. In its decision of 30 November 1999, the Hague Regional Court noted that no new decision had been taken by the Minister of Foreign Affairs. It further noted that, on 24 November 1999, the second applicant had been heard by a commission of the Immigration and Naturalisation Department but apparently this hearing did not result in a determination of the first applicant’s objection. In the absence of a new decision on the merits of the objection, the Regional Court could only find that the Minister of Foreign Affairs had again failed to determine the objection timely. Consequently, it declared the first applicant’s appeal founded and ordered the Minister to determine the first applicant’s objection within two weeks. On 14 December 1999 the Minister of Foreign Affairs rejected the first applicant’s objection of 23 July 1998. The Minister recalled that, in its decision of 19 May 1999, the Hague Regional Court had accepted that the first applicant did not qualify for a residence permit on grounds of family reunification under the relevant domestic immigration rules. Insofar as the first applicant relied on Article 8 of the Convention, the Minister accepted that there was family life between the first applicant and his family living in the Netherlands, but did not find that there were such facts or circumstances which might give rise to a positive obligation on the Government to grant the first applicant a residence permit. On this point the Minister considered that the fact that the first applicant’s family had lived in the Netherlands since 1991 and held the Netherlands nationality did not in itself create such an obligation. Further noting that the choice to return the first applicant to Lebanon for a year had apparently been a conscious one, the Minister considered that the applicants should have realised that this choice entailed a risk that the first applicant would not be readmitted to the Netherlands. Having noted, inter alia, that the second applicant had visited the first applicant several times in Lebanon, the Minister did not find it established that there were any objective obstacles to the exercise of the applicants’ family life in Lebanon. As to the fact that the first applicant’s siblings held the Netherlands nationality and were attending school in the Netherlands, the Minister held that this was a subjective rather than an objective obstacle for the exercise of family life elsewhere. Finally, noting that the first applicant had attained the age of eighteen in the meantime, and that, as from a young age, he had taken independent decisions, including the termination of his schooling and his relocation within Lebanon, the Minister held that the first applicant could be regarded as being quite capable of maintaining himself, and concluded that the general interests of the Netherlands in pursuing a restrictive immigration policy outweighed the applicants’ interests. The first applicant filed an appeal with the Hague Regional Court, before which a hearing was held on 17 March 2000. In its decision of 7 April 2000, the Hague Regional Court rejected the appeal. It accepted the finding of the Minister that it had not been established that, on the basis of his personal circumstances, the applicant could not be expected to remain in Lebanon and should be admitted to the Netherlands on humanitarian grounds. It did not find it established that the first applicant was in fact wanted by El Fatah and for that reason was continuously forced into hiding, as he had alleged. Noting that the first applicant was housed and financially supported by his uncle, that other members of his family are living in Lebanon and that the second applicant could continue to provide him with support, the Regional Court concluded that the finding of the Minister could not be regarded as unjust. As to the argument raised under Article 8 of the Convention, the Regional Court concluded that, in the light of its findings as to the first applicant’s personal situation, the interests of the Netherlands Government in pursuing a restrictive immigration policy outweighed the applicants’ interests in exercising their family life in the Netherlands. The Regional Court did not find it established that there were any objective obstacles preventing the applicants from enjoying their family life in Lebanon. It noted on this point that the asylum request of the first applicant’s stepfather had been rejected but that he had subsequently obtained a residence permit because of a special policy allowing asylum seekers to remain when asylum proceedings had lasted more than three years. The Regional Court further rejected the argument that the siblings’ integration into Dutch society should be regarded as an objective obstacle to the whole family’s return to Lebanon. On 6 January 2001, the first applicant travelled on a false passport via Senegal to Belgium intending to continue to the Netherlands. He was arrested in Belgium and placed in aliens’ detention. He subsequently applied for asylum in Belgium. On 9 January 2001, via his lawyer in the Netherlands, the first applicant requested the Netherlands authorities to take over his asylum request from Belgium. On 11 January 2001, the first applicant’s lawyer further filed a new request for a temporary residence permit for the first applicant. After the Belgian authorities had rejected the first applicant’s request for asylum, he was expelled to Senegal on 16 February 2001. Upon his arrival in Senegal, the first applicant was detained as he held no documents allowing him to stay in Senegal. The Senegalese authorities allowed him to telephone the second applicant. On 19 February 2001, the first applicant – via his lawyer in the Netherlands – informed the Netherlands authorities of his situation, requesting them to intervene and allow him to travel to the Netherlands. After the second applicant had sent money to Senegal, the first applicant was released on 9 March 2001 and was told to leave Senegal within three months. On 16 May 2001, the first applicant travelled to the Netherlands, where he has resided since. On 14 June 2001, the Minister of Foreign Affairs rejected the first applicant’s application of 11 January 2001 for a temporary residence permit, finding that such a permit cannot be granted when the person concerned has already entered the Netherlands. The first applicant’s objection to this decision, in which he only argued that he should be regarded as exempted from the obligation to have a temporary residence permit and did not raise any arguments concerning the reasons for the rejection of 14 June 2001, was dismissed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs on 31 July 2001. Although an appeal against this decision could be filed with the Regional Court, it does not appear that the first applicant availed himself of this possibility. In the meantime, on 28 February 2001, the first applicant’s lawyer requested the Hague Regional Court to declare that, on the basis of the Royal Decree of 16 November 1986 and at that time being a minor son of the second applicant, the first applicant is a Dutch national. On 1 August 2001, following a hearing held on 4 July 2001, the Hague Regional Court rejected the first applicant’s request. It noted that the first applicant had already left for Lebanon when his mother, stepfather and their children were granted a Dutch residence permit and that, subsequently, the second applicant and her husband were granted Dutch nationality, it being stipulated that Dutch nationality was withheld from minor children who did not hold a Dutch residence permit. On this point the Regional Court also noted that the request for naturalisation, resulting in the Royal Decree of 16 November 1996, had not included the first applicant. It therefore concluded that no misunderstanding could have arisen about the first applicant’s exclusion from the naturalisation decision. It further rejected as unestablished the first applicant’s argument that, in departing for Lebanon, he had not intended to alter his principal place of residence (hoofdverblijf) in the Netherlands or to sever his family tie. On this point the Regional Court noted that, at the time of naturalisation, the first applicant had already resided for two years in Lebanon with different relatives. In addition, the Regional Court took into account the reasons for his return to Lebanon given by the second applicant before the commission of the Immigration and Naturalisation Department, namely family tensions caused by his westernisation, and the need for him to learn the language and the culture, and to become acquainted with his family in Lebanon. The admission, residence and expulsion of aliens were regulated at the material time by the Aliens Act 1994 (Vreemdelingenwet), the Regulation on Aliens (Voorschrift Vreemdelingen) and the Aliens Act 1994 Implementation Guidelines (Vreemdelingencirculaire; “the Guidelines”), being directives drawn up and published by the Ministry of Justice. On 1 April 2001, the Aliens Act 2000 entered into force – replacing the 1994 Aliens Act – along with a new Regulation on Aliens and new Guidelines. The Netherlands authorities pursue a restrictive immigration policy in view of the high population density in the Netherlands and the problems to which this gives rise. In general and under the legal rules in force until 1 April 2001, aliens are only granted admission for residence purposes if: (a) the Netherlands are obliged under international law to do so; (b) this serves the “essential interests of the Netherlands”, e.g. economic or cultural interests; and (c) there are “cogent reasons of a humanitarian nature” (Chapter A4/5.3 of the Guidelines). No right to admission to the Netherlands can be derived from the fact that a non-Dutch national is living there without a residence permit. An alien wishing to enter and stay in the Netherlands for more than three months must have a temporary residence permit. An application for such a permit can be made to the Netherlands authorities in the alien’s country of origin. The resident in the Netherlands with whom an alien seeking admission is planning to stay, can also apply to the chief of the local police for an official opinion. An application for a temporary residence permit is determined on the basis of the same requirements as a residence permit. These requirements differ depending on the grounds on which an alien seeks admission and residence. The policy for admission for family reunification purposes was at the relevant time laid down in Chapter B1/5 of the Aliens Circular. This provides, insofar as relevant, that a residence permit for the purposes of family reunification may be granted in respect of minor children of a Dutch national when, inter alia, the children factually belong to his/her family and the family ties with the parent already existed abroad and have been maintained. Family ties are considered to have been severed by the longterm integration of the child into another family when the parents no longer exercise parental authority and no longer provide for the costs of the upbringing and care of the child. Aliens who are allowed to remain in the Netherlands pending a decision on their residence status may under certain conditions, with the consent of the Dutch authorities, return to their countries of origin for short periods. If they meet the requirements, being at least compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature, such as a serious illness or the death of close relatives, they may be granted a re-entry visa, which affirms the right of the holder to return to the Netherlands. No re-entry visas for a temporary return to their country of origin are granted to asylum seekers.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
1,001-75287,ENG,TUR,ADMISSIBILITY,2006,DURGUN AND OTHERS v. TURKEY,4,Inadmissible,,"The applicants, whose names appear in the appendix, are Turkish nationals. They are represented before the Court by Mr Ali Cemal Zülfikar, a lawyer practising in Elazığ. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows. Until 1994 the applicants lived in Bilekli village, in the Hozat district in Tunceli province, where they own property. It is to be noted that the title deeds to the property that Polat Ferhat, Mevlit Ceviz and Kemal Durgun used in Bilekli bear their mothers’ and fathers’ names. In October 1994 security forces forcibly evacuated Bilekli on account of disturbances in the region. They also destroyed the applicants’ property. The applicants and their families then moved to Elazığ where they currently live. On 20 October 1994 Kemal Durgun’s father filed a petition with the District Governor’s office in Hozat and requested redress for the damage he suffered and sought permission to return to their village. On 1 December 1994 Kemal Durgun’s father filed a petition with the Prime Minister’s office requesting provided with government aid and asking the authorities to expropriate his property. On 14 January 1995 Kazım Demirkılıç filed a petition with the Ministry of Public Works and Settlement requesting permission to return to his village and compensation for the damage he suffered. On 20 January 1995 the Governor’s office in Tunceli sent a letter to Kemal Durgun’s father and informed him about the aid supplied by the District Governor’s office in Hozat. They further noted that there was no legal ground for expropriation of property. On 11 November 2000 Kemal Durgun filed a petition with the District Governor’s office in Hozat requesting redress for the damage he suffered and seeking permission to return to his village. On 11 and 20 November 2000 the applicants lodged petitions with the Public Prosecutor’s office in Hozat complaining about the burning down of their house by security forces. On 13 February 2001 the Public Prosecutor sent a letter to the applicants stating that he had issued a decision of non-jurisdiction and had sent the case- files to the Administrative Council in Hozat. The Public Prosecutor further noted that the latter authority had decided not to conduct an investigation into the applicants’ allegations as the perpetrators of the alleged acts could not be identified. Until 1994 the applicants lived in Halitpınar village, in the Ovacık district in Tunceli province, where they own property. It is to be noted that Kamber and Veli Çelik did not submit any certificate to the Court attesting their ownership of the property in Halitpınar. In October 1994 security forces forcibly evacuated Halitpınar on account of disturbances in the region. They also destroyed the applicants’ property. The applicants and their families then moved to Elazığ where they currently live. On an unspecified date the applicants lodged petitions with the Public Prosecutor’s office in Ovacık complaining about the burning down of their house by security forces. On 9 December 1994 the Ovacık Public Prosecutor’s office issued a decision of non-jurisdiction and sent the case-files to the Administrative Council in Ovacık. On 25 October 1995 the Administrative Council in Ovacık decided not to conduct an investigation into the applicants’ allegations as the perpetrators of the alleged acts could not be identified. On 16 August 1995 and on 2 February 1999 the headman of Halitpınar village, Süleyman Toprak, filed petitions with the President’s office, the General Headquarters of Refah Partisi (Welfare Party), the Prime Minister’s office, the Presidency of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, the Ministry of Public Works and Settlement, the Governor’s office in Tunceli, the District Governor’s office in Ovacık and the Emergency Regional Governor’s office on behalf of the residents of Halitpınar village and asked the aforementioned authorities to allow the residents to return to their village. He further requested compensation for the damage they suffered. He received no response. On 18 February 1998 Cafer Toprak filed a petition with the District Governor’s office in Ovacık requesting permission to return to his village. On 25 June 1998 the District Governor’s office in Ovacık sent the following reply to him: “... The struggle against terrorism in our region has been continuing intensively and positive result is being achieved. Our government has been working on the solutions to the problems you have mentioned in your petition and you will be informed by the District Governor’s office when it is possible to return to the villages...” On an unspecified date Cemal Toprak, Kamber Çelik and Veli Çelik filed petitions with the District Governor’s office in Ovacık requesting permission to return to their village. On 10 June 2000 the District Governor’s office in Ovacık sent the following reply to the applicants: “Your petition containing a request of permission to return to your village has been received by the District Governor’s office and will be considered under the ‘Return to Village and Rehabilitation Project’.” Until 1994 the applicants lived in Karaoğlan village, in the Ovacık district in Tunceli province, where they own property. It is to be noted that Ms. Güllü Gülerdoğan did not submit any certificate to the Court attesting her ownership of the property in Karaoğlan. In October 1994 security forces forcibly evacuated Karaoğlan on account of disturbances in the region. They also destroyed the applicants’ property. The applicants and their families then moved to Elazığ where they currently live. On 27 July 1995 and on 4 August 1995 Hıdır Gülerdoğan filed petitions with the District Agriculture Directorate (İlçe Tarım Müdürlüğü) in Ovacık and the Governor’s office in Tunceli and requested loan for livestock. On 11 September 1995 Güllü Gülerdoğan and Hıdır Gülerdoğan filed petitions with the Governor’s office in Tunceli requesting permission to return to their village. On 11 October 1995 the Governor’s office in Tunceli sent the following reply to the applicants: “Your petition containing a request of permission to return to your village has been considered by the District Governor’s office. You will be informed about the developments by the headman (muhtar) of the village.” On 18 February 1998 Hıdır Gülerdoğan filed a petition with the District Governor’s office in Ovacık requesting permission to return to his village. On the same day the District Governor’s office in Ovacık sent the following reply to the applicant: “... The struggle against terrorism in our region has been continuing intensively and positive result is being achieved. Our government has been working on the solutions to the problems you have mentioned in your petition and you will be informed by the District Governor’s office when it is possible to return to the villages...” On 16 August 1998 and on 2 February 1999 the headman of Karaoğlan village, Düzgün Yıldız, filed petitions with the President’s office, the General Headquarters of Refah Partisi (Welfare Party), the Prime Minister’s office, the Presidency of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, the Ministry of Public Works and Settlement, the Governor’s office in Tunceli, the District Governor’s office in Ovacık and the Emergency Regional Governor’s office on behalf of the residents of Karaoğlan and requested the aforementioned authorities to allow the residents to return to their village. He further requested compensation for the damage they suffered. He received no response. On an unspecified date the applicants filed petitions with District Governor’s office in Ovacık requesting permission to return to their village. On 10 June 2000 the District Governor’s office in Ovacık sent the following reply to the applicants: “Your petition containing a request of permission to return to your village has been received by the District Governor’s office and will be considered under the ‘Return to Village and Rehabilitation Project’.” On 20 August 2004 the representative of the applicants informed the Court that Mr Fedi Gülerdoğan had died and his heirs, Fındık Gülerdoğan, Cafer Gülerdoğan, Sevgi Canpolat and Serdar Güneş wish to pursue the application. The investigation carried out by the authorities indicated that the applicants had left their villages of their own will. The security forces had not forced the applicants to leave their village. The official records indicated that there was no obstacle preventing villagers from returning to their homes and possessions in their villages. Persons who had left their villages as a result of terrorism had already started returning and regaining their activities in their villages. On 14 July 2004 the Law on Compensation for Losses resulting from Terrorism and the Fight against Terrorism was passed by the Grand National Assembly and entered into force on 27 July 2004 (“Compensation Law”). That Law provided for a sufficient remedy capable of redressing the Convention grievances of persons who were denied access to their possessions in their villages. In that connection Damage Assessment and Compensation Commissions were set up in seventy-six provinces. Persons who had suffered damage as a result of terrorism or of measures taken by the authorities to combat terrorism could lodge an application with the relevant compensation commission claiming compensation. The number of persons applying to these commissions had already attained approximately 170,000. A further 800 persons, whose applications were pending before the Court, had also applied to the compensation commissions. Many villagers had already been awarded compensation for the damage they had sustained. A description of the relevant domestic law can be found in the Court’s decision of İçyer v. Turkey (no. 18888/02, §§ 44-54, 12 January 2006) and in its judgment of Doğan and Others v. Turkey (nos. 88038811/02, 8813/02 and 8815-8819/02, §§ 31-35, ECHR 2004-VI).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
2,001-22045,ENG,NLD,ADMISSIBILITY,2001,MENSAH v. THE NETHERLANDS,4,Inadmissible,Elisabeth Palm;Gaukur Jörundsson,"The applicant, George Kenneth Mensah, has both Dutch and Ghanaian nationality. He was born in 1954 and is living in Almere, the Netherlands. He is represented before the Court by Mr Kooij, a lawyer practising in Almere. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. In 1978 the applicant, when living in Ghana, entered into a traditional/religious marriage (i.e. a non-civil marriage) with a Ghanaian woman. Out of this relationship twins were born in 1982, George Kobina and Georgia Araba Mensah. In 1983 the relationship between the applicant and his partner ended. The applicant submits that their mother did not wish to continue to take care of the twins and that he has since taken care of them. He has not been in contact with the mother since and her whereabouts are unknown to him. In March 1984 the applicant entered the Netherlands for the first time. On 4 May 1984 he was expelled from the Netherlands on the grounds that he was staying in the country illegally. On 14 June 1984 the applicant married Ms. J. Lijesen, a Dutch national. The wedding took place in Ghana and the couple lived there for a short period together with the applicant’s children. At the end of 1984 the applicant’s wife decided to move back to the Netherlands. The applicant followed her and entered the Netherlands on 11 January 1985. On 29 March 1985 the applicant obtained a residence permit to stay with his wife. One child was born to the applicant and Ms. Lijesen. Their marriage lasted until 29 March 1989, when it was dissolved. On 4 May 1990 the applicant obtained Dutch nationality. On 15 August 1990 the applicant married Ms. M. Owusu Sekyere. They were divorced on 30 July 1992. In 1995 the applicant entered into a traditional/religious marriage with Ms. Juliana Owiredua of Ghanaian nationality. Ms. Owiredua has since obtained Dutch nationality. On 17 July 1996 they concluded a cohabitation contract (samenlevingscontract). The applicant submits that his two former partners, Ms. Lijesen and Ms. Sekyere, did not want to have his children brought into the family and refused to take care of their upbringing, whereas Ms. Owiredua had no objection to taking care of them and loves them as if they were her own. The applicant further submits that he was unable to let the children come to the Netherlands earlier as this would have been refused on the grounds of his lack of sufficient means of subsistence as required under Dutch law. Upon the applicant’s departure from Ghana, his two children were initially, and temporarily, housed with a friend of the applicant’s in Ghana. After three years the children could no longer be taken care of by that friend and had to move to the house of another friend - a Mr Aboya - who, after having started a family of his own, no longer wanted to take care of the applicant’s children. The applicant submits that his friends merely provided temporary accommodation for his children and were not effectively exercising parental authority over them. He took parental decisions, and he also paid all his children’s living expenses. From 1988 he has been visiting his children three times per year, being employed by an airline company enabling him to travel at cheaper rates. The relation between the applicant and Mr Aboya worsened when he discovered that in the latter’s family, funds, which he had sent for his children, were used for other purposes. Thus, money intended to cover school fees was allegedly appropriated by Mr Aboya, as a result of which the children were unable to go to school in Ghana. In September 1995 the then thirteen year old twins travelled to the Netherlands on a tourist visa. They have been living with the applicant and Ms. Owiredua ever since. On 7 November 1995 the applicant applied for a residence permit (vergunning tot verblijf) for his children. On 31 October 1996 the State Secretary of Justice (Staatssecretaris van Justitie) rejected the request, finding that the conditions under which family reunification could be allowed had not been fulfilled. Thus, no evidence had been produced either as to the existence of family ties prior to the applicant’s residence in the Netherlands, or of contacts between the father and the children having been maintained. Neither was there any evidence that the applicant had supported his children financially. The State Secretary noted, inter alia, that the applicant, since his arrival in the Netherlands, had formed a new family twice. The situation in Ghana was not found to be of such a nature that the children could not return there, and neither had they become integrated in the Netherlands to such an extent that a return to Ghana could not be expected of them. On 16 January 1997 the applicant filed an objection (bezwaar) with the State Secretary against his decision. On 3 June 1997 the State Secretary rejected the objection, finding that the family ties between father and children had been broken in view of the fact that the applicant’s leaving the twins in the care of friends for ten years could not be considered to have been a temporary measure. The State Secretary concluded that even if the situation in Ghana was less favourable for the children than the one in the Netherlands, they should nevertheless be presumed capable of fending for themselves without requiring intensive supervision and, if necessary, with financial support from the Netherlands. On 30 June 1997 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Hague Regional Court (Arrondissementsrechtbank) sitting in Zwolle. He argued that the interpretation given by the domestic authorities of “family” was not in line with Article 8 of the Convention and the case-law of the Court. He further emphasised the difficulties which his children would face if returned to Ghana, with no adequate accommodation or care, whereas he was capable of taking care of them in the Netherlands. On 1 July 1997 a person responsible for the children at school reported that they were suffering emotional problems as a result of their experiences in Ghana and that especially Georgina would benefit from a social rehabilitation programme. On 22 July 1997 a hearing took place before the Regional Court during which it appeared that, contrary to earlier statements by the applicant, the children had stayed with their grandmother in Ghana for seven or eight years and that regular contacts also existed between the children and their mother. The Regional Court rejected the applicant’s appeal on 24 July 1998. It held that the burden of proof as to the continued existence of family ties lay with the applicant and that he had failed to produce sufficient evidence of such family ties. In addition, no evidence confirming the applicant’s financial support or the actual exercise of parental authority over the children had been produced. In respect of Article 8 of the Convention the Regional Court found that the current level of family life between the applicant and his children had been created at a time when the children were not allowed to be in the Netherlands. Therefore, the decision to refuse them residence was not aimed at depriving them of a previously granted right to family reunification. The Regional Court concluded that Article 8 of the Convention did not impose a positive obligation on the State to respect an alien’s choice to exercise his family life in the Netherlands. It was further held that sufficient facilities for the care of the children existed in Ghana. On 21 January 1999 temporary guardianship (voorlopige voogdij) of the applicant’s daughter Georgia was attributed by the Juvenile Court Judge (kinderrechter) of Lelystad to a child care organisation, on the grounds that the applicant was not properly fulfilling his parental duties. On 11 February 1999 the Child Care and Protection Board (Raad voor de Kinderbescherming) filed a request with the District Court (kantongerecht) of Lelystad for the applicant nevertheless to be awarded parental authority (ouderlijk gezag) over his daughter Georgia. On 18 February 1999 the District Court judge awarded the applicant parental authority over his daughter Georgia and issued a supervision order (ondertoezichtstelling) whereby a child care organisation was charged with providing the applicant and his daughter the necessary support. On 14 April 2000 the Aliens Department (Vreemdelingendienst) of Almere confiscated the children’s passports and ordered them to leave the country. Article 1 of the Aliens Law (Vreemdelingenwet) provides that a provisional residence visa (machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf) is required for an alien who wishes remain in the Netherlands for a period of more than three months. The policy for admission for family reunification purposes is laid down in Chapter B1/5 of the Aliens Circular (Vreemdelingencirculaire). This provides, insofar as relevant, that a residence permit for the purposes of family reunification may be granted to a parent of Dutch nationality with minor children, when the children factually belong to his/her family and family ties with one of the parents already existed abroad. Family ties are considered to have definitely ceased to exist in case of long-term integration of the child into another family while the parent(s) no longer exercise parental authority and no longer provide for the cost of upbringing and care of the child.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
3,001-58099,ENG,FRA,CHAMBER,1997,CASE OF EL BOUJAÏDI v. FRANCE,3,No violation of Art. 8,C. Russo;John Freeland,"7. Mr El Boujaïdi was born in Morocco in 1967 and is a Moroccan national. In 1974 he went with his mother, his three sisters and his brother to join his father in France. He has been living in Morocco since enforcement on 26 August 1993 of an order for his permanent exclusion from French territory. 8. The applicant went to school in France, where he also worked for several years. 9. In October 1986 a network of traffickers in heroin imported from the Netherlands was discovered in the Saint-Etienne area (Loire). Eight people, including the applicant, were committed for trial at Saint-Etienne Criminal Court charged with consumption of and trafficking in prohibited drugs. 10. On 24 March 1988 the Saint-Etienne Criminal Court sentenced Mr El Boujaïdi to three years’ imprisonment, to run concurrently with another sentence of thirty months’ imprisonment imposed by the Annecy Criminal Court on 25 September 1987 for dealing in heroin, and ordered him to pay customs fines. Applying Article L. 630-1 of the Public Health Code, it further imposed permanent exclusion orders on Mr El Boujaïdi and three of his co-defendants and a three-year exclusion order on a fourth. 11. On appeal by the prosecution, the Lyons Court of Appeal, in a judgment of 12 January 1989, increased the applicant’s sentence to six years’ imprisonment, with ineligibility for parole during the first two-thirds thereof, and confirmed the permanent exclusion order. The reasons for the judgment were set out as follows: “In April 1987, in the course of an inquiry aimed at breaking up a heroin-trafficking network operating in Saint-Etienne, the police arrested [the applicant], who had been named as a supplier by various users. During questioning by the police and the investigating judge El Boujaïdi admitted that he had been using heroin for several months and that he injected himself with up to 1.5 grams per day. According to his statements, he obtained his supplies from [K., A. and I.], who obtained their supplies in Holland. Again according to his own statements, El Boujaïdi had been peddling heroin since November 1986 to finance his own consumption. He even stated at one interview that each time he bought five grams he sold on three. The various users named in the charge as buyers from El Boujaïdi confirmed during the course of the inquiry that they had obtained varying quantities of heroin from him throughout the relevant period, namely from September 1986 to April 1987. According to the statements made by a number of these buyers, El Boujaïdi was known to drug addicts in Saint-Etienne as a supplier and users could meet him in a bar in Place Chavanelle, where the transactions took place. El Boujaïdi was found guilty of selling heroin to [B.] in a judgment of Annecy [Criminal] Court of 25 September 1987, which has become final. There is therefore no need to rule on that offence. As regards the remaining charges, and in view of the extreme seriousness of the accused’s conduct, the Court upholds the guilty verdict referred from the court below and sentences El Boujaïdi to six years’ imprisonment, to run concurrently with the thirty-month sentence passed on 25 September 1987 by Annecy Criminal Court ... The Court orders [the applicant’s] permanent exclusion from French territory. ...” 12. On 25 March 1991, pleading his family ties in France, Mr El Boujaïdi lodged a first application to have the order permanently excluding him from French territory rescinded. In a judgment of 14 May 1991 the Lyons Court of Appeal declared the application inadmissible on the ground that under Article L. 630-1 of the Public Health Code an alien permanently excluded from French territory could not apply for the relevant order to be rescinded. 13. Following an attempted robbery, the applicant – who had been released on 19 June 1991 – was arrested and, on 6 December 1992, detained under a committal warrant. For this offence and the fact that he had stayed in France in spite of the permanent exclusion order imposed on him, on 11 January 1993 the Saint-Etienne Criminal Court sentenced him to one year’s imprisonment. 14. On 25 May 1992 Mr El Boujaïdi again applied to have the exclusion order rescinded. He submitted that the length of time he had been living in France brought him into a category of convicted aliens on whom, under Article L. 630-1 of the Public Health Code, in its new version as amended by the Law of 31 December 1991, an exclusion order could not be imposed. He also argued that on account of his family ties in France the exclusion order was in breach of Article 8 of the Convention. 15. The Lyons Court of Appeal refused this application on 26 November 1992 in a judgment containing the following reasons: “The applicant has submitted not only that the order permanently excluding him from French territory should be rescinded in the light of Article 8 of the ... Convention ... but also that, as a matter of fact, he has lived in France since 1974 and the whole of his family lives here too. … While Mr El Boujaïdi’s application has become admissible since the repeal by the Law of 31 December 1991 ... of the last paragraph of Article L. 630-1 of the Public Health Code, the applicant cannot rely on the substantive provisions of that legislation, which are not retrospectively applicable to convictions that became final, as in this case, before its entry into force. His application must accordingly be dealt with on its own merits, on the basis of Article 55-1 of the Criminal Code. Mr El Boujaïdi has adduced no new evidence since his conviction on 12 January 1989. He cannot argue, as an unmarried man, that his exclusion from French territory is an intolerable interference in his family life within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention ... The offences he has committed, after two previous convictions for drug offences, make his presence on French territory dangerous for public health and public order. ...” 16. On 15 March 1994 the Court of Cassation (Criminal Division) dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant on 30 November 1992 against the judgment of the Lyons Court of Appeal on the ground that Mr El Boujaïdi’s statement of the grounds of appeal did not bear his signature. 17. On 22 July 1993 Mr El Boujaïdi made a third application requesting the Lyons Court of Appeal to rescind the exclusion order. In support of his appeal – which was based on Article 8 of the Convention – he pleaded changes in his personal circumstances, namely the fact that he was living with a Frenchwoman, Mrs M., and was the father of the child she had given birth to on 6 July. On 5 August 1993 the social worker at the prison where Mr El Boujaïdi was detained wrote to his lawyer in the following terms: “... In reply to your letter of 28 July 1993 concerning the steps taken over the last few months regarding recognition of the child of Mr El Boujaïdi, currently imprisoned, for whose social welfare I am responsible, I can inform you that, at the request of Mr El Boujaïdi and [Mrs M.], his cohabitant: 1. In April I prepared the paperwork for a prenatal recognition of paternity and sent the file both to the town hall of La Talandière and to Assistant State Counsel so that the appropriate submissions could be made to the Registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths. 2. As this application had been unsuccessful and the child had been born – on 6 July 1993 – I compiled a new recognition of paternity file and sent it on 3 August 1993 to State Counsel’s Office at the Saint-Etienne tribunal de grande instance. ...” 18. On 26 August 1993 the exclusion order was enforced. 19. On 20 October 1993, at the French Consulate in Fez, Mr El Boujaïdi recognised paternity of Mrs M.’s child. 20. In a judgment of 16 December 1993 the Lyons Court of Appeal refused the application to have the exclusion order rescinded on the following grounds: “Mr El Boujaïdi’s lawyer has produced various documents showing that Mr El Boujaïdi met Mrs M. in January 1992, that is at a date when he should not have been present on French territory. Their child was born on 6 July 1993. The circumstances he relies on therefore came into being at a time when he was permanently excluded from French territory. The exclusion order was imposed to penalise a dangerous trade in heroin. That being so, the Court does not see fit to allow the present application. ...” 21. Relying mainly on Article 8 of the Convention and the European Court’s case-law, the applicant appealed on points of law. In a judgment of 25 October 1994 the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal on the following grounds: “The judgment under appeal shows that Abderrahim El Boujaïdi, who is a Moroccan national, was sentenced, inter alia, to be permanently excluded from French territory for an offence against the dangerous drugs legislation, in a judgment of the Lyons Court of Appeal of 12 January 1989, which has become final, and that by an application dated 22 July 1993 he sought to have that exclusion order rescinded. In rejecting that application the Court of Appeal observed that the family circumstances on which the appellant relies came into being while he was permanently excluded from French territory. It further stated that the purpose of the additional penalty imposed on the appellant was to ‘penalise a dangerous trade in heroin’. … Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms does not prohibit limitations prescribed by law on the right to respect for family life, provided that they are necessary for, among other things, public safety, the prevention of disorder and the protection of health. That is the position in the present case. It follows that the appeal, which amounts to a challenge to the courts’ discretionary power under Article 55-1 of the Criminal Code, then in force, cannot be allowed. ...” 22. Article L. 630-1 of the Public Health Code formerly provided: “... the courts ... may order an alien convicted of an offence under Article L. 627 to be permanently excluded from French territory. Exclusion from French territory shall of itself entail the deportation of the convicted person at the end of his sentence. ... Where a person, on conviction, is permanently excluded from French territory, he may not request the benefit of the provisions of Article 55-1 of the Criminal Code.” Law no. 91-1383 of 31 December 1991 replaced the last three paragraphs by the following provisions: “However, exclusion from French territory shall not be imposed on: ... 2. a convicted alien who is the father or mother of a French child resident in France, provided that he or she is vested with or shares parental authority over that child or provides for its needs; ... Nor shall exclusion from French territory be imposed on a convicted alien who can prove either: 1. that he has been normally resident in France since reaching the age of 10 at the most or for more than fifteen years; or 2. that he has been lawfully resident in France for more than ten years. ... Exclusion from French territory shall of itself entail the convicted person’s deportation, where necessary after the end of his prison sentence.” Article L. 630-1 was repealed by Law no. 92-1336 of 16 December 1992. 23. Article 55-1 of the Criminal Code provides: “... Any person who has incurred a disability ... as an automatic consequence of a criminal conviction or on whom such disability ... has been imposed by the convicting court in its judgment ... may request the court which convicted him ... to rescind the disability ..., in whole or in part, or vary its duration. …”",[],[],[],['8'],[],[],0
4,001-23239,ENG,NLD,ADMISSIBILITY,2003,RIEKWEL v. THE NETHERLANDS,4,Inadmissible,,"The applicant, Mr Marco Riekwel, is a Netherlands national, who was born in 1967. He is represented before the Court by Mr L.C.M. Jurgens, a lawyer based in Amsterdam who is not licensed to practise but who provides legal assistance and representation in cases where representation by a licensed advocate is not prescribed by law. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. On 5 July 1997, at approximately 2.50 a.m., police officers in Rotterdam stopped a motor car and tested the driver’s breath for alcohol. There being an indication that the driver’s breath might contain more alcohol than was legally permitted, the driver was taken to a police station and subjected to a more precise test. This second test showed that the driver’s breath did in fact contain a higher proportion of alcohol than permitted. The driver of the car gave the applicant’s name. It appears from a police report dated after the event, which the applicant claims is inaccurate, that the driver of the car was found in possession of a driving licence or other identity document in the applicant’s name containing a photographic likeness of the bearer. The driver of the car confessed that he had drunk five glasses of beer. He was sent home with a summons to appear on 25 September 1997 before the single-judge chamber (politierechter) of the Regional Court (arrondissementsrechtbank) of Rotterdam on a drink-driving charge. No one appeared at the hearing on 25 September 1997. The applicant was convicted in absentia of drink-driving and sentenced to pay a fine of 800 Netherlands guilders (NLG). The applicant claims, essentially, that he only became aware of this when he was ordered to pay the fine. He lodged an appeal against his conviction and sentence to the Court of Appeal (gerechtshof) of The Hague. The Court of Appeal decided to consider the drink-driving charge and the charge of driving an uninsured car – of which the applicant had been convicted in separate proceedings – jointly. It held hearings on 24 November 1997, 25 August and 30 November 1998 and 1 March 1999, at which, for various reasons not relevant to the case before the Court, the applicant did not appear. At the hearing on 1 March 1999, the applicant’s counsel, who was present, pleaded on the applicant’s behalf that another person had in fact been arrested on 5 July 1997 and had fraudulently pretended to be the applicant. He invited the police officers who had been called as witnesses to identify the applicant from a series of photographs. The Court of Appeal, however, decided that the applicant’s presence in person was required to establish whether or not he was in fact the person arrested on 5 July 1997. A further hearing was set for 26 April 1999. By letter of 22 April 1999, the applicant informed the Court of Appeal that he did not intend to appear. He stated that he did not trust the police officers to make a correct identification except in a confrontation attended by sufficient safeguards, for example a line-up of himself and other persons of similar appearance. The hearing proceeded on 26 April 1999 in the applicant’s absence. The Court of Appeal gave judgment on 10 May 1999. It declared the applicant’s appeal against the first-instance conviction of drink-driving inadmissible as out of time. Its reasoning included the following: “In the opinion of the Court of Appeal the original summons for the [single-judge chamber of the Regional Court’s] hearing of 25 September 1997 was handed to the suspect in person on 5 July 1997. It follows that the suspect should have appealed within fourteen days of the judgment delivered on 25 September 1997. However, the suspect only appealed on 19 November 1997, so the suspect’s appeal must be declared inadmissible. The Court of Appeal is of the opinion that it was the suspect to whom the original summons was handed. The Court of Appeal considers it relevant in this respect that, as appears from the official report drawn up on 8 November 1997 by Police Sergeant S. ..., the suspect identified himself to the reporting police officers by means of an identity document bearing a photographic likeness resembling the suspect. The Court of Appeal has further found that the [record of] the interrogation of the suspect, to which he was subjected on 5 July 1997, is signed with a signature which in the Court of Appeal’s opinion is sufficiently similar to the one which the suspect has placed on the letter of authority with which he has authorised the lodging of an appeal ... and on the receipt belonging to the official record of the delivery of the notification of the pronouncement of the judgment of the single-judge chamber of the Regional Court ...” The applicant’s counsel, a licensed advocate, lodged an appeal on points of law (cassatie) to the Supreme Court (Hoge Raad) on the applicant’s behalf. Mr Jurgens took over the applicant’s representation from the advocate, it being possible at the time for any person duly authorised in writing to act before the Supreme Court in criminal cases, and gave his own address as the applicant’s elected domicile for correspondence. The Advocate General (advocaat-generaal) to the Supreme court submitted an advisory opinion to the Supreme Court on 8 May 2001. A copy was transmitted to the last known address of the applicant. However, as appears from the public records, the applicant had already moved to another country on 18 December 2000. The Supreme Court gave judgment on 19 June 2001 dismissing the applicant’s appeal. On 28 August 2001 the Registrar of the Criminal Division wrote to Mr Jurgens in the following terms: “In the above case, in which you act as the representative of the suspect pursuant to a specific letter of authority, the Advocate General Jörg submitted an advisory opinion (enclosed) on 8 May 2001. This advisory opinion was sent to the suspect by letter of 9 May 2001, the latter being offered the possibility to respond. This possibility was not made use of. Subsequently, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal by its judgment of 19 June 2001. You have rightly pointed out to the administrative staff of the Criminal Division that you were not sent a copy of the advisory opinion, as was required by (former) Article 439 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This lapse is regretted and I offer you my apologies for it. Now that the Supreme Court has given its irrevocable judgment (onherroepelijk uitspraak heeft gedaan), it would be entirely pointless to give you the opportunity to react at this stage. That will therefore not be done. Unfortunately, there is now nothing more to be done than to acknowledge that a mistake was made towards you which should not have been allowed to occur. ...”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
5,001-4676,ENG,POL,ADMISSIBILITY,1999,W.S. v. POLAND,4,Inadmissible,Matti Pellonpää,"The applicant is a Polish national, born in 1941 and living in Nysa. . A. By a decision of 14 June 1996 the Treasury Office (Urząd Skarbowy) in Nysa found the applicant guilty of a tax offence punishable under Article 104 of the Fiscal Criminal Act committed in that she had made bookkeeping errors in the bookkeeping of a shop owned and run by her client, and imposed on her a pecuniary penalty of 300 PLZ, or thirty days of imprisonment in default. She was also found guilty of another offence punishable under Article 94 § 4 of the said Act, committed in that she had incorrectly calculated value of a certain tax subject to deduction from Value Added Tax (VAT), which resulted in a reduction of the taxes paid to the Treasury by a sum of 65.24 PLZ For this offence, the Office imposed on her a pecuniary penalty of 100 PLZ, with ten days’ imprisonment in default. The applicant lodged an appeal against this decision with the Opole Treasury Chamber (Izba Skarbowa), arguing that the first-instance authority had breached a fundamental principle of tax law which provided that only the taxpayer, and not persons keeping books for him or her, was liable under the provisions of the Fiscal Offences Act. She further submitted that in fact her calculation of the taxes had been correct. On 29 August 1996 the Opole Treasury Chamber amended in part the decision under appeal by changing the legal qualification of the offence qualified by the lower administrative authority under Article 94 § 3 into an offence against Article 99 § 3, and upheld the decision in its remainder. The Chamber considered that the principle referred to by the applicant in her appeal, i.e. the principle of an exclusive responsibility of a taxpayer towards the State for his or her taxes, was applicable only on the ground of tax law. However, this principle did not apply to the criminal liability as laid down in the Fiscal Criminal Act. Consequently, it was not excluded that an offence punishable under that Act could be committed not only by a taxpayer himself, but also by any person keeping books for the taxpayer on the basis of a contract. On 19 September 1996 the applicant complained to the Minister of Finance about the decisions in her case, contending that they were unlawful. This complaint remained unanswered. B. Relevant domestic law Book One of the Fiscal Criminal Act (Ustawa karna skarbowa) is entitled “Fiscal Crimes and Offences”. Book One is divided into two Parts, General Provisions and Specific Provisions, the latter specifying acts punishable under the Act and setting out penalties imposable on perpetrators. Part One is divided in two Chapters, the first Chapter pertaining to fiscal crimes and the second one to fiscal offences. Under Article 1 of the Fiscal Criminal Act, a wrongful act punishable under the provisions of the said Act by imprisonment, limitation of liberty or a fine constitutes a fiscal crime. A fine cannot be lower than 200 PLZ and cannot exceed 5,000,000 PLZ. Article 13 provides for additional sanctions for fiscal crimes such as: deprivation of civil rights, prohibition to exercise certain activities, confiscation of an object, and publication of the court judgment by which the offender was convicted. Under Article 35 of the Fiscal Criminal Act, a wrongful act punishable under the provisions of the said Act by the imposition of a pecuniary penalty constitutes a fiscal offence. According to Article 41 of the Act, a pecuniary penalty can reach from 20 PLZ to 1,000 PLZ. Under Article 43, the additional sanction of confiscation of an object can be imposed if the Act expressly provides therefor. Under Article 36 of the Act, certain provisions of the Criminal Code, defining certain general notions of criminal responsibility, are applicable in the proceedings concerning fiscal offences. The provisions in question concern, inter alia, the definition of a punishable act, the prohibition of retroactivity, the definition of intentional and non-intentional offence, the age limit for liability, the attempted offence, the aiding and abetting, the circumstances justifying the exclusion of criminal liability, and the principles governing the determination of criminal sanctions. Pursuant to Article 122, the courts are competent to entertain cases concerning responsibility for the commission of fiscal crimes punishable by imprisonment or limitation of liberty. Under Article 123 of the Act, cases concerning fiscal crimes in which only fines can be imposed, and cases concerning fiscal offences, are examined by fiscal administrative boards. Article 206 of the Act states that decisions given in the proceedings concerning fiscal crimes and offences can be appealed against if the law so provides. The remedies are the following: an appeal, a demand that the case be examined by a court, and an appeal against interlocutory decisions. Under Article 208 § 1 of the Act, in cases concerning fiscal crimes, a party to the proceedings is entitled either to lodge an appeal against a first-instance decision of an administrative authority with a higher administrative authority, or to demand that the case be examined by a court. An option to use one remedy bars the use of the other. In the proceedings concerning fiscal offences, only an appeal to a higher administrative authority can be lodged.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
6,001-71642,ENG,LTU,ADMISSIBILITY,2005,BATALOV v. LITHUANIA,4,Inadmissible,,"The applicant, Mr Bislan Batalov, is a Russian national of the Chechen ethnic origin, born in 1979. He is represented before the Court by Mr L. Biekša, a lawyer practising in Vilnius. 1. Proceedings determining the applicant’s status in Lithuania The applicant entered Lithuania illegally on an unspecified date in 2001. He immediately claimed asylum on the ground that he had allegedly taken part in various hostilities against the Russian military forces and that he feared persecution if returned to Russia. He alleged that he had been previously detained by Russian military officers, that he had been beaten and tortured during that detention, and that he had only been released after his relatives had “paid a ransom”. On 14 May 2004 the immigration authorities refused asylum and applied to a court for the applicant’s deportation to Russia. In reaching their conclusion, the immigration authorities referred to the “danger to national security” which the applicant represented. No factual elements were specified to support that statement, the immigration authorities having reached the conclusion on the basis of a letter sent to them by the State Security Department. The decision of 14 May 2004 mentioned that the applicant had the right of appeal to a court within seven days of the notification of the decision, pursuant to Article 138 of the Aliens Act. The decision of 14 May 2004 was translated into Russian and given to the applicant on 14 June 2004, as confirmed by his signature on a copy of the decision submitted to the Court. On 10 June 2004 the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court accepted the immigration authorities’ request to deport the applicant to Russia on the basis of his presenting a danger to national security. On 16 June 2004 the applicant was accommodated at the Aliens Registration Centre (ARC) pending the final determination of his legal status in Lithuania. On 23 June 2004 the applicant applied to a court, claiming asylum and alleging persecution in Russia. On 30 June 2004 the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court dismissed the application on the ground that the applicant had missed the seven day time-limit for the submission of an appeal, laid down in Article 138 of the Aliens Act. In this regard it was noted that the applicant had sent his application by post only on 23 June 2004. The court also noted that the applicant had not specified whether his application was an appeal against the immigration authorities’ decision of 14 May 2004, or against the court decision of 10 June 2004. In either event, the applicant had submitted his appeal out of time. It was further noted that he had not requested an extension of the time-limit for appeal. On 7 July 2004 the applicant received the court decision of 30 June 2004. On 8 July 2004 he consulted a lawyer, who helped him to draft a further appeal against the immigration authorities’ decision of 14 May 2004. In that appeal, dated 9 July 2004, the applicant stated that he had only taken cognisance of the impugned decision on 14 June 2004, and that he had appealed against it on 23 June 2004. Since he did not have a lawyer until 8 July 2004, the applicant requested the reinstatement of the time-limit for appealing against the decision of 14 May 2004. In his appeal, the applicant argued that the authorities’ conclusions on his alleged “danger to national security” were not supported by any evidence. He claimed that he would be subjected to persecution if returned to Russia. On 14 July 2004 the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s request to reinstate the time-limit. The court held that the time-limit mentioned in Article 138 of the Aliens Act could only be reinstated in cases where it had been missed as a result of circumstances independent of the applicant’s will. However, the court observed that the applicant had not invoked any circumstances which could show that he was not in a position to submit his appeal before 23 June 2004. On 27 July 2004 the applicant filed an appeal against the decision of 14 July 2004. The applicant stated that from 14 June 2004, after having taken cognisance of the decision of 14 May 2004, he had been unable to submit his appeal within the seven-day period since he did not know the Lithuanian language or legislation and, moreover, had no postage stamps or envelopes to send an appeal. According to the applicant, on 22 June 2004 he had given his appeal, which had been written in Russian, to a representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), who in turn sent the appeal to the court. The applicant also stated that the UNHCR representative had promised the applicant that he would inform certain immigration lawyers about his situation. As a result, the applicant had been able to meet a lawyer for the first time on 8 July 2004, and to draft a properly motivated appeal on 9 July 2004. On 9 September 2004 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 14 July 2004. The court reiterated that the applicant’s first appeal against the decision of 14 May 2004 had only been sent on 23 June 2004, i.e. more than seven days after the applicant had familiarised himself with the decision (of 14 June 2004). The court observed that the fact that the applicant had access to a lawyer for the first time only on 8 July 2004 did not constitute a circumstance absolving him from the obligation to comply with the time-limit. The court also stated that the other allegations relied on by the applicant (i.e. ignorance of language and laws, and no stationery) could not be reviewed on appeal as these facts had not been alleged before the first-instance court on 14 July 2004. That decision was final. On 22 November 2004 the European Court of Human Rights communicated the applicant’s complaints about his imminent expulsion from Lithuania to Russia under Article 3 of the Convention. On 17 December 2004 the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court suspended the execution of the expulsion order of 10 June 2004. On 14 January 2005 the immigration authorities authorised the applicant’s stay in Lithuania on humanitarian grounds. On 25 March 2005 the President of the Supreme Administrative Court petitioned the Supreme Administrative Court to resume the proceedings concerning the applicant’s expulsion. On 29 March 2005 the Supreme Administrative Court accepted the President’s petition. The case was transmitted for a fresh examination by the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court. On 19 April 2005 the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court quashed the expulsion order of 10 June 2004 inter alia because of a risk of the applicant’s possible persecution if deported to Russia. On 5 July 2005 the immigration authorities issued the applicant with a temporary residence permit on humanitarian grounds. In his letter of 19 July 2005, the applicant stated that, in view of the regularisation of his stay in Lithuania, he no longer wished to pursue his complaints under Article 3 of the Convention. 2. The applicant’s detention The applicant had not been arrested or detained upon his entry into Lithuania in 2001 or immediately thereafter. In early 2004 he lived at an address in Kaunas. On 28 May 2004 the immigration authorities informed the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court that the applicant had not been found at his permanent place of residence, and that as a result he not been acquainted with the decision of 14 May 2004 refusing asylum. On 13 June 2004 the applicant was arrested by the Kaunas police in view of the expulsion order of 10 June 2004. On 14 June 2004 the applicant’s detention (sulaikymas) and placement (apgyvendinimas) at the ARC were authorised by the Kaunas City District Court to ensure the applicant’s eventual expulsion from Lithuania on the basis of Article 113 of the Aliens Act (see the “Relevant domestic law and practice” part below). Detention was authorised until 14 September 2004. On the same date the applicant escaped from the police. A search for him was launched. On 16 June 2004 he was again arrested, brought to and accommodated at the ARC. On 14 September, 14 October 2004 and 13 December 2004, the Švenčionys District Court extended the term of the applicant’s detention, by the latter decision until 15 March 2005. On 3 January 2005 the Švenčionys District Court refused to order the applicant’s release. On 31 January 2005 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed his appeal against the decision of 3 January 2005. In this connection the appeal court noted that the decision on the applicant’s expulsion had not been quashed, although its execution had been suspended by the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court on 17 December 2004. It held that the applicant’s continuing detention was compatible with Article 113 §§ 5 and 7 of the Aliens Act (see the “Relevant domestic law and practice” part below). On 14 February 2005 the Švenčionys District Court refused to order the applicant’s release. On 14 March 2005 the Švenčionys District Court further authorised the applicant’s detention at the ARC until 15 June 2005. The court noted that on 14 January 2005 the immigration authorities had decided to authorise the applicant’s stay in the country on humanitarian grounds, and that, as a result, the ground specified in Article 113 § 2 of the Aliens Act, namely the unlawfulness of his stay in the country, could no longer justify his detention. However, the court observed that the continuing validity of the expulsion order of 10 June 2004 warranted his detention in accordance with Article 113 §§ 5 and 7 of the Aliens Act. On 18 March 2005 the Supreme Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 14 February 2005. On 19 April 2005 the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court quashed the expulsion order of 10 June 2004 inter alia because of a risk of the applicant’s possible persecution if deported to Russia. In view of this decision, on 6 May 2005 the Supreme Administrative Court decided that there were no longer any grounds for the applicant’s detention under Article 113 of the Aliens Act. The decision of 14 March 2005 was accordingly quashed. On 9 May 2005, upon the applicant’s request, his further stay at the ARC was authorised by the immigration authorities under a different regime, namely without any restrictions on his liberty of movement. Following the decision of 5 July 2005 to issue the applicant with a temporary residence permit, he left his accommodation at the ARC on an unspecified date in July 2005. It appears that he now lives in a place of his own choice in Lithuania. According to Article 267 of the Code of Administrative Offences and Article 114 of the Aliens Act of 30 April 2004, an alien can be arrested (sulaikytas) by the police and held for up to 48 hours, in order to determine the legality of his stay in the country. The alien can thereafter be deprived of his liberty only on the basis of a court order. Pursuant to Article 113 of the Aliens Act, an alien may be detained (sulaikytas) if his stay in the country is illegal (Article 113 § 2 of the Act), where a decision has been taken to expel him (Article 113 § 5), or when he presents a danger to public safety and national security (Article 113 § 7). According to Article 116 of the Act, the immigration authorities shall apply to a court for a detention order if one of the grounds specified in Article 113 exists.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
7,001-59163,ENG,AUT,CHAMBER,2001,CASE OF PALLANICH v. AUSTRIA,2,Preliminary objection allowed (non-exhaustion of domestic remedies),Nicolas Bratza,"8. On 17 May 1991 the Walserberg Customs Office (Zollamt) opened criminal proceedings against the applicant under the Tax Offences Act (Finanzstrafgesetz) concerning charges of attempted smuggling, and heard him as a suspect. 9. On 23 May 1991 the Customs Office transmitted the information (Strafanzeige) to the Criminal Department of the Salzburg Customs Office. 10. On 19 June 1991 the Criminal Department of the Salzburg Customs Office, in summary proceedings, issued a penal order (Strafverfügung) against the applicant finding him guilty of attempted smuggling in that he had, on 17 May 1991, when crossing the border between Germany and Austria in his car, failed to declare various goods with a total value of Austrian schillings (ATS) 13,742. The Customs Office imposed a fine of ATS 3,500 on the applicant and, in case of default, two days' imprisonment. Further, it ordered the forfeiture of the sum of ATS 13,742 which had been deposited as a security for the goods concerned. 11. On 26 July 1991 the applicant filed an objection (Einspruch) against the penal order. Thereupon, the Criminal Department of the Salzburg Customs Office, after having carried out investigations, fixed 9 October 1991 as the date for hearing the applicant's case and informed the applicant’s counsel accordingly. 12. On 9 October the Criminal Department of the Salzburg Customs Office held the hearing. Neither the applicant nor his counsel appeared. 13. On 11 November 1991 the Criminal Department of the Salzburg Customs Office, noting that the applicant had, without an excuse, failed to appear at the hearing, convicted him of attempted smuggling, imposing a fine of ATS 3,500, with two days' imprisonment in default. It also upheld the forfeiture of the sum which had been deposited as a security for the goods concerned. 14. On 14 January 1992 the applicant filed an appeal with the Salzburg Regional Directorate of Finance (Finanzlandesdirektion). He submitted, in particular, that he had not declared the goods in question to the customs authorities since he had not intended to import them into Austria but only to transport them through Austria. 15. On 8 June 1995 the Criminal Department of the Salzburg Regional Directorate of Finance dismissed the applicant's appeal. This decision was served on the applicant's counsel on 5 July 1995. 16. Under Article 130 of the Federal Constitution (Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz) the Administrative Court decides inter alia on applications (Beschwerden) in which it is alleged that the administrative authorities have breached their duty to decide. 17. Article 132 of the Federal Constitution, so far as relevant, reads as follows: “An action for breach by the administrative authorities ... of the duty to decide can be lodged by anyone entitled as a party in administrative proceedings to enforce that duty. An action for breach of the duty to decide is inadmissible in administrative criminal proceedings, except private prosecutions and prosecutions in respect of tax offences.” 18. Section 73 of the General Administrative Procedure Act (Allgemeines Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz) deals with the administrative authorities’ duty to decide. So far as relevant, it reads as follows: “(1) Subject to any contrary provision in the administrative regulations, the authorities must give a decision on applications by parties ... and appeals without unnecessary delay and at the latest six months after the application or appeal has been lodged. (2) If the decision is not served on the party within this time-limit, jurisdiction will be transferred to the competent superior authority upon the party’s written request. ...” In proceedings under the Tax Offences Act an application for transfer of jurisdiction to the superior authority is excluded. 19. The relevant provisions of the Administrative Court Act (Verwaltungsgerichtshofgesetz) relating to the application against the administration’s failure to decide read as follows: “An application under Article 132 of the Federal Constitution for breach of the duty to decide (application against the administration’s failure to decide) can be lodged only when the highest authority to which an application can be made in administrative proceedings, either by way of an appeal or an application for transfer of jurisdiction, ... has been applied to by a party and has not made a decision on the matter within six months. ...” “(2) On an application against the administration’s failure to decide under Article 132 of the Federal Constitution the relevant authority is to be ordered to give a decision within three months and either produce to the Administrative Court a copy of the decision or state why in its opinion there has not been a breach of the duty to decide. The time-limit can be extended once if the administrative authority can show that there are relevant reasons why it is impossible to reach a decision within the prescribed time-limit. If a decision is made within the prescribed time-limit, the proceedings in respect of the application against the administration’s failure to decide shall be stayed.” “(1) Subject to any contrary provision of this Federal Act, the Administrative Court shall give a judgment in all cases. ... (4) In respect of applications under Article 132 of the Federal Constitution, the Administrative Court may initially limit its judgment to a decision on specific relevant points of law and order the authority to make a decision consistent with the determined points of law within a specified time-limit which must not exceed eight weeks. If the Administrative Court does not use that possibility or the authority in question fails to comply with the order, the Administrative Court shall rule on the application against the administration’s failure to decide by giving a judgment on the merits, for which it shall have full discretion in the administrative authority’s stead.” 20. According to the Constitutional Court’s judgment of 30 September 1989 (published in the official text collection VfSlg 12167/89) the Administrative Court can be seized with an application against the administration’s failure to decide under Article 132 of the Federal Constitution, taken in conjunction with section 27 of the Administrative Court Act, also where an authority of first instance failed to give a decision within the statutory six month time-limit, provided that no other remedy (such as a request for a transfer of jurisdiction) lies against the failure to decide. 21. According to statistical information provided by the Government, the Administrative Court dealt with a total of 825 applications against the administration’s failure to decide between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 1999. 22. In 67,2 % of the cases (555 of 825) the proceedings resulted in the respondent authority giving a decision within four months from the time when the Administrative Court was seized. The Administrative Court took about a month to issue the order to the respondent authority to give the decision within a three-months time-limit (section 36 § 2 of the Administrative Court Act). In these cases the proceedings before the Administrative Court were discontinued as the applicant’s claim was satisfied (515 of 825 cases), or on the ground that the applicant, having achieved his aim, withdrew the action (40 of 825 cases). In 6,7 % of the cases (55 of 825 cases) the respondent authority failed to comply with the Administrative Court’s order and the Administrative Court had itself to give a decision on the merits under section 42 § 4 of the Administrative Court Act. It did so after an average duration of the proceedings before it of two years and almost three months. The remaining 26,1 % of the cases (215 of 825) were rejected by the Administrative Court for lack of jurisdiction or for other grounds of inadmissibility.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

POLAND,4,No violation of Art. 6-1;No violation of Art. 6-3-d,Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Nebojša Vučinić;Nicolas Bratza;Päivi Hirvelä;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"5. The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Kielce. 6. On 13 December 2000 the police entered premises in B., owned by one of the applicant’s associates, where they discovered a chemical laboratory, substances that turned out to be precursors necessary for the production of narcotics, and various appliances, inter alia, for the production of pills. 7. On 15 December 2000 the applicant was arrested by the police. On 17 December 2000 the Kielce District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) decided to remand him in custody on suspicion of producing psychotropic substances. 8. Subsequently his detention was extended. 9. On 11 December 2001 the applicant was indicted before the Kielce Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) on charges of leading an organised criminal gang that between 1996 and 15 December 2000 had produced large quantities of amphetamine, heroin and cocaine. Simultaneously, three other persons were indicted in the same set of proceedings. 10. At the same time the prosecutor severed other charges against the applicant related to illegal transport of psychotropic substances to Austria and other European countries and releasing drugs into circulation in those countries. 11. On 15 January 2002 the trial court held the first hearing in the case. 12. On 27 November 2002 the Kielce Regional Court held a hearing at which the prosecutor sought to read out statements made by a certain W.P. as well as by J.K., B.S., and G.C. The applicant’s lawyer objected to this, submitting that the statements in question had been made before the Austrian courts in another set of criminal proceedings in which those individuals had been the accused, and thus they had not received a warning about criminal liability for making untruthful statements. He also submitted that the Polish authorities had made no attempt to hear those individuals in Poland at the preparatory stage of the proceedings. Moreover, he challenged the legal basis that could allow statements made before foreign courts to be read out. Nevertheless, the trial court decided to read out the statements made by W.P. and others. The court based its decision on Article 587 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and others, which allowed statements made by both witnesses and accused in another set of proceedings to be read out. It agreed that it had not been obvious whether this provision could be applicable to a situation where the actions of foreign authorities had not been taken at the request of the Polish authorities; however this doubt had been dismissed by the Supreme Court in its decision of 28 March 2002. The Regional Court examined the rules of Austrian Criminal Procedure and concluded that they did not conflict with the principles and guarantees provided by the Polish legal order. 13. At a hearing held on 20 February 2003 the trial court started reading out the statements of W.P. and others. The applicant contested the truthfulness of W.P.’s testimony. 14. On 19 March 2003 the applicant’s lawyers requested the trial court, inter alia, to hear witnesses W.P. and B.S. in person before the trial court in order to confront them. They pointed to discrepancies in their statements which could only be verified by hearing them in person before the trial court. 15. On the same date the Regional Prosecutor submitted to the court his reply to the applicant’s request, in which he was not opposed to W.P. and B.S. being heard by a delegated judge, as they had not so far been heard by the Polish authorities in connection with this set of proceedings. 16. On 26 March 2003 the Kielce Regional Court refused the applicant’s request for W.P. and B.S. to be heard in person without specifying the reasons for the refusal. 17. On 30 May 2003 the trial court gave judgment in the case. The applicant was convicted of the following offences, committed on an unspecified date between 1997 and 15 December 2000: 1) storing and possessing large quantities of psychotropic substances, 2) storing, owning and acquiring equipment necessary for illegal production of psychotropic substances, and 3) producing large quantities of psychotropic substances, particularly amphetamines. The court found that the applicant had acted together with three accomplices; however it acquitted him of the charge of leading an organised criminal gang. The court sentenced the applicant to nine years’ imprisonment and a fine. 18. The facts of the case were established on the basis of the following: 1) expert opinions submitted by nine different experts, including an opinion prepared in cooperation with the Forensic Institute in Wiesbaden (Germany); 2) statements made by thirtythree individuals, witnesses and coaccused; 3) statements made by W.P., B.S. and others heard before the Austrian authorities, including those read out at the hearing; 4) documents: records of searches of premises, notes on use of a police dog and scent identification, records of in situ inspection, forensic opinions, documents, inspection of pieces of evidence produced at the hearing, documents held in the secret registry, documents submitted by witness T.S., photographic documentation of pieces of evidence, and official correspondence related to pieces of evidence. Some of the evidence referred to above had been collected in another set of criminal proceedings against the applicant (regarding charges severed in 2001, see paragraph 10 above). 19. In reconstructing the facts of the case the trial court firstly examined the type and quantity of chemical substances seized during the search of five rooms of the laboratory in B. and the possible time frame of the activity of the laboratory. The written reasons of the judgment in this respect are detailed and extensive. The court examined at length the results of the searches of the laboratory, which had been conducted by several experts, who had collected about 100 samples of chemical substances as well as video and photographic evidence. The trial court examined the scientific methodology employed by experts, and the procedures followed, in the light of the allegations made by the accused that some of the evidence against them had been fabricated. 20. The court further examined the involvement of each of the coaccused in the activities with which they had been charged. As regards the applicant, the trial court referred to comparisons made by Polish and German experts of chemical substances found in the laboratory to ecstasy pills confiscated in several European countries, notably in Austria. The experts considered that it was most probable that the drugs found abroad had been produced in the laboratory in B. The link between the applicant, the other coaccused, and the activity of the laboratory was established on the basis of various pieces of evidence examined at length by the trial court as well as circumstantial evidence. 21. The trial court assessed the credibility of statements obtained from W.P. and others by the Austrian courts and investigating authorities, which had been read out at the hearing, and determined that they were worthy evidence (pełnowartościowy materiał dowodowy). They enabled the existence of personal connections between the applicant and drug dealers arrested in Austria, in particular W.P., to be established The court considered this evidence to corroborate what had been established by experts, namely that the drugs found abroad had in fact been produced in the laboratory in B. The trial court considered that W.P. in his statements had been incriminating himself to a far greater extent than the applicant. W.P. considered himself the main organiser of drugrelated dealings and depicted the applicant as an ineffective executor of his instructions. 22. On 31 December 2003 the applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment. He complained in particular that W.P.’s statements, as well as those of three other witnesses, had been read out before the trial court although they had not been requested by the Polish authorities as provided by Article 587 of the Code. The applicant also contested the trial court’s refusal of his request for W.P. to be heard in person. Moreover, the appeal challenged the trial court’s finding that the applicant had been producing drugs up to 15 December 2000. He submitted that the condition of the laboratory when it was searched on 13 December 2000 showed that it had not been used recently. Thus the trial court was wrong to conclude that the applicant had been committing an offence continuously up to 15 December 2000 and to apply the more severe legal regulation that entered into force on 12 December 2000. 23. The prosecutor also lodged an appeal, alleging that it had been sufficiently proved that the applicant had acted as a leader of an organised criminal gang. 24. On 8 April 2004 the Krakow Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) held a hearing and upheld the impugned judgment. The court considered that the firstinstance court had been right to read out the statements of W.P. and others made before the Austrian court and that it had correctly applied the legal provisions in the light of the Supreme Court’s interpretation set out in its decision of 28 March 2002. The appellate court also dismissed the arguments that the applicant had not been producing any illegal substances immediately before and after 12 December 2000. The court considered that the police had secured in his laboratory large quantities of substances for the production of narcotics, with appliances which had not been dismantled and showed signs of recent use. According to the court, a laboratory of that kind did not work steadily and produce constantly, but had periods of stagnation, waiting for the following stages of the production, but nevertheless with the intention of continuing such activity. 25. In addition to the above-mentioned circumstantial evidence, the Court of Appeal analysed at length the statements made by W.P. and other witnesses heard in Austria and assessed their usefulness and veracity. It underlined that the applicant had never contested that he knew W.P. and had met him on several occasions, allegedly in the capacity of an expert consultant in chemistry. The court noted that W.P. had disclosed many elements of his dealings, which only in part concerned the applicant, without attempting to minimise his own role. His statements were considered logical and trustworthy and corroborated by those made by other witnesses. 26. On 15 July 2004 the applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy). 27. On 19 October 2004 the Supreme Court decided not to hear the cassation appeal and refused to prepare written reasons for its decision. 28. Article 390 § 1 of the 1997 Code of Criminal Procedure (“the Code”) provides: “The accused has a right to be present during the taking of evidence in the proceedings.” 29. Article 391 of the Code provides as follows: “1. If a witness has without good reason refused to testify, or has made a statement which differs from a previous one, or has stated that he does not remember certain details, or if he is abroad, or a summons cannot be served on him, or if he has not appeared for good reason or if the president of the court has declined to summon him pursuant to Article 333 § 2 [because upon the lodging of the bill of indictment the prosecution has asked that the records of his testimony be read out at trial], and also when a witness has died, the records of his previous statements may be read out, [regardless of whether they] have been made in the investigation or before the court in the case in question or in another case or in any other procedure provided for by the law. 2. In the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1, and also in the case specified in Article 182 § 3, the records of evidence that a witness has given when heard as an accused may also be read out.” 30. According to Article 587 of the Code: “The official records of inspections, testimonies given by accused, witnesses or experts, or records of other evidentiary actions prepared upon a request from a Polish court or prosecutor, by the courts or prosecutors of foreign countries or by agencies performing under their supervision, may be read out at a hearing in accordance with the principles prescribed in Articles 389, 391 and 393. This may be done provided that the manner in which these actions are performed does not conflict with the principles of legal order in the Republic of Poland.” 31. According to Article 590 § 4 of the Code, the provision above is applicable also to evidentiary materials obtained abroad even if the actions have not been taken at the request of a Polish court or prosecutor. 32. Section 40 (2) of the 1997 Prevention of Drug Addiction Act (Ustawa o przeciwdziałaniu narkomanii) provided that production of large quantities of psychotropic substances was liable to a penalty of up to five years’ imprisonment. On 26 October 2000 the Act was amended with effect from 12 December 2000. As required by the amended section 40 (2) of the Act the offence in question became liable to a penalty of a minimum of three years’ imprisonment; no maximum liability was set.",[],[],[],['6'],"['6-1', '6-3']",['6-3-d'],0
9,001-76776,ENG,HRV,ADMISSIBILITY,2006,GAVELLA v. CROATIA,1,Inadmissible,Christos Rozakis,"The applicant, Mr Nikola Gavella, is a Croatian national who was born in 1937 and lives in Zagreb. He was represented before the Court by Mrs I. K. Vucelić, a lawyer practising in Zagreb. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs Š. Stažnik. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 1 January 1997 the Act on the Restitution of and Compensation for Property Expropriated during the Yugoslav Communist Regime (“the Denationalisation Act”) entered into force. Pursuant to section 22 of the Denationalisation Act, nationalised flats in respect of which third persons had acquired specially protected tenancies (stanarsko pravo) were not to be restored to their former owners. The tenants had a right to purchase such flats from the Fund for the Restitution of and Compensation for Expropriated Property (Fond za naknadu oduzete imovine – “the Fund”) under favourable conditions set out in the Specially Protected Tenancies (Sale to Occupier) Act. At the same time, the former owners or their heirs were entitled to financial compensation in respect of the flats. In addition, section 29 of the Denationalisation Act provided that, in the event of subsequent “disposal in rem” of flats purchased by such tenants, the former owners had the right of pre-emption (pravo prvokupa). In such cases, the new owner (the former tenant) was obliged to offer it first to the former owner for the same price as he or she had paid to the Fund. If the former owner accepted the offer and concluded a contract of sale with the new owner, he or she had to pay the Fund the difference between the sale price and the amount of financial compensation previously received. Pursuant to section 29 (2) of the Denationalisation Act, the right of pre-emption was to be noted (zabilježba) in the land register on the basis of a mandatory clause to be inserted into every contract of sale concluded between a tenant and the Fund. Three residential buildings in the centre of Zagreb had been owned by the applicant's family and were nationalised during the Communist regime. On 2 February and 29 March 2001 respectively, the Office for Property Affairs of the City of Zagreb (Grad Zagreb, Gradski ured za imovinskopravne poslove) issued two decisions finding that the applicant, as the sole heir of his late mother, E.G., was entitled to financial compensation in the amount of 2,763,164 Croatian kunas in respect of 27 flats situated in the nationalised buildings. Twenty-five percent of the compensation was to be paid within six months of the decisions becoming final, while the rest was to be paid in State bonds in 40 twice-yearly instalments over the period between 1 January 2000 and 1 July 2019. The applicant submitted that he had renounced his pre-emption rights in respect of five of the flats. In 1996 24 members of the upper house of Parliament – the House of Counties (Županijski dom Sabora Republike Hrvatske) – lodged an application with the Constitutional Court challenging the constitutionality of the Denationalisation Act (application for abstract constitutional review – zahtjev za ocjenu ustavnosti) under section 13 of the 1991 Constitutional Act on the Constitutional Court (“the 1991 Constitutional Court Act”). In addition, in the period between 1996 and 1999, the Constitutional Court received 64 petitions lodged by various individuals requesting the institution of proceedings to review the constitutionality of the Denationalisation Act (petition for abstract constitutional review – prijedlog za ocjenu ustavnosti) under section 15 of the 1991 Constitutional Court Act. On 21 April 1999 the Constitutional Court delivered a single decision on the above application and petitions. It quashed certain provisions of the Denationalisation Act as unconstitutional. Among other provisions, the Constitutional Court quashed section 29 (1), which provided for pre-emption rights for former owners. As a result, the applicant lost his right of pre-emption. The Constitutional Court held that the constitutionally protected right to ownership included the right to dispose of a property, which meant, inter alia, the right to sell it at a contracted (market) price. Since the statutory right of pre-emption restricted the right of disposal, thereby placing a limitation on the constitutional right of ownership, that limitation had to meet the aim which it sought to achieve. The aim of the right of pre-emption was to protect former owners and the legal order against any unjustifiable profit which the new owner of a flat (the former tenant) might make by selling it at the market price (having previously bought it from the Fund at a significantly lower price). However, it was not necessary to provide for the right of pre-emption in perpetuity in order to meet that aim. Instead, the aim could have been achieved by imposing a reasonable time-limit. A perpetual right of pre-emption was not proportionate to the aim pursued, and therefore constituted an excessive restriction on the rights of current owners, hampering even socially desirable disposal of property (aimed, for example, at meeting the housing needs of the owner's immediate family members) and paralysing real property transactions to a significant extent. In addition, section 29 (1) was found to be contrary to the principle of legal certainty and thereby to the rule of law, on account of the vague and imprecise nature of the terms used. In particular, it was not clear whether the right of pre-emption in question constituted a right in rem or in personam (and if the latter was the case, whether it existed for the lifetime of the former or the current owner). Moreover, the Constitutional Court held that the use of the term “disposal in rem” (which, apart from sale, could involve other forms of alienation and mortgaging of the property) to describe an event triggering the former owner's right of pre-emption, was inconsistent with the other provisions of the Denationalisation Act, which used the term “sale” to describe the same event. The Constitutional Court deferred the effects of its decision by giving the legislature one year to comply with the decision and enact amendments to the Denationalisation Act to replace the unconstitutional provisions. The quashed provisions were to lose their legal force with the entry into force of the envisaged amendments, but no later than one year from the date of publication of the court's decision. The decision was published in the Official Gazette on 23 April 1999. Following several requests by the Government, the Constitutional Court extended this time-limit on five occasions. The time-limit was finally set at 1 July 2002. On 5 July 2002 Parliament adopted amendments to the Denationalisation Act (“the Amendments”) which entered into force on the same day. Section 4 of the Amendments repealed sections 29, 30 and 31 of the Denationalisation Act, that is, the provisions providing for pre-emption rights for former owners. Parliament did not accept the Government's bill, which provided for pre-emption rights for former owners in the event of a flat's subsequent sale, donation or exchange, for a period of fifteen years. It considered that the proposed solution would result in an undesirable stalemate whereby the current owner would have no incentive to sell his or her flat, and therefore making it impossible for former owners to make use of their right of pre-emption. If adopted, the bill would impose an excessive burden on the current owners while not benefiting the former owners. Moreover, since property transactions concerning these flats would be paralysed, it would deprive the State of the taxation revenue from such transactions. On 19 August 2002 the applicant requested the Constitutional Court to institute proceedings to review the constitutionality of the Amendments (petition for abstract constitutional review), arguing that they were in breach of the Constitution. The Constitutional Court has not yet decided on the applicant's petition. The relevant provisions of the 1990 Croatian Constitution (Ustav Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette nos. 56/1990, 135/97, 113/2000 and 28/2001) read as follows: “Rights and freedoms may be restricted only by law, in order to protect the rights and freedoms of others, the legal order, public morals or public health.” “1. The right of ownership is guaranteed. 2. Ownership implies duties. Owners and users of property shall contribute to the general welfare.” “1. Property may be restricted or taken in accordance with the law and in the interest of the Republic of Croatia subject to payment of compensation equal to its market value. 2. The exercise...of property rights may, on an exceptional basis, be restricted by law for the protection of the interests and security of the Republic of Croatia, nature, the environment or public health.” “The Croatian Parliament shall: - ... - enact statutes, ...” The relevant provisions of the Constitutional Act on the Constitutional Court (Ustavni zakon o Ustavnom sudu, Official Gazette no. 13/1991 of 21 March 1991), as in force in the material time, provided as follows: “An application instituting proceedings before the Constitutional Court may be submitted by: Parliament; one-third of the members of each House of Parliament; the President of the Republic of Croatia; the Government of the Republic of Croatia, to review the constitutionality and legality of subordinate legislation; the Supreme Court of the Republic of Croatia, if the issue of constitutionality and legality has arisen in proceedings before a court; the Ombudsman, in proceedings under Article 83 of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia; ...” “Everyone has the right to request the institution of proceedings to review the constitutionality of statutes... The Constitutional Court may of its own motion institute proceedings to review the constitutionality of statutes...” “(1) The Constitutional Court shall quash a statute or its provisions if it finds that they are incompatible with the Constitution. (2) Unless the Constitutional Court decides otherwise, the quashed statute or its provisions shall cease to have legal force on the day of publication of the Constitutional Court's decision in the Official Gazette.” Sections 527-33 of the Civil Obligations Act (Zakon o obveznim odnosima, Official Gazette nos. 53/1991, 73/1991, 3/1994, 7/1996, 112/1999), as in force in the material time, laid down general rules (lex generalis) concerning pre-emption rights. Section 531 provided that the contractual right of pre-emption would expire five years after the conclusion of the contract of sale, unless it was stipulated that it would expire earlier. Section 533 provided, inter alia, that the statutory right of pre-emption was of unlimited duration. The relevant provisions of the Act on the Restitution of and Compensation for Property Expropriated during the Yugoslav Communist Regime (Zakon o naknadi za imovinu oduzetu za vrijeme jugoslavenske komunističke vladavine, Official Gazette no. 92/96 of 30 October 1996), as in force in the material time, read as follows: “(1) Unless expropriated by confiscation, flats [...] let under specially protected tenancies shall not be returned to their former owners. ... (3) The former owner shall have the right to compensation and the holder of the specially protected tenancy shall have the right to purchase the flat.” “The contract referred to in paragraph 2 of this section [by which the Fund sells the flat to the holder of the specially protected tenancy] shall stipulate, in the form of a mandatory clause, the right of pre-emption in favour of the former owner in case of further disposal in rem of the purchased flat. The right of pre-emption shall be noted (zabilježba) in the land register.” “(1) In the case of further disposal in rem of the flat purchased [from the Fund], the former owner shall have the right of pre-emption. (2) The right of pre-emption of the former owner shall be noted in the land register of the competent court. (3) The owner of a purchased flat who intends to sell it shall, through the notary public, offer the flat for sale to the former owner and notify him or her of the price [paid by the owner when he or she purchased the flat from the Fund] and the terms and conditions of the sale.” Paragraph 5 provided that the former owner, within sixty days of conclusion of the contract of sale with the flat owner, had to (re)pay to the Fund the difference between the price set forth in paragraph 3 and the amount he or she had received in compensation for the nationalised flat. Paragraphs 4, 6 and 7 set forth in detail the obligations of the current owner (former tenant) in respect of the former owner's right of pre-emption. Section 30 of the Act provided for the remedies (a civil action) available to the former owner if the current owner failed to observe his or her right of pre-emption. Section 31 stated that no turnover tax was payable on the sale of the flat, in accordance with the former owner's right of pre-emption.

10,001-70235,ENG,GBR,ADMISSIBILITY,2005,C. B. v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,4,Inadmissible,Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant, C.B., is a British national who was born in 1994 and lives in Frome. She is represented before the Court by FDC Solicitors, practising in Frome. The applicant was born on 9 December 1994. On 31 November 1995, the applicant was assaulted by her mother’s boyfriend. She suffered severe injury – left hemiplegia, blindness and severe mental impairment. She required full time care provided by her grandparents who were appointed her legal guardians. On 16 October 1997, the applicant’s grandparents made an application on her behalf to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (""CICA""). They instructed solicitors to present her claims to the Authority. The solicitors obtained inter alia medical reports and reports as to her future needs (care, accommodation, transport, holiday etc). The fees exceeded GBP 35,000. Pursuant to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 1995, costs of representation in pursuing a claim were not recoverable (paragraph 18). By letter dated 20 November 2002, CICA informed the applicant that they were minded to make an interim award of GBP 320,000. The applicant’s solicitors responded by insisting that they issue a final award. By letter dated 28 February 2003, CICA informed the applicant that they had made a final award of GBP 406,246. They rejected the large claim for future costs once she became an adult on the basis that these would be largely met by the local authority. In June 2003, CICA informed the applicant that they had reviewed the award and would increase it to the statutory maximum of GBP 500,000. The applicant’s solicitors and CICA have been in subsequent negotiation concerning the type of trust that should be set up to administer the fund. Apparently the money has yet to be transferred. Meanwhile, in August 2002 an action was taken on her behalf challenging the compatibility of paragraph 18 of the Scheme with Articles 6 and 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. On 22 May 2003, the High Court rejected the applicant’s claims. Mr Justice Mitting noted: ""It has never been in doubt that her claim is well-founded and cannot be subject to any reduction on the grounds of her conduct or character. The only issue for the Authority to decide has been the amount of compensation which should be awarded to her. On any view it was always going to be substantial."" He found that the obligation for an applicant to make out his case did not require him to obtain at his own expense all the professional reports necessary to prove the nature and extent of his injuries and their impact upon his life and the cost of alleviating it. Once he had demonstrated significant injury and that cost would be incurred in alleviating it, the burden of investigating both elements fell on the Authority. Under paragraph 18, the Authority were, however, under no obligation to reimburse costs of representation, including drafting and submitting the application, advising on the application, negotiating with the Authority and responding to the Authority’s queries. Although a well-founded claim to compensation under the Scheme was acknowledged by all parties to be a ""civil right"" under Article 6, he did not consider that the requirement under the scheme for applicants, who chose to obtain legal representation to assist in their claims, to bear those costs either restricted their ability to apply to the Authority or deprived them of a fair determination of their claim. He rejected the claim of the discriminatory effect on the applicant’s pecuniary rights due to her position as a severely handicapped child, considering that the applicant was in the same situation as anyone with a complex claim who would be likely to want to seek some professional legal advice. Further the applicant’s grandparents could make any decisions which an adult could make. On 11 February 2004, after a hearing, the Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s appeal. It noted that meanwhile the Authority had accepted that they should pay for various medical and expert reports and commented strongly on the delay in making a final award, where the severity of her injuries plainly fell in the highest tariff category. It seemed to have been principally because of the Authority’s dilatoriness that the applicant’s solicitors became engaged in establishing each element of her claim and bespoke specialists’ reports and counsel’s advice in order to do so. Lord Justice Sedley noted that the parties agreed that Article 6 applied to the scheme but considered that as the scheme had operated in this case no violation of the applicant’s rights arose: ""... ought the Scheme, in order to comply with C.’s Article 6 § 1 right to a fair hearing provide for the reimbursement of her solicitor’s full bill of costs? This now exceeds GBP 28,500; it covers a wide range of inquiries and the fees of leading and junior counsel. C. has never faced the prospect of being unable to pay these costs, and because of the willingness of her solicitors to defer payment her lack of funds and that of her grandparents has not impeded her access to the CICA. I am less impressed by Mr Crow’s argument (though it found favour with Mitting J) that, so long as she has competent adults to act for her, C. is at no disadvantage at all. Given the unnecessarily complex course taken by the CICA, the grandparents were as much in need of advice and representation as C. was. But C.’s situation, even so, is not analogous with Mrs Airey’s, nor with that of an impecunious claimant needing to establish a primary entitlement. Her situation is that of a person whose right of access to the CICA is recognised and effective (though impeded by prevarication) but whose carers, very reasonably, want to ensure that the award she obtains is as full as it should be. To that end they have committed a part of the eventual fund to obtaining representation. It is the intent of the Scheme that where this happens it is not to be at the CICA’s expense. That the Scheme could have provided otherwise is clear; but it does not follow that it was bound to provide otherwise in order to give effect to C.’s Convention right ... In my judgment it has not been shown that the Scheme invades C.’s human rights in this regard. It diminishes her award by the cost of her representation; but while many people would regard this as unfair, it does not deprive her of the possibility of a fair hearing within the meaning of Article 6 § 1..."" On 26 July 2004, written confirmation was received that the House of Lords refused leave to appeal finding no arguable point of law of general public importance. Compensation for persons who suffered criminal injuries was provided for originally by an exercise of the Royal Prerogative. The modern statutory scheme was set up under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 1995. Under section 1(1), it is provided that: “The Secretary of State shall make arrangements for the payment of compensation to, or in respect of, persons who have sustained one or more criminal injuries.” At the relevant time, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 1995 laid out the applicable rules. Paragraph 18: ""It will be for the applicant to make out his case ... Where an applicant is represented, the costs of representation will not be met by the Authority."" Paragraph 20: “Where a claims officer considers that an examination of the injury is required before a decision can be reached, the Authority will make arrangements for such an examination by a duly qualified medical practitioner. Reasonable expenses incurred by the applicant in that connection will be met by the Authority.” Section 6(1) provides: “It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.” Section 8 provides: “(1) In relation to any act (or proposed act) of a public authority which the court finds is (or would be) unlawful, it may grant such relief or remedy or make such order, within its powers, as it considers just and appropriate. (2) But damages may be awarded only by a court which has power to award damages, or to order the payment of compensation, in civil proceedings.”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
11,001-91784,ENG,ROU,ADMISSIBILITY,2009,COSTESCU v. ROMANIA,4,Inadmissible,Alvina Gyulumyan;Corneliu Bîrsan;Egbert Myjer;Elisabet Fura;Josep Casadevall;Luis López Guerra,"1. The applicants, Mr Romulus Nicolae Costescu and Mrs Alice Costescu, are Romanian nationals who were born in 1932 and 1933 respectively and live in Bucharest. They were represented before the Court by Mr Malik Nekaa, a lawyer practising in Lyon. The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Răzvan-Horaţiu Radu, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 3. From 1984 the applicants lived in an apartment rented from the State in a nationalised building. On 4 November 1996, under Law no. 112/1995 on the legal status of certain residential property, the applicants bought their apartment from the State, represented by the mayor of Bucharest. 4. On 22 June 1998 C.S., the former owner's heir, took action against the State and the applicants for recovery of possession of the flat, seeking also to have the 1996 sale declared null and void. 5. In a judgment of 6 October 2000 the Bucharest District Court found in favour of C.S. and ordered the applicants to surrender possession of the apartment. It considered that the State's initial title deed had been null and void and therefore gave preference to C.S.'s title, which had come from the apartment's real owner. The court refused however to declare the sale contract null and void, as no cause of nullity was identified and the applicants had acted in good faith. 6. In a final decision of 18 September 2001 the Bucharest Court of Appeal upheld that judgment. 7. On 11 July 2007, in the presence of a bailiff, C.S. took possession of the apartment. 8. On 22 May 2000 the applicants asked for the mayor of Bucharest to be joined to the proceedings for restitution of property lodged against them (see paragraph 4 above). Under the Civil Code guarantee concerning responsibility for eviction, the applicants sought to recover the apartment's market value from the authorities. 9. On 26 May 2000 the District Court considered that the applicants' request had been made out of time and decided to separate it from the main file. 10. Several hearings took place before the Bucharest District Court. On 8 December 2000, at C.S.'s request, the case was suspended pending the outcome of the action for recovery of possession. 11. A new hearing was scheduled for 20 July 2001, but none of the parties attended. On that date the District Court noted the parties' unjustified absence and suspended the proceedings once again. 12. The District Court summonsed the parties to a hearing on 2 September 2002. 13. On 14 August 2002 the applicants requested that the case be postponed until after 10 November 2002, as they were going to be absent from the country from 22 August to 30 October 2002. 14. On 2 September 2002 the District Court noted the parties' absence and set a new hearing date for 30 September. 15. In a judgment of 30 September 2002 the District Court noted that the case had been suspended since 20 July 2001 and that the parties had not manifested any interest in it since then. It therefore concluded that the action had become extinct (perimată). 16. The applicants did not appeal against that judgment, which became final. 17. Under Romanian law, an action for recovery of possession is one of the principal remedies for the protection of a right of property. Such action is not governed by statute per se but has emerged from case-law. An action for recovery of possession can be defined as the bringing of proceedings to enforce a right in rem in which a dispossessed owner claims back his or her property from the person currently in possession of it. When both the plaintiff and the defendant have a title deed, the court must compare the two deeds and decide which one is preferred. The main outcome of such an action, if successful, is the acknowledgment by the court of the claimant's title to the property, with retrospective effect, thus obliging the defendant to return the property. If physical restitution is no longer possible, that obligation is replaced by an obligation to pay compensation on the basis of an equivalent sum (see Străin and Others v. Romania, no. 57001/00, § 26, ECHR 2005VII). 18. Articles 1337-1351 of the Civil Code institute the seller's responsibility for eviction. They provide for the evicted buyer to claim reimbursement of the price and also the payment of costs and damages, regardless of the seller's good or bad faith. The buyer can either join the seller to the proceedings instituted against him by the third party or lodge a new action against the seller after having been evicted. In the latter case, if the seller proves that he could have won the case against the third party had he been joined to the proceedings, he will be exempted from compensating the buyer (Article 1351 of the Civil Code). A bona fide buyer continues to enjoy the benefits of the property until he is no longer considered bona fide, that is at the latest when the action for eviction is lodged against him, at which time enjoyment of the property reverts to the rightful owner. However, the buyer may still claim compensation for his loss from the seller. 19. The constant practice of the domestic courts between 2005 and 2008, as available to the Court, indicates that the Civil Code guarantee in the event of eviction is applied in cases similar to the one at hand, and the interested parties are awarded the indexed purchase price and, in most cases, damages and any costs reasonably incurred for the upkeep of the house. Most of the domestic courts consider that Law no. 10/2001 on the rules governing immovable property wrongfully seized by the State between 6 March 1945 and 22 December 1989 (“Law no. 10/2001”) is not applicable to actions for recovery of possession when the sale contract is not declared null and void in such proceedings. 20. If the sale contract is cancelled, however, the courts consistently apply Law no. 10/2001 and only award the buyer the indexed purchase price. 21. In decision no. 520/C of 3 December 2007 the Constanţa Court of Appeal found in favour of the buyer in an action for recovery of possession lodged by the former owner of a nationalised apartment against the person who in good faith had bought the apartment from the State in 2000. The court decided that the restitution of the apartment to the former owner was no longer possible and, based on the Court's case-law on Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (in particular: Pincová and Pinc v. the Czech Republic, no. 36548/97, ECHR 2002VIII, Raicu v. Romania, no. 28104/03, 19 October 2006, and Păduraru v. Romania, no. 63252/00, ECHR 2005XII (extracts)), it compelled the State to pay the market value of the apartment in compensation to the former owner. In the court'tary award was the only solution to the action for recovery of possession. 22. In a similar decision of 12 December 2007 the High Court of Cassation and Justice found in favour of the buyer in an action for recovery of possession lodged by the former owner. The High Court took account of the fact that the buyer's title had been confirmed by the courts in an action in nullity of the sale contract lodged against him by the former owner whereas the former owner's title had not been upheld by a court. It further considered that dispossessing the buyer regardless of the circumstances, in order to restore the property to the former owner, would create disproportionate new wrongs in the attempt to attenuate old injuries. It also considered, in a general statement, that reimbursement of the indexed purchase price under Law no. 10/2001 could not compensate the buyer as it did not reflect the property's market value. 23. In decision no. 1055 of 9 October 2008 the Constitutional Court declared Article 47 of Law no. 10/2001 unconstitutional in so far as it breached the buyer's property title. Under the provision concerned, persons whose actions based on the Civil Code had been dismissed before the entry into force of Law no. 10/2001 could use this Law in order once again to seek the restitution of their property. The Constitutional Court considered that persons whose title to property had been confirmed by a court decision could not be compelled to surrender that property where there was no serious justification for such a measure, based on public order, under Article 44 § 3 of the Constitution.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

De Gaetano,"The applicant is a private company with headquarters in Teslić, Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was represented before the Court by Mr S. Đorđević and Mr S. Mikić, lawyers practising in Doboj. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Government”) were represented by their Deputy Agent, Ms Z. Ibrahimović. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant company had a right of allocation with respect to a flat in Teslić (as explained below, the allocation right holders were socially owned enterprises and other public bodies which administered socially owned flats in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia). On 29 October 1998 it initiated administrative proceedings for the eviction of D.N. who had remained in the flat after the death of his grandfather. On 19 February 2001 the competent first-instance administrative body ruled that the occupancy right over the flat could not be transferred to D.N. from his late grandfather and, accordingly, ordered his eviction. On 5 April 2001 and 14 May 2002, respectively, the competent second-instance administrative body and the Supreme Court of the Republika Srpska upheld that decision. D.N. was evicted on 13 September 2002. On 16 July 2002 D.N. complained to the Human Rights Chamber, a domestic human-rights body, about the outcome of the administrative proceedings mentioned above, relying on Articles 6 and 8 of, and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to, the European Convention on Human Rights. On 8 February 2007 the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the legal successor of the Human Rights Chamber) found a violation of D.N.’s right to respect for his home, quashed the Supreme Court decision of 14 May 2002 and ordered that he be reinstated in the flat. The applicant company was informed of that decision through the housing authorities on 12 August 2007. On 5 September 2007 the Supreme Court, pursuant to the Constitutional Court decision, quashed the decisions of 19 February 2001 and 5 April 2001 and ruled against the applicant company. It would appear that the applicant company has subsequently agreed to the privatisation of the flat by D.N. under the Privatisation of Flats Act 2000 (see below). In the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia practically all flats were under the regime of “social ownership”. They were generally built by socially owned enterprises or other public bodies for allocation to their employees, who became “occupancy right holders”. The rights of both the allocation right holders (public bodies which nominally controlled the flats) and the occupancy right holders were regulated by law (the Housing Act 1984, which is still in force in Bosnia and Herzegovina). In accordance with this Act, an occupancy right, once allocated, entitled the occupancy right holder to permanent, lifelong use of the flat against the payment of a nominal fee. When occupancy right holders died, their rights transferred, as a matter of right, to their surviving spouses or registered members of their family households who were also using the flat (see sections 19 and 21 of that Act). In practice, these provisions on transfer meant that occupancy rights originally allocated by public bodies to their employees could pass, as of right, to multiple generations for whom the initial employment-based link to the allocation right holder no longer existed (for more information about socially owned flats see Đokić v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 6518/04, §§ 5-8, 27 May 2010). The concept of “social ownership” was abandoned during the 1992-95 war . As a result, socially owned flats were effectively nationalised. Under the Privatisation of Flats Act 2000, which entered into force on 2 March 2000, the occupancy right holders were entitled to purchase their flats. Furthermore, the role of the allocation right holders changed. They are now obliged to agree to the privatisation of flats if the occupancy right holder so requests (see section 13 of that Act), or, in the absence of such a request, to let out the flat (section 61(1) of that Act). In both cases, the proceeds (that is, the purchase price or the rent) are to be paid to the Republika Srpska Housing Fund (sections 36 and 40(3) of that Act).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The domestic courts justified the applicant’s pretrial detention by the existence of strong evidence against him and the likelihood that a severe penalty would be imposed, as well as by the need to secure the proper course of the proceedings. The authorities emphasised that the applicant had to undergo psychiatric observation at the hospital and that a number of expert reports had to be obtained. On an unspecified date the applicant was indicted for murder, namely, intentionally strangling his former wife. On 16 November 2001 the Łódź Regional Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to 15 years’ imprisonment and 8 years’ deprivation of public rights. Pending appeal, on 8 May 2002 the Łódź Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) dismissed a request by the applicant to lift the preventive measure and decided to further extend his detention. On 23 July 2002 the Łódź Court of Appeal quashed the judgment in the part concerning the deprivation of public rights and upheld the remainder of the judgment. On 8 October 2003 the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) quashed the first and second-instance judgments and remitted the case to the Regional Court. In a separate decision of 8 October 2003 the Supreme Court extended the applicant’s detention, relying on the likelihood that a severe penalty would be imposed. On 16 December 2003 the Łódź Regional Court dismissed a request by the applicant for the preventive measure in question to be lifted and decided to further extend his detention. To justify the applicant’s protracted detention the court reiterated the grounds which had previously been relied on and noted, in addition, that the applicant’s chronic illness or his family situation did not warrant his release on humanitarian grounds. This decision was upheld by the Łódź Court of Appeal on 20 January 2004. Similarly, on 23 June 2004 the Łódź Regional Court dismissed a request by the applicant for the preventive measure in question to be lifted and decided to further extend his detention. Subsequently, the applicant’s detention was extended by decisions of the Łódź Regional Court of 20 October 2004 and 11 January and 28 February 2005. To justify the extension of the applicant’s detention the courts relied on the original grounds given. Moreover, the authorities noted that the proceedings could not be completed for objective reasons, such as the fact that samples of the victim’s nails, which were necessary to perform DNA tests, had been lost and that it was necessary to examine a few more witnesses. On 7 March 2005 the Łódź Regional Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to 15 years’ imprisonment. On 29 September 2005 the Łódź Court of Appeal upheld that judgment. On 28 June 2006 the Supreme Court dismissed a cassation appeal in the case. Throughout the entire proceedings the applicant was represented by legal counsel of his choice; initially by two attorneys and later, upon the remittal of the case, by one. The applicant was detained in Łódź Remand Centre on the following dates: - from 14 April to 20 June 2000; - from August 2000 to 23 August 2002; - from 10 December 2003 to 29 December 2004 and - from 25 January 2005 to 25 October 2006. Subsequently, the applicant was held in Bydgoszcz Fordon, Łódź and Garbalin Prisons. On 22 July 2010 the applicant was transferred to Wojkowice Prison, where he currently remains. The applicant submitted that Łódź Remand Centre was overcrowded and that the sanitary and hygienic conditions were inadequate. Initially, the applicant was held with four other detainees in a cell designed for three persons. Subsequently, he was transferred to a cell which measured 11.6 m² and was shared by five persons, including the applicant. The remand centre had not been renovated and was dirty. There was mould on the walls and the cells were infested with bugs. The furniture was scarce and shabby. In his correspondence with the Court, the applicant repeatedly submitted that unspecified persons had drugged him before his trials, subjected him to electric shocks and used various auditory and visual methods in order, in the applicant’s opinion, to force him to plead guilty to the crime he was charged with. Lastly, the applicant, who suffers from psoriasis and had been, in the past, treated for hepatitis C, asserted that throughout his detention in various penitentiary facilities he had not received adequate medical care and had not been able to follow the diet he had been prescribed by his doctor when he was at liberty. The applicant maintained that his health had significantly deteriorated since his arrest. He did not, however, specify what ailments he was currently suffering from and did not provide any medical records to support that submission. The applicant submitted that he had complained to the penitentiary authorities about different aspects of his detention but had never received any reply. The file contains a copy of a letter issued by an unspecified authority on 16 October 2007. It is confirmed in the letter that the applicant had lodged numerous complaints with the administration of Bydgoszcz Fordon Prison and Łódź Remand Centre. It is further explained that the applicant’s complaints that the authorities had subjected him to electric shocks and caused him to have auditory and visual hallucinations were considered manifestly ill-founded. A detailed description of the relevant domestic law and practice concerning general rules governing conditions of detention in Poland and domestic remedies available to detainees alleging that their conditions of detention are inadequate are set out in the Court’s pilot judgments given in the cases of Orchowski v. Poland (no. 17885/04) and Norbert Sikorski v. Poland (no. 17599/05) on 22 October 2009 (see §§ 75-85 and §§ 45-88 respectively). More recent developments are described in the decision given by the Court in the case of Łatak v. Poland (no. 52070/08) on 12 October 2010 (see §§ 25-54). The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of pretrial detention (tymczasowe aresztowanie), the grounds for its extension, release from detention and rules governing other, socalled “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze) are set out in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Gołek v. Poland, no. 31330/02, §§ 2733, 25 April 2006 and Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, §§ 2223, 4 August 2006.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
16,001-96055,ENG,POL,ADMISSIBILITY,2009,DARMON v. POLAND,4,Inadmissible,Giovanni Bonello;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Nebojša Vučinić;Nicolas Bratza;Päivi Hirvelä,"The applicant, Mr Marian Darmoń, is a Polish national who was born in 1947 and lives in Cracow. He was represented before the Court by Mr Z. Cichoń, a lawyer practising in Cracow. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. In December 1972 the applicant got married and on 18 May 1973 the applicant’s wife gave birth to a girl, J. The applicant did not try to rebut the legal presumption that he was J’s father. Subsequently, a second daughter was born of the applicant’s marriage. In 1984 the applicant divorced from his wife. The court awarded custody of the children to the applicant’s former wife and ordered the applicant to pay child maintenance for them. No doubts as to the applicant’s paternity were raised in the divorce proceedings. The applicant submitted that he had had doubts as to his paternity of his older daughter since the beginning of his marriage which had been reinforced during the divorce proceedings when his wife had admitted to infidelity. However, the applicant had neither brought an action denying paternity after the birth of J nor raised doubts as to his paternity in the divorce proceedings, considering that at the material time there had been no reliable scientific method of ascertaining that he was not the biological father of J. When DNA evidence had become possible in Poland and the applicant had decided to bring an action denying paternity, J had refused to undergo the test. On 24 November 2003 the applicant requested the Cracow District Prosecutor (Prokurator Rejonowy) to initiate civil proceedings by which he could deny his paternity of J. The applicant based his application on his personal conviction that J was not his daughter and on his suspicion that a certain Z.M. could be her biological father. On 5 April 2004 the applicant supplemented his application by submitting documents that had been requested by the prosecutor. Subsequently, the prosecutor obtained the case file of the applicant’s divorce proceedings from 1984 and heard testimonies from the applicant’s former wife. She denied having had an affair with Z.M., who had been her employer at the material time, and confirmed that the applicant was the father of her children. She also refused to submit to DNA testing. On three occasions in May and June 2004 the prosecutor attempted to hear evidence from the applicant, but he failed to reply to the summons. On 30 June 2004 the prosecutor sent him a letter refusing to initiate such proceedings. The prosecutor based that decision on the statements by the applicant’s former wife that the applicant was the biological father of J. As the applicant himself had failed to appear for interview with the prosecutor and his former wife had refused to undergo a DNA test, the prosecutor concluded that there was no evidence supporting the applicant’s request. The applicant contested this decision. On 27 July 2004 the Cracow Regional Prosecutor (Prokurator Okręgowy) informed him that he fully agreed with the findings of the District Prosecutor. On the same day the applicant appeared before the prosecutor without being summoned. On 16 November 2004 the Regional Prosecutor questioned the applicant and again dismissed his request to bring civil proceedings denying his paternity. The prosecutor considered that it was not possible to grant the applicant’s request solely on the basis of his statement. The prosecutor pointed to the fact that the applicant had not denied his paternity in the divorce proceedings twenty years ago and that his former wife had confirmed that he was the biological father of J. In those circumstances only genetic evidence could cast doubt on the presumption that the applicant was the father of J. Such a medical test could be ordered by the prosecutor; however, in the instant case it had not been possible given the lack of consent of all the parties involved, including his former wife. The applicant again contested the above decision. On 8 December 2004 the Cracow Appeals Prosecutor dismissed his complaint as groundless. Under Article 62 of the 1964 Family and Custody Code (Kodeks Rodzinny i Opiekunczy – “the Code”), if a child was born in wedlock there is a legal presumption that the mother’s husband is the father of her child. That presumption can be rebutted by bringing a civil action denying paternity (zaprzeczenie ojcostwa) (Article 62 § 3 of the Code). Under Article 63, an action denying paternity can be brought by the husband of the mother within six months of learning that his wife has given birth to a child. Finally, Article 86 of the Code provides that paternity may at any time be challenged by a prosecutor.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
17,001-114290,ENG,ROU,ADMISSIBILITY,2012,SASU v. ROMANIA,4,Inadmissible,Alvina Gyulumyan;Corneliu Bîrsan;Egbert Myjer;Ján Šikuta;Josep Casadevall;Kristina Pardalos;Luis López Guerra;Nona Tsotsoria,"1. The applicant, Mr Ioan Sasu, is a Romanian national, who was born in 1955 and lives in Arpaşul de Jos, Sibiu County. 2. The Romanian Government (“the Government”) are represented by their Agent, Ms Irina Cambrea, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. In a final decision of 11 November 1999 the Supreme Court of Justice convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to sixteen years’ imprisonment. 5. The applicant lodged several requests for revision of the final decision. They were all rejected by the courts on the grounds that the applicant had failed to bring evidence that would warrant the reopening of the proceedings and that no new facts or circumstances had been discovered that would have been unknown at the date when the final decision had been taken. 6. Two of those requests were dismissed by different panels of the Brasov Court of Appeal on 4 and 26 July 2007. 7. The applicant started serving his prison sentence on 17 September 1998. He remained in prison until 2 February 2010 when he was released conditionally. During his term of imprisonment, he was transferred sixty-eight times between eight prisons and three prison hospitals, as required by his state of health or a number of on-going court cases in which he was involved. 8. At the beginning of the detention period, it had been recorded that the applicant was suffering from lumbar lordosis (discopatie lombară) and psychopathy, the latter having been first diagnosed in 1976. The prison medical records indicate that he had received medical care and treatment for his condition. 9. During his detention, he was also diagnosed with heart disease, sick sinus syndrome and peripheral vascular disease. 10. On several occasions he was admitted to prison hospitals for treatment of heart disease and mental illness. He was also prescribed a special diet. 11. The applicant was held in Mărgineni Prison on several occasions from 27 September 2001 to 20 May 2003 and returned there on a number of occasions later in his sentence. He claimed that despite his mental illness he had had to work twelve hours a day in 2002 and 2003. During that time, because of overcrowding, two detainees had been sharing one bed. 12. On 3 October 2006 the applicant brought an action against two members of the commission that had given him permission to work, seeking damages under Articles 998-999 of the former Civil Code. On 16 May 2007 the Moreni District Court dismissed his action on the grounds that he had failed to prove a causal link between the two defendants and the alleged damage. On 15 January 2008 that decision was upheld on its merits by the Dâmboviţa County Court. The applicant’s subsequent appeal in cassation was declared null and void by the Ploieşti Court of Appeal in a final decision of 4 June 2008, as the applicant had failed to submit the reasons for his appeal within the time-limit. 13. According to information provided by the Prison Authority (Administraţia Penitenciarelor), the applicant was held in Aiud Prison eighteen times during his sentence, his detention there ranging from a few days to six or seven months at a time. After 2002 smoking was prohibited in all cells and there were designated areas for smoking. 14. On two occasions while detained in Aiud Prison, in February and September 2005, the applicant voluntarily took an overdose of medication. After detoxification, the doctors recommended psychiatric assistance at Jilava Prison Hospital. After each episode, the applicant was transferred – for one month the first time and nearly six months the second time – to Jilava Prison Hospital. 15. On 21 February 2007 the Sibiu District Court dismissed as ill-founded an action brought by the applicant against the prison governor and doctor concerning the conditions of his detention in Aiud Prison. He complained that he was being held with dangerous detainees and that he had not received adequate treatment for his psychiatric condition. He also complained that the governor had not assisted him in obtaining his pension file from Sibiu (a procedure described under point 7 below). 16. The court noted that the applicant’s placement in one cell or another had been determined by the prison’s internal regulations and had not been left to the discretion of the governor. It also noted that while the applicant’s mental illness entitled him to special detention conditions, it did not entitle him to privileges. Concerning the allegations of lack of medical treatment, the court noted that the applicant had received medication, and considered that the prison doctor was not responsible for the fact that the applicant had taken an overdose by swallowing all the pills at once. 17. The court also noted that the fact that the applicant did not enjoy the food he received was not imputable to either the governor or the doctor, in so far as the applicant could not prove that he had suffered any injurious consequences from his diet. 18. Lastly, the court noted that the applicant had applied to the Sibiu County Pensions Authority for an expert evaluation in order to have his pension rights established, and therefore concluded that neither the governor nor the doctor had committed any illegal acts that would render them responsible in this regard (nu există faptă ilicită). 19. The official prison records indicate that between 2006 and 2008 the applicant received nineteen envelopes with stamps for his correspondence. Five other similar requests were refused by the prison administration, either on the basis that the applicant had recently received a large number of envelopes or because he had had sufficient funds in his account to allow him to purchase the envelopes himself. He did not complain about those decisions. 20. On 18 August, 3 and 11 September 2007 and 12 May 2008 the applicant asked for permission to visit his sick mother, but his requests were dismissed by the prison board in charge. 21. It appears that the applicant did not lodge an appeal against the prison authorities’ decision with the courts under Ordinance no. 56/2003 or Law no. 275/2006 (see paragraph 37 below). 22. On 16 February 2007, while in detention in Aiud Prison, the applicant applied to the Alba County Court for temporary release from prison on the grounds that his family needed his help with farming. He argued before the court that he would return to prison given that if he were released, he could not afford the medical care he had received free of charge in prison. The court dismissed his application on 24 September 2007. The applicant did not appeal against the decision. 23. On 27 February 2007, the applicant informed the Court that he had problems with his dentition and alleged that the dental care he had received in prison was insufficient. 24. The applicant received dental care in Codlea Prison Hospital in 2007 and 2009. He had one tooth removed and another treated. 25. On 16 October 2008 a medical commission from Timişoara Prison (consisting of a dentist and an accountant) noted that the applicant had missing teeth and proposed a dental prosthesis plan, while nevertheless noting that “his dental problems were not significant”. The dentition model in the medical report shows that the applicant was missing four left and three right molars. The commission estimated the total cost of treatment at 749.92 Romanian lei (RON), of which 300 RON were payable by the applicant. Their estimate was based on Order No. 522/236 of 27 March 2008 issued by the Minister of Public Health together with the President of the National Health Insurance Authority (Casa Naţională a Asigurărilor de Sănătate). 26. The commission noted, however, that the applicant had no money available in his account and that Timişoara Prison lacked the facilities necessary to treat the applicant. 27. In 2004 the applicant lodged a complaint before the Avrig District Court against C.C. and others, the heirs of V.C., seeking damages of 69,000,000 old Romanian lei (ROL), representing the value of goods and cattle that he claimed he had lent to V.C. 28. On 9 February 2005 the District Court dismissed the action as time-barred. That decision was upheld by the Sibiu County Court. 29. In 2004 the applicant lodged another complaint against the heirs of V.C., seeking to compel them to pay interest on an alleged loan of 40,000,000 ROL that he had made to V.C. His action was dismissed in a final decision of 15 June 2005 by the Sibiu County Court on the grounds that the applicant had not proved that the initial loan was ever made. 30. On 12 October 2006 the applicant lodged an action against the Săcălaz local authorities, seeking restitution of two calves and a 250-kg pig, which had allegedly been confiscated from him by the communist authorities in 1988. He claimed that in 1990 the local authorities had informed him that they had returned the animals to V.C. 31. On 15 November 2006 the Timişoara District Court found that the applicant had failed to adduce any proof of his allegations and dismissed the action. By a final decision of 21 November 2008 the Timiş County Court declared his appeal null and void as he had not paid the relevant court fees. 32. In a decision of 26 June 1976 the authorities declared the applicant unfit for work due to a pre-existing condition that had worsened during his military service. 33. On an unspecified date during his detention the applicant requested that an invalidity pension be paid to him. 34. At the request of the Sibiu County Pension Authority (“the Pension Authority”) on 15 March 2006 the applicant underwent an expert evaluation by the Sibiu Work Capability Assessment Authority to determine his capacity for work (Cabinetul de expertiză medicală şi recuperare a capacităţii de muncă). The evaluation report confirmed the applicant’s invalidity and set 9 March 2007 as the date for review of his situation. 35. The Pensions Authority asked the National Institute for Work Capability assessment (Institutul Naţional de Expertiză Medicală şi Recuperare a Capacităţii de Muncă – “the National Institute”) to express its opinion on the expert report issued in March 2006. The National Institute confirmed the previous assessment, but added that the 1976 decision did not entitle the applicant to an invalidity pension. It therefore suggested that the Pensions Authority evaluate the applicant’s situation in the light of the Pensions Act (Law No. 19/2000). 36. On 22 May 2006 the Pensions Authority decided not to grant the applicant an invalidity pension, as he did not meet the requirements set forth in the Pensions Act. The decision was upheld by the Sibiu County Court on 19 September 2007 and by the Alba Iulia Court of Appeal in a final decision of 10 April 2008. 37. The domestic legislation on the execution of sentences, in particular Law no. 23/1969, Emergency Ordinance no. 56/2003 on the rights of prisoners (Ordinance no. 56/2003), and Law no. 275/2006 on the execution of sentences (Law no. 275/2006) are described in Petrea v. Romania (no. 4792/03, §§ 21-23, 29 April 2008). The situation as regards dental care in the Romanian prison system is described in V.D. v. Romania (no. 7078/02, §§ 73-79, 16 February 2010).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
18,001-57833,ENG,FRA,CHAMBER,1993,CASE OF MELIN v. FRANCE,3,No violation of Art. 6,R. Pekkanen,"7. Mr Pierre-André Melin, a French national, lives off private means and resides at Courbevoie (Hauts-de-Seine). He formerly practised as a lawyer. 8. On 6 May 1985 the Nanterre Criminal Court convicted him of fraud and sentenced him to a suspended term of sixteen months’ imprisonment, combined with an order (mise à l’épreuve) requiring him, inter alia, to compensate the victim for the damage which he had sustained. 9. The applicant appealed immediately to the Versailles Court of Appeal, which, giving judgment on 15 January 1986 in Mr Melin’s presence, upheld the lower court’s guilty verdict. On the other hand, it deferred pronouncement of sentence until 25 June 1986 as the accused had undertaken to reimburse the victim within six months if the court were to find him guilty. This aspect of the proceedings is not in issue. The typed text of the judgment was filed with the registry on the same day as its delivery. 10. Two days later Mr Melin lodged an appeal on points of law against the Court of Appeal’s judgment with the latter’s registry (Article 576 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). He stated that he reserved the right ""to put forward any other relevant ground once he had received the certified copy of the decision in question"". According to the applicant, he requested a copy of the judgment on the same occasion. A registry official allegedly took down his address and the case references, so as to be able to send him one in return for a forty franc fiscal stamp. The Government maintain that there were two possibilities: either the applicant had not requested a copy and could not therefore be surprised at not receiving one; or he had in fact asked for one, in which case a copy had undoubtedly been sent to him. 11. On 14 February 1986 the appeal file reached the registry of the Court of Cassation. Three and a half months later, on 27 May, the Criminal Division dismissed the appeal because no grounds had been put forward and because the contested judgment did not disclose any procedural defect. This decision was notified to Mr Melin on 18 June and recorded that the party seeking damages had submitted a memorial. 12. In a letter of 23 June to the President of the Criminal Division, the applicant explained that he had been unable to submit a memorial because he had not had available to him the text of the judgment of 15 January 1986; in addition he complained that the judge-rapporteur had failed to communicate to him a time-limit for the submission of a memorial. On 4 July the Chief Registrar replied to him that, as the judgment of the Court of Cassation was final, he could not appeal against it. 13. Throughout these various proceedings Mr Melin had conducted his own defence, though he had been assisted by a lawyer at first instance. 14. The main provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure referred to in this case are as follows: ""Every judgment shall include a statement of its reasons and an operative part. The operative part shall record the offences of which the accused have been found guilty or in respect of which they have been held liable, the sentence pronounced, the laws applied and the orders made with regard to civil claims. The judgment shall be read out by the president."" Amended by Law no. 85-1407 of 30 December 1985, which came into force on 1 February 1986, this provision is now worded as follows: ""Every judgment shall include a statement of its reasons and an operative part. The reasons shall constitute the basis of the decision. The operative part shall record the offences of which the accused have been found guilty or in respect of which they have been held liable, the sentence pronounced, the laws applied and the orders made with regard to civil claims. The judgment shall be read out by the president or by one of the judges; in so doing the president or judge may confine himself to the operative part ..."" ""... After it has been signed by the president and the registrar, the original copy shall be lodged with the court registry not later than three days after the delivery of the judgment. The fact that it has been so lodged shall be recorded in the register kept in the registry specifically for this purpose. ..."" According to the Court of Cassation’s case-law, failure to comply with the formalities laid down in Article 486 does not entail the nullity of the judgment in issue. Thus the belated lodging of the original copy of a judgment cannot render the judgment void where no prejudice has ensued for the applicant (Criminal Division, 27 November 1984, Bulletin criminel no. 370). ""The rules laid down for the criminal courts shall apply in the courts of appeal, subject to the provisions set out below."" ""Service of decisions, where such service is necessary, shall be effected at the request of the prosecuting authority or of the party claiming damages."" ""The prosecuting authority and all the parties shall have five clear days in which to appeal to the Court of Cassation after the delivery of the impugned judgment. ..."" ""An appellant on points of law may lodge a memorial, bearing his signature and setting out the grounds of his appeal, with the registry of the court from whose judgment he is appealing, either when he gives notice of appeal or within the following ten days. The registrar shall issue him with a receipt."" ""After expiry of this time-limit, a convicted appellant may transmit his memorial directly to the Court of Cassation; the other parties may not avail themselves of this provision without the services of a lawyer who is a member of the Court of Cassation Bar. ..."" ""Where one or more lawyers have been instructed, the judge- rapporteur shall set down a time-limit for the memorials to be filed with the registrar of the Criminal Division."" ""The memorials shall set out the grounds of appeal and cite the legal provisions whose violation is alleged. A fiscal stamp must be affixed, except where the appellant has been sentenced after conviction of a serious criminal offence (crime). They must be lodged within the prescribed time-limit. No additional pleading may be joined thereto after the judge- rapporteur has filed his report. If a memorial setting out additional grounds is lodged belatedly, it may be declared inadmissible."" ""In cases concerning any category of criminal offence, the Court of Cassation may give judgment on the appeal on points of law immediately after expiry of a period of ten days, which period begins to run on the date on which the Court of Cassation receives the file. ...""",[],[],[],['6'],[],[],0
19,001-23582,ENG,SWE,ADMISSIBILITY,2003,NIKKA v. SWEDEN,4,Inadmissible,Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant, Mr Aarno Nikka, is a Finnish national, who was born in 1957 and lives in Stockholm, Sweden. He is represented before the Court by Ms K. Koorti, a lawyer practising in Stockholm. The respondent Government were represented by Mrs E. Jagander, of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, as Agent. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The case concerns criminal proceedings brought against the applicant in relation to charges of assault and threats allegedly committed against his cohabitant, E., on 4 July 1996. The same day E. reported the incident to the police. According to E., the relationship between her and the applicant had deteriorated over a period of time. The applicant had also started to drink during the days preceding the incident. During the evening of 4 July 1996 E. began to pack her belongings because she had decided to leave the applicant. The applicant became aggressive and put his finger in her mouth. He then pulled her to the floor, injuring the back of her head and her shoulder. E further stated that the applicant slapped her in the face and threatened to kill her. The applicant admitted that they had quarrelled during the evening, but denied that he had assaulted or threatened E Instead, he alleged that E had fallen on the floor by accident. He also stated that he placed his hand over her mouth in order to prevent her from screaming. The applicant was charged with the offences of “assault” and “unlawful threat” against E, who also joined her claim for compensation to those proceedings. The applicant denied the charges at the hearing before the District Court trying the case, as well as civil liability to pay compensation, though he had already paid E certain sums totalling 7,210 Swedish kronor (SEK). E was heard before the court and maintained the statements she had made during the police investigation. The prosecutor also relied on a medical certificate and a photograph attesting to E’s injuries. In its judgment of 26 July 1996 the District Court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to two-months’ imprisonment, and made him liable to pay compensation to E, not to exceed the amount (SEK 7,210) already paid. The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal. The main hearing before the Court of Appeal was first scheduled to take place on 28 November 1996. On 20 November 1996, when an official of the Court of Appeal called the applicant at the apartment which used to be his and E’s home, E was present in the apartment and was informed of the date and place of the hearing. E was, however, not formally summoned to the hearing. In any event, E failed to appear at the main hearing on 28 November 1996 and the hearing was cancelled. The trial hearing was postponed until 29 April 1997. However, E. was not notified of the hearing and it was cancelled. The parties were invited to give their views on whether it was necessary to take evidence from her again or whether the audio-tape recording of her testimony in the District Court could be played back. Both the prosecutor and the applicant were of the opinion that it was essential to take evidence from her also in the Court of Appeal. 3 March 1998 was then fixed as the new date for the hearing and E was notified of the summons. However, as she failed to appear and her testimony was deemed necessary, the hearing was cancelled. E. was ordered to pay a fine of SEK 2,000 and it was decided that next time she should be brought to the hearing by the police. On 28 May 1998, as the attempt to fetch E. failed (she had not been notified of the hearing), the Court of Appeal cancelled the hearing since it was deemed necessary to take evidence from her. A new hearing was scheduled for 14 September 1998. The court ordered that E. be fetched and taken into custody a few hours in advance of the hearing in order to secure her attendance. Subsequently, a hearing scheduled for 14 September 1998 was cancelled as it had not been possible to fetch E. and her renewed testimony was considered necessary. A new hearing was scheduled for 30 September 1998. The Court of Appeal ordered once again that E was to be fetched and that she could be taken into custody prior to the transportation to the court. A sixth attempt to hold a hearing, on 30 September 1998, was also in vain since the police had failed to find E. The hearing was cancelled even though the prosecutor now claimed that E’s absence was no longer an impediment to holding a hearing. It was then decided to hold the hearing on 14 October 1998 and that the police should secure E’s attendance by fetching her and keeping her in custody a few hours before taking her to the court room. The Court of Appeal finally held the appeal hearing on 14 October 1998, in E’s absence, as the police had not been able to fetch her. Under the Code, Chapter 35 section 13, the Court decided to go ahead with the hearing since all legal possibilities to secure E’s attendance had been exhausted and impediments therefore existed to her giving testimony once more. The prosecutor invoked the audio-tape recording of her testimony previously given before the District Court. Defence counsel was of the view that E should be heard in person and that a new attempt to bring her to the Court of Appeal should therefore be made. However, counsel left it to the Court to decide whether E’s absence was an impediment to the holding of the hearing. The Court of Appeal heard the applicant and an audio-tape recording of E’s testimony to the District Court. The evidence also included four letters that E had addressed to the defence counsel, the public prosecutor and the Court of Appeal respectively on 8 August and 18 November 1996 and 10 March 1998. In her letter to defence counsel of 8 August 1996, which was only submitted by counsel to the Court of Appeal on 14 October 1998, E offered to take back all of what she had claimed previously against the applicant. She did not know how matters would evolve between them and thought that this was unimportant. In her view, the applicant had suffered enough by being detained on remand. She stated in addition that ""I know, as he does, what he has done to me"". E finally asked defence counsel to lodge an appeal against the District Court’s judgment and stated that she waived damages. In her letter to the prosecutor of 18 November 1996, E stated that she had made a big mistake, had lied about what had happened, that her motive had been revenge and that she retracted everything she had stated in court. Her letter addressed to defence counsel on the same date stated that her afore-mentioned letter to the prosecutor had not been worded in the right manner. When the event took place and the applicant ""took hold of her"", she had relived a rape that she had experienced as a girl. She had become very uncertain about what had actually occurred and thought that she might have mixed up the situations. In her letter of 10 March 1998 to the Court of Appeal, E explained that she had lacked the financial means to attend its hearing on 3 March 1998. In her view, the police report was incorrect and this she had pointed out during the previous trial. Moreover, she claimed not to remember events that took place two years earlier in her and the applicant’s apartment. In its judgment of 23 October 1998 the Court of Appeal upheld the District Court’s conviction and sentence of the applicant and, because of E’s statements, quashed the compensation order. It observed that the District Court had heard E extensively, for over an hour, and that the prosecutor, E’s counsel and the applicant’s counsel had asked her a large number of questions. The court went on to state: “....[E.] maintained during the hearing the information that she had first given to the police and she did not give any contradictory answers. Her testimony in the District Court was full of details and gives the impression that she is talking about something that she indeed experienced. [E] had been eager not to exaggerate what happened. She had also pointed out that [the applicant] had not been violent previously and she also tried to give an explanation as to why he had acted as he did on the occasion in question. There is nothing to indicate that [E] should have any reason to tell lies about [the applicant]. [E] has stated in one of her letters that she sought revenge against [the applicant]. Nevertheless, she did not state why. [The applicant] has declared that he thinks that she would like to seek revenge on the ground that he called her a whore and that the relationship was over. It does not appear very likely that [E] would give false information deliberately for that reason. As to the rest of the information given by [E] in the case, it is to be observed that her statements remained substantially the same, from her report to the police until her testimony before the District Court. Further, as regards the reliability of her statements, this must be considered as being strengthened by the medical certificate and the photograph. It appears unlikely that the injuries accounted for in the medical certificate had been caused by the course of events described by [the applicant]. The letters from [E] do not contain any information about what happened on the actual evening, but only the allegation that she had lied. In one of the letters she only stated that she had been uncertain about what had happened and that she could not remember the incident two years after. Her letters are vague and lacking in detail. In the light of these facts the court attaches no weight to [E’s] statements in the letters.” The applicant appealed to the Supreme Court. On 21 December 1998 the Supreme Court refused leave to appeal.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
20,001-23802,ENG,FIN,ADMISSIBILITY,2004,Y. v. FINLAND,4,Inadmissible,Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant, Y, born in 1965 and resident in Helsinki, is a Syrian citizen of Kurdish origin. He is represented before the Court by Mrs Nytte Ekman, resident in Kauniainen. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant and as they appear from the documents, may be summarised as follows. The applicant claims that he has been persecuted in his country of origin as follows: The applicant is a well-known writer and a poet in his home town Malikija, Syria. He has been subjected to persecution on grounds of his political opinion and ethnic background. He is a member of the Kurdish Democratic Party of Unity in Syria, Yekiti, which aims at guaranteeing human rights to the Kurdish people and at having their land returned to them. The applicant has produced anti-government material, such as posters and poems. In 1987 he was questioned by the Security Service for the first time, having recited his poems at a party. He was issued with a warning. On 5 October 1992 he was arrested as a suspect for anti-governmental activities. The arrest lasted 20 days during which the applicant was tortured; he was blindfolded, forced to sit in a car wheel and beaten with a weapon. He was set free in the absence of evidence on the alleged activities, but his friend is still detained. In April 1993 he was arrested again, having attended a secret conference arranged by the Union Party. The arrest lasted 29 days during which time he was denied sleep and got only a minimum amount of food. The above mentioned torture was repeated. The applicant’s brother was arrested at the same time. The applicant was told that his brother became ill while in detention and died, but he suspects that the brother, who was a district leader of the party, was killed. Since 1993 the applicant has been questioned many times and the Security Service has threatened that he will be killed or imprisoned, if he does not change his views and inform on his friends. The applicant claims that there is a warrant for his arrest in Syria and he fears that he will face at least five years’ imprisonment, if he returns to Syria. He argues that also the mere fact that he has sought asylum abroad will get him arrested. The applicant left Syria in 1993 and lived in Russia in 1993-1999. While pursuing studies in the Russian language in 1993-1994, he was politically active providing Radio Yerevan with his texts on the conditions in Syria. He is convinced that the Syrian Security Service is aware of his activities in Russia. The applicant returned to Syria in 1994 and faced similar problems as described above. The same year he returned to Russia. The applicant was able to enter Syria in 1999 and leave Damascus again in October 1999 since he paid the airport police 400 US dollars (USD). He travelled via Moscow to St. Petersburg and arrived in Finland on 25 April 2000. He applied for asylum the same day. He did not present any travel documents and he had only a copy of his Syrian passport on him. The applicant claims that he bought a false Russian passport in Russia for USD 2,000. He claims that he gave his Syrian passport to a fellow passenger on the bus to Finland, a Russian woman, who promised to send the passport to his girlfriend in St. Petersburg. The applicant kept only a copy of the passport. He promised to bring the original passport to the Finnish authorities as soon as his girlfriend returned it to him. The applicant’s application for asylum and a resident permit was refused by the Directorate of Immigration (ulkomaalaisvirasto, utlänningsverket) on 8 March 2002 and an order was issued for his removal to Syria. The Directorate of Immigration found, inter alia, that the applicant’s identity had not been established, that he had not presented any travel documents and that he had not submitted any medical certificates concerning the alleged assaults. During the questioning on arrival in Finland, the applicant did not allege that he was forced to flee to Russia in 1993. The applicant had not given account for his reasons for returning to Syria in 1999, although he claimed that there was a warrant for his arrest. The Directorate of Immigration found that it is not credible that a persecuted person, who had been issued an arrest warrant, would be allowed to leave the country. According to the applicant, he had not been arrested since 1993. Moreover, it was not credible that the Syrian authorities would take such an interest in someone who read his poems on the radio in Russia that there would be a warrant for his arrest. The mere fact that the applicant belonged to the Kurdish minority did not constitute a ground for granting him asylum. On 18 June 2003 the Administrative Court of Helsinki (hallinto-oikeus, förvaltningsdomstolen), having held an oral hearing, rejected the applicant’s appeal, finding that the story about his reasons for leaving Syria in 1999 was vague and superficial. It noted that he was able to visit Syria in 1994 and in 1999 and that he managed to leave the country in 1999 using his own passport. His activities in Russia and Finland, i.e. writing poems and texts about the Kurdish people’s situation, cannot be considered to be such that he would be in need of international protection. The Administrative Court found no evidence that the applicant would be considered an anti-government activist by the Syrian authorities. There were about 1.5 million Kurds in Syria and the mere fact that the applicant was a Kurd did not mean that he was in need of international protection. The court concluded that the applicant would not, on his return to Syria, face any individual risk of inhuman treatment. A request for application of Rule 39 was refused by this Court on 24 July 2003. According to written medical statements submitted by the applicant to the Supreme Administrative Court, the arches of his feet are low, his ankle joints are “loose”, his big toes are in a faulty position and his left calf does not strain normally. Moreover, his feet do not “roll” normally when walking. The physiotherapist considered that there was no contradiction between the applicant’s symptoms – pain in his feet and legs etc. – and the finding. Moreover, the applicant has undergone a discussion therapy but is still suffering from depression and anxiety. The applicant has also submitted a certificate issued on 27 May 2002 in Bad Salzuflen, Germany, by the Kurdish Democratic Party of Unity in Syria, Yekiti, according to which he is a member of the above-mentioned Party and that his life will be in danger if returned to Syria. The applicant has also submitted letters, apparently written by people who know him, according to which his life will be in danger if he returns to Syria, as he is a Kurd and as he has applied for asylum abroad. On 17 December 2003 the Supreme Administrative Court (korkein hallinto-oikeus, högsta förvaltningsdomstolen) refused the applicant leave to appeal against the Administrative Court’s decision. It is not known whether a date has been set for the applicant’s removal to Syria.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The first applicant was born in 1927 and lives in Derbent, Republic of Dagestan. The second applicant was born in1977 and lives in Severodvinsk, Arkhangelsk Region. 7. By a judgment of 20 December 1999 the Derbent Town Court of the Republic of Dagestan granted in part the applicant’s claim against the town administration, recognized that the State had unlawfully confiscated the house owned by his father and awarded him compensation in the amount of 8,349 Russian roubles (RUB). 8. On 2 February 2000 the Supreme Court of the Republic of Dagestan upheld that judgment on appeal, and on the same day the trial court forwarded the applicant a writ of execution. The trial court specified in the writ of execution that the debtor was the Commission for Restoration of the Rights of the Rehabilitated Victims of Political Repressions at the town administration. 9. The applicant did not take any further steps to recover the judicial award. As a result, the judgment of 20 December 1999 remains unenforced. 10. By a judgment of 19 July 2005 the Arkhangelsk Regional Court convicted the applicant of various crimes and sentenced him to imprisonment. That judgment was quashed by way of supervisory review on 11 April 2007 by the Presidium of the Arkhangelsk Regional Court (“the Presidium”). Having found that the lower courts had incorrectly assessed evidence in the case, the Presidium decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings against the applicant. 11. The applicant sued the State for damages. By a judgment of 20 March 2008 the Severodvinsk Town Court of the Arkhangelsk Region awarded the applicant compensation for unlawful detention in the amount of RUB 1,000. On 19 June 2008 the trial court issued a writ of execution and sent it to the applicant. The above judgment was upheld on appeal by the Arkhangelsk Regional Court on 2 October 2008. By a letter of 23 December 2008 the Legal Department of the Ministry of Finance informed the applicant of the domestic procedure to follow in order to recover the judicial award in his favour. 12.

22,001-99987,ENG,SWE,ADMISSIBILITY,2010,AL-ZAWATIA v. SWEDEN,4,Inadmissible,Alvina Gyulumyan;Elisabet Fura;Ineta Ziemele;Josep Casadevall;Luis López Guerra,"1. The applicant, Mr Adam Shafik Saied Al-Zawatia, is a stateless Palestinian who was born in 1973. He currently lives in Hässleholm in Sweden. He was represented before the Court by Ms S. Blomqvist, a lawyer practising in Osby. The Swedish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs Inger Kalmerborn, of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 3. On 9 December 2002 the applicant applied for asylum in Sweden. He was not in possession of any identity papers. He claimed that he came from Nablus on the West Bank and that his mother and sister still lived there. He invoked the general situation on the West Bank as his motive for seeking asylum. 4. Following a leading decision by the Director-General for Legal Affairs of the Migration Board (Migrationsverket) in which he considered that stateless Palestinians should be granted residence permits in Sweden on humanitarian grounds due to the serious situation in the region, on 30 October 2003 the Migration Board granted the applicant a temporary residence permit until 30 October 2004 to give him an opportunity to prove his identity. 5. Upon expiry of his temporary residence permit, the applicant applied for a permanent residence permit or, in the alternative, a prolongation of his temporary permit. Without submitting any kind of documentation, he maintained that he was from the West Bank, where he risked persecution by the authorities because, between 1994 and 1997, he had written some critical articles about corruption among high-ranking persons on the West Bank. On 8 November 2004 the Migration Board rejected the application. It noted that the applicant had failed to establish his identity and his place of residence before entering Sweden. A language analysis had shown that the applicant spoke an Arabic dialect spoken by persons originally from the West Bank but living in Jordan. Thus, although the applicant could originate from the West Bank, it was quite possible that he had lived in Jordan before leaving for Sweden. Accordingly, the Board found that the applicant could be deported to Jordan, Syria or the Lebanon. 6. The applicant appealed to the Aliens Appeals Board (Utlänningsnämnden) which, on 13 September 2005, upheld the Migration Board's decision not to grant the applicant a residence permit. It found, however, that the applicant should be deported to Jordan, and not alternatively to Syria or the Lebanon. This decision was final and the applicant was ordered to leave Sweden within two weeks. 7. Subsequently, on two occasions, the applicant requested the Migration Board to stay his deportation. On 14 February 2006 and again on 16 May 2006, the Board rejected these requests as it found that there were no impediments to the enforcement of the deportation order. 8. In September 2006 the applicant was apprehended in Germany and transferred back to Sweden in accordance with the Dublin Regulation. Upon his return to Sweden, in October 2006, he renewed his application for asylum and a residence permit in Sweden. He maintained that he was from the West Bank and invoked the situation there as his motive for seeking asylum. Moreover, he stated that he had a serious relationship with a Swedish woman with whom he had been living since June 2003 and that he had strong ties to Sweden. 9. On 15 May 2007 the Migration Board rejected the application. It first noted that the applicant had still not proved his identity but that it was probable that he was from the West Bank or Jordan. It then observed that he had invoked no grounds on which he could be considered as a refugee and that the general situation in the region was not so serious that he could be granted leave to remain in Sweden solely on that basis. Moreover, as concerned his relationship, the Board noted that the applicant could apply for a residence permit on that basis from his home country as prescribed by the Aliens Act. Lastly, it considered that the applicant had not been in Sweden legally for such a long time that he could be deemed to have a closer connection to Sweden than to his home country. The Board also noted that he had not invoked any health reasons. Thus, in conclusion, he could not be granted leave to remain in Sweden and he was to be deported to the West Bank. 10. The applicant appealed to the Migration Court (Migrationsdomstolen), maintaining his claims and repeating that he risked persecution by the authorities on the West Bank because, between 1994 and 1997, he had written some critical articles about corruption among highranking persons on the West Bank. These articles had been published in various newspapers on the West Bank and therefore the authorities in his home country were searching for him. He further stressed that he had a very good relationship with his girlfriend and that they were planning to get married. He also submitted that he felt depressed and had been in contact with a doctor for more than three years, and that accordingly it would be unreasonable to demand that he apply for a residence permit based on his relationship from his home country. Lastly, he alleged that he had no connections whatsoever to Jordan and that, therefore, any plans to deport him to that country should be ruled out. 11. On 9 November 2007, after having held an oral hearing, the Migration Court rejected the appeal. It first noted that the applicant had still not established his identity but that it was probable that he came from the West Bank. However, it could not be ruled out that he had lived in Jordan and the examination should therefore include both countries. The Migration Court then observed that the applicant had not been politically active in any way. Moreover, although he may have had written some critical articles in the period from 1994 to 1997 about corruption among high-ranking persons on the West Bank, he had been able to remain in the area for more than five years after the alleged articles were published without having encountered any problems. Thus, the Migration Court found it highly unlikely that he would risk persecution for having written those articles upon return. With regard to his relationship, the court considered that he could return to the West Bank to apply for a residence permit on this basis from there. The court further found that the applicant's health problems were not so serious that he could be granted leave to remain in Sweden on this ground.Sweden. 12. The applicant appealed to the Migration Court of Appeal (Migrationsöverdomstolen), maintaining his claims and adding that he and his girlfriend had married on 15 November 2007. His wife had two grownup children from a previous relationship. 13. On 10 January 2008, the Migration Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal. 14. On 4 March 2008 the Migration Board transferred the case to the Police Authority for enforcement of the deportation order to the West Bank, or alternatively to Jordan, should the former option not be possible for some reason. 15. Furthermore, on 31 March 2008, the Migration Board rejected a request from the applicant to re-open the proceedings on the basis of a medical certificate stating that the applicant suffered from depression and that there was a risk of suicide. The Board found that he had invoked no new circumstances of importance as all his claims had, in essence, already been examined. 16. In May 2008 the applicant lodged yet another request that the proceedings be re-opened. He claimed that he was in very poor mental health and had made several suicide attempts. He was receiving treatment for his mental problems which was beneficial for him. However, if the treatment was interrupted, there was a substantial risk that he would again try to commit suicide. Moreover, his wife, who was a nurse, gave him much care and support and it was unreasonable to demand that he apply for a residence permit on the basis of their relationship from his home country. He submitted a medical certificate confirming his very poor and unstable mental health. He also invoked a judgment, delivered on 7 May 2008, by the District Court (tingsrätten) in Hässleholm according to which the applicant had been convicted of illegal driving and aggravated drunken driving and sentenced to probation. It appeared from the judgment that he had tried to commit suicide by getting drunk and driving his wife's car into a road railing. 17. On 19 May 2008 the Migration Board decided to stay the enforcement of the applicant's deportation since it was uncertain whether it was medically possible for him to travel to his home country. 18. On 6 August 2008, the Board decided not to grant the applicant a residence permit in Sweden and lifted the stay of enforcement. It first noted that it had a very limited margin to take into account factors such as an asylum seeker's failed expectations, anxiety about returning to his or her home country and social and financial problems. Moreover, it was not the degree of severity of an illness that was decisive but whether the medical condition rendered the enforcement of a deportation order practically impossible. The Board then considered, on the basis of several medical certificates (see below), that the applicant's state of health was serious but that he remained at home and had declined to be committed to hospital for treatment as he considered that he could cope at home. Moreover, his problems emanated from his insecure situation and wish to remain in Sweden and not from a life-threatening illness. Thus, there were no practical impediments to the enforcement of the deportation order. No appeal lay against this decision. 19. According to medical certificates dated 5 July 2007, 13 March 2008, 29 April 2008 and 28 October 2008, written by Mrs Stål, psychiatrist in Hässleholm, the applicant had been a patient of hers since February 2004 due to depression and had been prescribed antidepressants (Remeron). During their meetings, the applicant had kept stating that he felt disappointed and badly treated by the various Swedish authorities as he had failed to find a job or get a residence permit. He had stated that he had been a successful businessman in the “Arab world” and wanted to get back into business. During his periods of depression, he had lost his appetite, had been unable to sleep and had been apathetic. He had become very depressed and suicidal because he considered his situation hopeless and himself worthless. Following a suicide attempt in August 2007 (when he had driven his wife's car into a road railing), the psychiatrist had prescribed stronger antidepressants (Efexor). His wife had been a great support to him, taking care of him and watching over him. 20. In another medical certificate, dated 25 June 2008, by Mr Appelquist, physician at the Psychiatric Clinic in Kristianstad, it was stated that the applicant had made an emergency visit that day to the clinic because of his depression. He had been apathetic and had suicidal thoughts due to his situation and his fear of being deported. 21. In two other medical certificates, dated 17 July 2008 and 23 October 2008, by Mr Wallin, chief physician at the Psychiatric Clinic in Hässleholm, it was stated that the applicant had visited him in July 2008 and again in October 2008. On both occasions, the applicant had been depressed, apathetic, very anxious and with constant suicidal thoughts. On the second occasion, he had also showed signs of paranoia. However, on both occasions, he had rejected an offer to be committed to a clinic for treatment as he had considered that he could cope at home even though, according to the chief physician, he had been close to being psychotic and almost eligible for being committed to compulsory psychiatric care. The chief physician concluded that, at that time, the applicant was not in a fit state to be deported. 22. On 10 February 2009 the Court decided to indicate to the Swedish Government under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court a suspension of his deportation to the West Bank or Jordan. 23. Consequently, on 11 February 2009 the Migration Court decided to stay until further notice the enforcement of its decision to expel the applicant. 24. The basic provisions mainly applicable in the present case, concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in Sweden, are laid down in the 2005 Aliens Act (Utlänningslagen, 2005:716 – hereafter referred to as “the 2005 Act”) which replaced, on 31 March 2006, the old Aliens Act (Utlänningslagen, 1989:529). Both the old Aliens Act and the 2005 Act define the conditions under which an alien can be deported or expelled from the country, as well as the procedures relating to the enforcement of such decisions. 25. Chapter 5, section 1, of the 2005 Act stipulates that an alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is, with certain exceptions, entitled to a residence permit in Sweden. According to Chapter 4, Section 1, of the 2005 Act, the term “refugee” refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race, nationality, religious or political beliefs, or on grounds of gender, sexual orientation or other membership of a particular social group and who is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country. This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities cannot be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals. By “an alien otherwise in need of protection” is meant, inter alia, a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well-founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment, or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Chapter 4, Section 2, of the 2005 Act). 26. Moreover, if a residence permit cannot be granted on the above grounds, such a permit may be issued to an alien if, after an overall assessment of his or her situation, there are such particularly distressing circumstances (synnerligen ömmande omständigheter) to allow him or her to remain in Sweden (Chapter 5, section 6, of the 2005 Act). During this assessment, special consideration should be given to, inter alia, the alien's health status. In the preparatory works to this provision (Government Bill 2004/05:170, pp. 190-191), life-threatening physical or mental illness for which no treatment can be given in the alien's home country could constitute a reason for the grant of a residence permit. 27. Under certain conditions, an alien may be granted a residence permit even if a deportation or expulsion order has gained legal force. This applies, under Chapter 12, Section 18, of the 2005 Act, where new circumstances have emerged that mean there are reasonable grounds for believing, inter alia, that enforcement would put the alien in danger of being subjected to capital or corporal punishment, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or there are medical or other special reasons why the order should not be enforced. If a residence permit cannot be granted under this provision, the Migration Board may instead decide to re-examine the matter. Such a re-examination shall be carried out where it may be assumed, on the basis of new circumstances invoked by the alien, that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in Chapter 12, Sections 1 and 2, of the 2005 Act, and these circumstances could not have been invoked previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not doing so. Should the applicable conditions not be met, the Migration Board shall decide not to grant a re-examination (Chapter 12, Section 19, of the 2005 Act). 28. Under the 2005 Act, matters concerning the right of aliens to enter and remain in Sweden are dealt with by three instances; the Migration Board, the Migration Court and the Migration Court of Appeal (Chapter 14, Section 3, and Chapter 16, Section 9, of the 2005 Act). Hence, upon entry into force on 31 March 2006 of the 2005 Act, the Aliens Appeals Board ceased to exist. 29. Where a rejected asylum seeker suffers from ill-health the enforcement of the deportation will occur only if the authority responsible for the deportation deems that the medical condition of the individual so permits. In executing the deportation, the authority in question is also able to ensure that the measures taken will be appropriate with regard to the circumstances of the particular case. For instance, if considered necessary, a special aeroplane can be chartered for the journey and arrangements can be made for medical staff and any necessary equipment to be available on board during the flight. On condition that the individual concerned consents to such measures being taken, arrangements can also be made for his or her assistance in the country of origin upon return. For example, medical records and other medical documentation can be sent in advance so that proper care can be prepared and arrangements be made for the individual to be met and taken care of by medical staff upon arrival. 30. Should an enforcement of an expulsion order lead to serious psychological health problems necessitating treatment in compulsory psychiatric care, the expulsion cannot, under any circumstances, take place without the approval of the chief physician responsible for the care (see, Section 29 of the Act on Compulsory Mental Care (lagen om psykiatrisk tvångsvård, 1991:1128). 31. The provisions on family reunification relating to a spouse, registered partner or cohabiting partner etc. of a person who is resident in Sweden are set out in Chapter 5, Section 3, of the Aliens Act and were given their present wording on 30 April 2006 in connection with the implementation of the E C Directive on the right to family reunification (Directive 2003/86/EC of 22 September 2003, hereinafter ""the Family Reunification Directive""). 32. Under Chapter 5, Section 3, first paragraph of the Act, unless otherwise provided in Sections 17-17b, a residence permit shall be granted to an alien who is a spouse or cohabiting partner of someone who is resident in Sweden or who has been granted a residence permit to settle in Sweden. The provisions hence provide for a right to obtain a residence permit unless there are special grounds against granting a residence permit. An alien who wants a residence permit in Sweden on account of family ties must have applied for and been granted such a permit before entering the country (Chapter 5, Section 18, of the Act. This rule was also stipulated in the 1989 Aliens Act). An application for a residence permit may not, as a general rule, be approved after entry. However, exemptions from this rule can be made for example if the alien has strong ties to a person who is resident in Sweden and it cannot reasonably be required that he or she travel to another country to submit an application there (Chapter 5, Section 18, second paragraph, point 5). An exemption may also be made if there are some other exceptional grounds (Chapter 5, Section 18, second paragraph, point 6). The requirement that, in principle, residence permits for family members have to be granted before entry into Sweden was introduced as one of a number of measures aimed at reducing the possibilities of obtaining a residence permit by means of marriages or relationships of convenience. Subsequently, the Swedish Government and Parliament have underlined on several occasions that the requirement that residence permits be obtained before entry into Sweden is an important part of measures to maintain regulated immigration. Moreover, the preparatory works to the Aliens Act state that it is important that aliens staying in Sweden illegally do not enjoy a better position than those who comply with decisions by the authorities to return to their country of origin in order to apply for a permit from there (Government Bill 1999/2000:43). The same requirement is found in Chapter III, Article 5, point 3 of the Family Reunification Directive, by which most European Union countries are bound. Many European countries hence require that a residence permit on account of family ties be granted before entry into the country. The Directive has been incorporated into Swedish law (Government Bill 2005/06:72). 33. As regards the exemptions that can be made according to Chapter 5, Section 18, second paragraph, point 5 of the Aliens Act, the preparatory works to the provision (Government Bill 1999/2000:43, p. 55 et seq.) state that the main emphasis should be placed on the question of whether it is reasonable to require that the alien return to another country in order to submit an application there. Relevant elements, which may be favourable for the alien, may be whether he or she can be expected, after returning home, to encounter difficulties in obtaining a passport or exit permit and this is due to some form of harassment on the part of the authorities in the country of origin. It may also be whether the alien will be required to complete a long period of national service or service under unusually severe conditions. It may also be relevant whether the alien has to return to a country where there is no Swedish foreign representation and where major practical difficulties and considerable costs are associated with travelling to a neighbouring country to submit the application there. Relevant elements, which may count against the alien, may be that he or she is staying in the country illegally, that their identity is unclear or if there are strong ties to the country of origin. 34. According to information from the Swedish Consulate-General in Jerusalem, its average processing time for investigating cases concerning ties to Sweden is from one week to two months depending on where the applicant is living. In the event that the applicant is not able to come to Jerusalem, staff from the Consulate-General can go to the West Bank and conduct the interview at the Representative Office of Denmark in Ramallah. According to information from the Consulate-General, people living in Nablus and other towns on the West Bank are generally able to go to Ramallah for an interview. If instead the applicant is deported to Jordan, he can apply for family reunification at the Swedish Embassy in Amman, where processing time for investigating a case concerning ties to Sweden is less than one month. Furthermore, the Swedish Migration Board has stated that the total average processing time in such cases from the filing of an application at a Swedish representation abroad to the Migration Board's decision is a little more than five months. A decision from the Migration Board may be appealed against to the Migration Court and the Migration Appeal Court. 35. The UK Border Agency, Country of Origin Information Report on the Occupied Palestinian Territories from 6 August 2009 stated in so far as relevant: 8.01 The situation in Gaza remained tense with continuing strain on the Israeli/Hamas cease fire ... 8.03 In its Weekly Report: On Israeli Human Rights Violations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory dated 27 May 2009; the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) stated that: “...Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) have continued to impose severe restrictions on the movement of Palestinian civilians throughout the West Bank, including occupied East Jerusalem. Thousands of Palestinian civilians from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip continue to be denied access to Jerusalem.” 36. According to a report from the UK Home Office (Operational Guidance Note, Israel, Gaza and the West Bank, February 2009; hereinafter ""OGN Feb 09""), the Israeli Health Ministry reported in May 2008 that Israel is providing ambulatory, outpatient and inpatient services to Palestinian patients who access care in the Palestinian Authority (PA) hospitals, at the request of the Palestinian Ministry of Health. At times these services are provided in conjunction with Israeli and international NGOs. Israel also provides public health laboratory services, as well as providing training programmes to Palestinian physicians, nurses and other health professionals. Furthermore, in 2007 over 15,000 permits were granted to Palestinian patients and their companions to receive treatment in Israel. In addition to the public health services available and those provided by charitable and voluntary organisations, the Palestinian population is provided with health care by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society and other Palestinian non-governmental organisations and by UNWRA. As regards the availability of mental health care, the following may be noted. There is one psychiatric hospital on the West Bank with 320 beds as well as two general hospitals with psychiatric units in Nablus and Tulkarm with 4 inpatient beds. 37. The health care system in Jordan is considered to be good. According to United Nations Development Programme, 98.5% of the inhabitants have access to public health care, although principally primary health care (see for example the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs report on the Situation of Human Rights in Jordan, 2007, p, 11). About half of the inhabitants of Jordan are originally Palestinians, the great majority of whom now have Jordanian citizenship, which means that they have the same rights and obligations as the “Transjordans” (ibid. pp. 16-17). The International Medical Corps (IMC) confirms that Jordan has one of the best health care systems in the region, However the IMC further notes that Jordan's resources are strained by a massive refugee population (about 60% of its 5.7 million citizens are Palestinian or of Palestinian descent) and that the needs of destitute Iraqis put a large burden on the country's resources. The IMC further states that Iraqis and their Jordanian host population suffer from limited access to medical care, especially secondary and mental health care services. However, to address the needs of the Iraqi refugees and other vulnerable populations in Jordan, the IMC is implementing assistance programmes that aim to improve the quality of primary health care, including mental health services (see information at the IMC web site; http://www.imcworldwide.org.uk/wherewework.asp?pageid=69. As regards the availability of mental health care in Jordan, it should be noted that there are 3 to 5 clinical psychologists, 24 psychiatrists (plus 12 working for the army) and a few counsellors available in Jordan. Psychosocial services offer a total of 450 beds and 30 outpatient clinics (see IOM, “Assessment on Psychosocial Needs of Iraqis Displaced in Jordan and Lebanon”, 2008-04-23, p, 12). Jordan's public health care system is state-subsidised, but the public health care system is overburdened and provides only basic care. Many Jordanian citizens are enrolled in a national health insurance programme not open to foreigners, who must rely on private insurance to cover health care costs. Private insurance is expensive and frequently excludes costly treatment and surgical operations. According to the Jordanian authorities, Iraqi refugees can benefit from emergency health care regardless of their legal status. However, to receive further treatment in public hospitals they need to be residents. For this reason the majority of Iraqis rely on private hospitals whenever they can afford to pay. The IOM report primarily concerns the possibilities for Iraqi refugees in Jordan to obtain mental health care. It may be assumed that the information it contains has a bearing also on the availability of mental health care for Palestinians living in Jordan who are not Jordanian citizens.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

Currently, he is detained at Szeged Prison. On 16 June 2003 the Austrian Vienna Court of Appeal finally convicted the applicant, a Hungarian citizen, of two counts of aggravated murder and robbery for having strangled and robbed two of his homosexual partners. It sentenced him to life imprisonment, with the earliest release on parole after 15 years, and to a ban from Austrian territory. The ban entailed that the applicant could involuntarily be transferred to Hungary for the execution of his sentence. On 8 June 2006 the applicant was surrendered by the Austrian authorities to their Hungarian counterpart. On 26 January 2006 the Hungarian Budapest Regional Court established that the legal conditions for executing the sentence in a Hungarian prison were indeed met. On 26 July 2006 it converted the applicant’s sentence into life imprisonment under Hungarian law, with the earliest release on parole after 30 years.

24,001-5188,ENG,BGR,ADMISSIBILITY,2000,O.N. v. BULGARIA,4,Inadmissible,Matti Pellonpää,"The applicant is a Bulgarian national, born in 1957 and living in Vratsa. A. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 1. Background On 8 April 1975 the applicant was adopted by Mrs F. Under a contract concluded on 30 April 1975 the applicant undertook to provide daily care for Mrs F. and for her ill sister until the end of their lives and to pay 3,800 levs, in exchange of Mrs F.'s undertaking to transfer the ownership of her apartment to the applicant. The applicant paid 3,800 levs and discharged his care obligations properly until the end of 1981 when his relations with Mrs F. deteriorated. Since 1981 the applicant and Mrs F. have been parties to several civil proceedings such as proceedings for annulment of the adoption, for enforcement and for rescinding of their 1975 contract and for payment of compensation. A judgment of 12 March 1986 established that the 1975 contract was to be considered rescinded. 2. The proceedings between 1987 and 1992 On 12 January 1987 the applicant brought an action before the Vratsa Regional Court (Окръжен съд) against Mrs F. and two other persons seeking, inter alia, restitution of the 3,800 levs paid and of the value of the care and services furnished by him under the 1975 contract. His action was based on the rule of prohibition of unjust enrichment (неоснователно обогатяване) as enshrined in Section 55 of the Law on Obligations and Contracts (Закон за задълженията и договорите). The court heard numerous witnesses and experts who established the services performed by the applicant and their value. The court held its last hearing on 15 September 1989 and announced that the judgment would be delivered soon thereafter. In 1991 the applicant twice addressed the court asking for a speedy delivery of the judgment. In February and June 1991 he also sought to amend his claim arguing that the sharp increase in inflation since 1989 had led to seven fold devaluation of the real value of the Bulgarian currency.  The judgment, which was dated 15 January 1991, was delivered on 8 July 1991. The court found that the applicant was entitled to restitution of all that he had given under the 1975 contract. This right had arisen on 12 March 1986, the date on which the judicial decision confirming the rescission of the 1975 contract had been delivered. It was further established that the services performed by the applicant and the food, heating fuel and other products provided by him to Mrs F. and her sister for the period 1975 - 1981 amounted to 14,442.65 levs (the 3,800 levs paid by the applicant included), according to prices from the relevant period. The court therefore awarded to the applicant this amount, together with the established interest rate (законна лихва), to be counted as from 12 January 1987, the date of bringing of the applicant's action.  The parties appealed to the Supreme Court (Βърховен съд) which on 31 January 1992 quashed the Regional Court's judgment under Section 208 § 3(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure (Граждански процесуален кодекс) and returned the case for renewed examination as there had been certain procedural irregularities. The Supreme Court was composed of three justices, Mr Shivachev, Mr Belchev and Mrs Krasteva. 3. The proceedings before the Montana Regional Court The referred case was taken by the Montana Regional Court as there was not a sufficient number of judges at the Vratsa Regional Court. The Montana Regional Court held 13 hearings. At most of the hearings witnesses and experts were heard, evidence was admitted and oral submissions were made. At the first hearing on 13 July 1992 the applicant stated the evidence on which he would rely. He later decided to request the appointment of an expert and submitted a motion in writing on 24 August 1992. The court granted the request by decision of 9 September 1992. On 25 September 1992 the expert's report was submitted to the court. The hearing listed for 5 October 1992 was adjourned as there was no confirmation that one of the defendants had received the summons. On 15 October 1992 and 23 November 1992 the applicant made submissions in writing amending his claim to reflect the inflation and requested the appointment of another expert. On 24 November 1992 the request was granted. On 14 December 1992 the proceedings were suspended due to the death of one of the defendants. The applicant was instructed to state whether he wished to pursue the action against the heirs and to provide their names and addresses. He did so on 18 January 1993. On 15 February 1993 the expert appointed by the court filed his report. The fourth hearing took place on 22 March 1993. Both parties requested leave to submit further evidence and to question witnesses. The applicant requested additional reports from the experts. The hearing was adjourned. On 17 May 1993 the court held a hearing. One of the experts and one of the witnesses for the applicant did not appear. The court decided to hold another hearing. On 2 June 1993 the applicant requested in writing that additional questions be put to the experts. Their answers were filed with the court on 29 June 1993. On 5 July 1993 the court held a hearing. An expert did not appear. The case was listed for a further hearing. By written motion of 20 August 1993 the applicant increased the amount of the claim in view of the inflation and requested leave to question three additional witnesses. The next hearing was on 20 September 1993. The applicant sought leave to put additional questions to one of the experts and requested an adjournment as one of his witnesses had not been able to attend. On 12 October 1993 the applicant requested in writing leave to have another witness examined. On 19 October 1993 an additional expert's report was filed. The hearing on 25 October 1993 was adjourned upon the request of the applicant who insisted on the questioning of a witness who had not appeared. On 25 October and 1 November 1993 the court rejected the applicant's request for additional questions to one of the experts. On 17 November 1993 the applicant requested in writing leave to have re-examined a witness who had already been questioned. At the hearing on 29 November 1993, the ninth hearing in the case, one of the witnesses was unable to attend. An expert's opinion which was due had not been filed. The court listed the case for a further hearing. On 16 March 1994 the applicant made submissions in writing requesting further reports from the experts. This request was rejected. The failure of a witness and of an expert to appear at the tenth hearing, which was held on 4 April 1994, prevented the conclusion of the proceedings. On 19 April 1994 the applicant requested in writing leave to have two additional witnesses summoned and examined. The request was granted. In the course of the eleventh hearing, on 9 May 1994, the applicant sought to increase the amount of the claim in view of the inflation. The case was adjourned as one of the defendants had not appeared and the relevant law required that all defendants be provided with an opportunity to comment on any amendment of the claim. On 21 May 1994 the applicant successfully requested the court to order an additional expert's opinion. This was filed on 3 June 1994. The hearing on 13 June 1994 could not conclude the proceedings for the same reasons as those, which caused the adjournment of the hearing of 9 May 1994. On 20 June 1994 the applicant requested the further questioning of two witnesses. This was granted. The last hearing before the Regional Court took place on 12 September 1994. Following all amendments of the amount of the claim, it was finally set by the applicant at 595,365.55 levs as he insisted that the price levels of 1994 should be used. On 27 September 1994 the Regional Court delivered its judgment. It found that the applicant's right to restitution of what he had given under the 1975 contract had arisen on 12 March 1986. The court awarded to the applicant 15,036.33 levs, together with the established interest rate, to be counted as from 12 January 1987, the date of the submission of the applicant's action. Addressing the applicant's argument that the inflation should be taken into account the court found, inter alia: ""... upon the rescission of a contract the parties are under the obligation to return whatever they have exchanged in order to restore the situation as it was prior to the execution of the contract. Therefore, the Court finds that the claim is well-founded for its part up to 15,036.33 levs ... and should be dismissed as ill-founded in its remaining part."" 4. Appeal and review (cassation) proceedings The applicant and the defendants appealed to the Supreme Court. On 3 January 1995 the applicant requested in writing a speedy examination of the case. The appeal was examined by a chamber of the Court, which was composed of three justices, two of whom, Mrs Krasteva and Mr Belchev, had also participated in the examination of the case in 1992. The applicant did not request their removal. The Supreme Court heard the appeals on 17 February 1995. On 7 March 1995 the Supreme Court dismissed the appeals. According to the Code of Civil Procedure the award of 15,036.33 levs plus interest became enforceable on the same date. The Supreme Court found inter alia: ""The [Regional] Court correctly awarded restitution of the benefits on the basis of their value as of the moment of their bestowal, as this is the amount with which the [applicant] has actually become poorer. If the pecuniary equivalent of the furnished services were to be awarded under up-to-date prices, the [applicant] would have received more than that of which he was actually deprived. [In cases] of unjust enrichment the benefits bestowed are to be restituted up to the amount of the deprivation suffered."" In May 1995 the applicant and the defendants submitted to a five-member chamber of the Supreme Court petitions for review (cassation) (преглед по реда на надзора) against the judgments of 27 September 1994 and 7 March 1995. A hearing was listed for 16 November 1995. It was adjourned until 18 January 1996 upon the applicant's request in view of the unavailability of his legal representative. The hearing on 18 January 1996 was adjourned as the defendants had not been properly summoned. The hearing eventually took place on 7 March 1996. On 10 June 1996 the Supreme Court, sitting in a five-member chamber, dismissed the applicant's petition for review The Court confirmed that according to the relevant law the applicant could not claim re-evaluation according to up-to-date prices. Also, dealing with the applicant's complaint that the same justices decided twice in his case, the court stated inter alia: ""... the examination of the [second appeal] by the same chamber which had previously quashed the lower court's judgment and had returned the case to it under Section 208 § 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure not only is not a breach of procedure, but is desirable in view of the [chamber's] cognizance of the matter and the [need for] economy ... The grounds under Section 208 § 3 for returning a case to the first instance court are such that the [appellate] court does not decide on the merits."" On 30 July 1996 the defendants paid to the applicant the amount of 68,676 levs, which represented the principal sum due plus interest. B. Relevant domestic law and practice The relevant provisions of the Law on Obligations and Contracts read as follows: Section 55 ""Anyone who has received something without a causa or pursuant to a causa which has not realised or has ceased to exist, shall be under the obligation to return it..."" Section 57 § 2: ""If the object to be restituted has been ... consumed by the beneficiary when he already knew that he possessed it without causa, the latter owes its real value ... However, if the object [to be restituted] has been ... consumed by the beneficiary before the invitation [to return it] the latter owes only that of which he has benefited ..."" According to the practice of the Supreme Court (реш. No.65 от 8.12.1981г. на ОСГК на ΒС по гр.д. No. 30/81): ""The consequence of the rescission of a bilateral contract is that the parties shall return whatever they have exchanged in order to restore the situation as it was prior to the execution of the contract. The restitution is due because the contract which had been the legal ground of the exchange has ceased to exist. The restitution ... is due under Section 55 § 1 of the Law on Obligations and Contracts..."" The statutory default interest rate applicable to judicial awards is established by acts of the Council of Ministers (Министерски съвет). It was 6 percent per annum between 1987 and mid-1991 and was, thereafter and during the relevant period of time, equal to the basic interest rate, as established by the Bulgarian National Bank, increased by three points. At different periods of time between 1991 and 7 March 1995, when the judgment awarding 15,036.33 levs to the applicant became enforceable, the interest rate thus varied between 15 and 60 percent per annum. Section 208 § 3(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that the appellate court has to refer the case back for renewed examination by the lower court where the latter's judgment has been quashed because of a violation of the party's right to fully participate in the proceedings.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
25,001-23598,ENG,FIN,ADMISSIBILITY,2003,PURSIHEIMO v. FINLAND,2,Inadmissible,Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant, Matti Pursiheimo, is a Finnish national, who was born in 1946 and lives in Rauma. He is represented before the Court by Mr Pekka Lankinen, a lawyer in Tampere. The respondent Government are represented by their Agent, Mr Arto Kosonen, Director in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. In December 1997 as well as in January and June 1998 the applicant was apprehended by the police in his home after having disturbed his wife and grown-up daughter in a drunken state. On 4 September 1998 the Rauma police authority revoked his licences to keep nine rifles and four pistols and seized them. The decision was based on section 67, subsection 2 (4), of the 1998 Firearms Act (ampuma-aselaki, skjutvapenlag 1/1998) which had entered into force on 1 March 1998. On the strength of this provision a licence may be withdrawn due to the holder’s state of health or dangerous lifestyle or behaviour such that it endangers the safety of himself and others and renders him unsuitable to possess guns, ammunition or related parts. The reason indicated in the decision was, in extenso, “the applicant’s repeated, disturbing behaviour while drunk”. The applicant appealed, requesting an oral hearing of himself as well as his wife and daughter so as to prove that there was no causal link between his being drunk and the purported risk that he might use the firearms while under the influence of alcohol. His heavy alcohol consumption had been due largely to conflicts between himself and his daughter, who had moved away from home after the incidents leading to his apprehension. He had never assaulted her or anyone else and had never touched the firearms while drunk. The firearms had furthermore been locked. He further denied abusing alcohol continuously such that his behaviour met the condition in the Firearms Act for withdrawing his licences. That law required, in addition, that his behaviour was so problematic as to engender a risk that he might use his firearms for other than permissible purposes. The police authority’s position that he was an alcohol abuser had not been backed up by any medical evidence. The revocation and seizure order had come as a surprise as he had not been warned that this might be the consequence of the behaviour which had led to his apprehension for drunkenness. Some of the firearms had been inherited by the applicant and had been in the family for three generations. In its decision of 23 March 1999 the County Administrative Court (lääninoikeus, länsrätten) of Turku and Pori refused the request for an oral hearing, considering that the applicant “had accepted the basis” for the revocation and seizure order, i.e. that he had behaved in a disturbing manner while drunk. Even though it had been contended that he had never been violent, in the circumstances at hand and given “the other information emanating from the documents”, it was manifestly unnecessary to hold a hearing, whether for the purpose of examining whether the legal conditions for the order had been met or for any other reason. The court went on to uphold the revocation and seizure order, noting that it had been based on the applicant’s “repeated, disturbing behaviour while drunk”. The court recognised that no attempt had been made to establish whether he had acted violently but noted that the order had been based not on his violence but on his alcohol abuse which in itself could be considered a lifestyle endangering the safety of others and thus warranting a withdrawal of his licences. In its decision of 31 December 1999 the Supreme Administrative Court (korkein hallinto-oikeus, högsta förvaltningsdomstolen), by three votes to two, dismissed the applicant’s complaint about the lack of an oral hearing before the County Administrative Court. It also refused his request for an oral hearing before the Supreme Administrative Court. The highest court, like the lower court, noted that the applicant had accepted the basis of the decision made by the police, namely his alcohol problem and disturbing behaviour, adding that he had been apprehended in his home in December 1997 as well as in January and in June 1998. In view of this and “other information emanating from the documents” a hearing was unnecessary. The Supreme Administrative Court also upheld the revocation and seizure order, essentially relying on the lower court’s reasons. The justices in the minority would have remitted the case for an oral hearing before the lower court. They considered that the evidence which the applicant had wished to present as to the effect of his use of alcohol on his suitability to possess guns concerned a fact of relevance to the assessment of whether the legal conditions for the revocation of his licences were met. Considering also the importance of the licences for him, it was not “manifestly unnecessary” to hold an oral hearing. Under section 67, subsection 2 of the Firearms Act a licence for the acquisition or possession of a firearm, firearm component, cartridges and specially dangerous projectiles may be revoked if, inter alia, the licence holder is to be deemed unsuitable to acquire or possess such objects, given that due to his state of health or his way of life or his behaviour he is endangering his own safety or that of others. According to the Government Bill (no. 183/1997) for the enactment of the Firearms Act, a licence could for example be revoked for reasons relating to the licence-holder’s health, way of life or behaviour. Before a licence can be revoked for reasons relating to the licence-holder’s way of life or behaviour, this way of life or behaviour should endanger the licence-holder’s own safety or that of others. Continued abuse of intoxicants – alcohol or drugs – may be considered such a way of life endangering safety as gives reason to revoke the licence. Thus, the danger caused thereby would not necessarily have to be related to firearms but even violent, dangerous or threatening behaviour without use of guns could constitute a ground for revoking the licence. However, in cases where the licence-holder’s way of life was considered problematic to the extent that there was a risk of misuse of guns, it would always be necessary to revoke the licence. The revocation should nonetheless take account of all particular circumstances, the decisive matter being to what extent the act or conduct in question impacts on the license holder’s suitability to handle firearms. In its decision no. 1998:16 the Supreme Administrative Court found that a case concerning the revocation of a licence to possess firearms involved no right or obligation within the meaning of section 16, subsection 1 (969/1995) of the Constitution (perustuslaki, grundlagen) or Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The case concerned a prohibition to appeal against a decision under section 1 of the former Act on Firearms and Ammunition (33/1933) and sections 24 and 19 of the Decree on Firearms and Ammunition. Under those provisions, the police had the right to revoke a licence to possess firearms if it was found necessary. The Supreme Administrative Court voted on the case (5-3). According to the dissenting members of the Court, the revocation of a firearms licence involved the determination of a “right” or “obligation” within the meaning of section 16, subsection 1, of the Constitution. Under section 38 of the Act on Administrative Court Procedure (hallintolainkäyttölaki, förvaltningsprocesslag 586/1996), in its then form, the applicant was in principle entitled to a hearing once he had requested one, but this request could be refused if a hearing would have been manifestly unnecessary in light of the subject-matter or for any other reason. Under the Firearms Act the applicant was entitled to designate or accept someone else as the owner of his firearms provided that person had been granted the requisite licence to that end. There is no indication that the applicant availed himself of this right within the prescribed three months (possibly extended to six) or whether the firearms were sold at a public auction the yield of which was to be passed onto the applicant following a deduction of administrative costs. Any firearms that could not be sold were automatically transferred into State ownership without any compensation (sections 99-100).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
26,001-82155,ENG,FRA,ADMISSIBILITY,2006,COOPERATIVE DES AGRICULTEURS DE MAYENNE AND COOPERATIVE LAITIÈRE MAINE-ANJOU v. FRANCE [Extracts],1,Inadmissible,,"The applicants, Coopérative des agriculteurs de la Mayenne and Coopérative laitière Maine-Anjou, are farm cooperatives under French law whose registered offices are in Laval and Le Mans respectively. They were represented before the Court by Mr J.-C. Cavaille, a lawyer practising in Lyons. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant cooperatives, may be summarised as follows. Between 2 and 13 November 1992 the first applicant, Coopérative des agriculteurs de la Mayenne, was the subject of an inspection by the National Dairy Board (Onilait) aimed in particular at checking that its activities complied with Community Regulations Nos 804/68 of 27 June 1968 and 856/84 and 857/84 of 31 March 1984 (see “Relevant law” below). In two letters of 29 July 1993, the first applicant was informed that, following the inspection, it had come to light that the milk production quotas for the years 1988/89, 1989/90 and 1990/91 had been exceeded. The letters informed the applicant that it was required to pay Onilait the sums of 9,105,335.50 French francs (FRF), FRF 9,322,127.11 and FRF 14,534,813.51, corresponding to each of the years covered by the inspection. By three enforceable orders dated 8 December 1993, the Director of Onilait served notice on Coopérative des agriculteurs de la Mayenne, requiring it to pay the above sums to Onilait. On 7 January 1994 the cooperative applied to the Nantes Administrative Court seeking to have the enforceable orders set aside. On 9 March 1994 the cooperative handed over its milk collection operations to another cooperative, Coopérative laitière Maine-Anjou (the second applicant). On 15 April 1994 Coopérative laitière Maine-Anjou intervened in the proceedings before the Nantes Administrative Court and, relying on the same grounds as the first applicant, requested the court to uphold the conclusions set out in the latter’s application. On 30 April 1994 the Director of Onilait sent a demand for payment to the first applicant, seeking payment of the sum of FRF 24,013,557.93, corresponding to the additional levy for the 1991/92 milk marketing year. On 16 June 1994 the Director of Onilait issued an enforceable order to secure payment of the sum in question. Meanwhile, on 3 June 1994, the applicants requested the Nantes Administrative Court to set aside the payment demand of 30 April 1994. They subsequently also requested the setting-aside of the enforceable order of 16 June 1994. In a first judgment of 20 May 1998, ruling on the application of 7 January 1994 seeking to have the enforceable orders of 8 December 1993 set aside, the Nantes Administrative Court granted the second applicant’s request to be joined to the proceedings and dismissed the first applicant’s application, in particular on the following grounds: “... The applications ... lodged on behalf of Coopérative des agriculteurs de la Mayenne and Coopérative laitière Maine-Anjou raise the same issues and have been the subject of a joint investigation; they should therefore be joined and dealt with in a single judgment. ... The judgment in this case ... is likely to be prejudicial to the interests of Coopérative laitière Maine-Anjou. Accordingly, [its] application to be joined to the proceedings is admissible. ... The investigation has shown that Onilait, between 2 and 13 November 1992, inspected the accounts for 1988/89, 1989/90 and 1990/91. This inspection revealed deliveries of milk that had not been declared by Coopérative des agriculteurs de la Mayenne, which are the subject of the impugned requests for payment. ... As to the argument that the basis on which the sums were calculated was not indicated In submitting that Onilait did not indicate to it the exact amounts by which the quotas had been exceeded, Coopérative des agriculteurs de la Mayenne must be deemed to have claimed that the basis for calculating the amounts to be recovered under the enforceable orders in question was not indicated to it. While any enforceable order must indicate the basis on which the amounts payable have been calculated, this requirement does not apply where the person liable has already been informed of the basis for calculation in an earlier document. The investigation has shown that, contrary to the assertions of Coopérative des agriculteurs de la Mayenne, which was given notice by Onilait of the reference quantities allocated to it at the beginning of the 1988/89, 1989/90 and 1990/91 milk marketing years, the cooperative was informed by this State agency in three letters dated 29 July 1993 of the corrections to the basis of assessment arising out of the checks carried out between 2 and 13 November [1992] and of the resulting additional levies. It follows that Coopérative des agriculteurs de la Mayenne which, in its capacity as purchaser – which it cannot seriously dispute – was required to identify the producers whose deliveries were in excess of the quotas, may not validly argue that the basis on which the amounts owing were calculated was not made sufficiently clear. As to the argument that the manner in which the cost of the additional levy was to be passed on to producers was not set out in a prefectoral order Contrary to what has been asserted by the applicant cooperative, which does not rely on any specific text, it is not stated in any legislative or regulatory provision, or elsewhere, that the manner in which the cost of the additional levy is to be passed on to producers should be set down in a prefectoral order. Accordingly, this argument must be rejected. As to the argument alleging unequal treatment between producers While the provisions of the decree of 17 July 1984, reiterated in the decree of 11 [February] 1991, make the levies payable by producers partly subject to the situation of the purchaser whom they supply, the difference which may result is inherent in the mechanism of “Formula B”, as defined in Article 5c of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68. Accordingly, the Court must reject the argument that the impugned enforceable orders, which arose out of the imposition of additional levies triggered by the high level of deliveries, applied rules that were discriminatory. As to the argument that the Community objectives were not complied with The applicant cooperative submits that the enforceable orders in question did not comply with the objective of curbing the increase in milk production laid down in the Community rules, on the grounds that the corrections were made late, after the end of the years in question, and that the enforceable orders did not make it possible to determine how the levies were to be allocated subsequently. In confining itself to these criticisms – which, moreover, are shown by the foregoing to be unfounded – Coopérative des agriculteurs de la Mayenne has failed to provide any evidence to demonstrate that the enforceable orders were contrary to Community objectives, as it alleges. Accordingly, the Court must reject this argument also. ...” In a second judgment of 20 May 1998, the Nantes Administrative Court rejected the application lodged on 3 June 1994, in particular on the following grounds: “... the applications ... challenge two measures taken in the same set of recovery proceedings instituted by Onilait against the first cooperative ... and were the subject of a single investigation. They should therefore be joined and dealt with in a single judgment ... As to the argument that the basis on which the amounts were calculated was not indicated ... It is clear from the investigation that the demand for payment in question referred expressly to the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products, cited above, which provides the legal basis for the impugned levies. In addition, the demand for payment presented in sufficient detail the figures for excess production observed at the end of the 1991/92 milk marketing year and arising out of the inspection conducted in 1992, and the means of calculating the amounts in question, thus enabling the person liable to assess the validity of the claim and the amount thereof. It follows that there is no foundation for the assertion made by Coopérative des agriculteurs de la Mayenne, whose capacity as purchaser – which it cannot seriously dispute – required it to identify those producers whose deliveries exceeded the quotas, and by Coopérative [laitière] Maine-Anjou, to the effect that the basis on which the amounts to be recovered were calculated was not made sufficiently clear. Furthermore, while any enforceable order must indicate the basis on which the amounts payable have been calculated, this requirement does not apply where the person liable has already been informed of the basis for calculation in an earlier document. The investigation showed that the enforceable order at issue had been preceded by the above-mentioned demand for payment, which gave details both of the legislation forming the legal basis for the claim and the elements used to calculate it. Accordingly, the requirement referred to above must be regarded as having been fulfilled in the present case ... As to the argument that the manner in which the cost of the additional levy was to be passed on to producers was not laid down in a prefectoral order Contrary to what has been asserted by the applicant cooperatives, which do not rely on any specific text, it is not stated in any legislative or regulatory provision, or elsewhere, that the manner in which the cost of the additional levy is to be passed on to producers should be set down in a prefectoral order. Accordingly, this argument must be rejected. ...” On 28 August 1998 the applicants lodged an appeal against the two judgments of the Nantes Administrative Court. In a judgment of 14 June 2000, the Nantes Administrative Court of Appeal rejected the applicants’ appeal against the first judgment, in particular on the following grounds: “... having regard to the requirement for Onilait, pursuant to the Community rules and Decree no. 91-157 of 11 February 1991, to seek payment of the additional levy owed by purchasers, the decisions in accordance with which Onilait imposes the levy on purchasers cannot be regarded as unfavourable individual administrative decisions for which reasons must be given pursuant to section 1 of the Act of 11 July 1979, cited above ... As stated above, Coopérative des agriculteurs de la Mayenne was in a position to challenge all the elements in the correction carried out. In a letter of 13 May 1993, Onilait sent it a copy of the findings of the on-site inspection conducted lawfully in November 1992 by officials of the Central Board for Agricultural Intervention Agencies [...] on the basis of Decree no. 85-367 of 26 March 1985 and Article 19 of the decree of 11 February 1991, cited above, and gave it fifteen days to reply. The cooperative was able throughout the proceedings to submit its observations, which were taken into account in order to reduce the correction. Hence, the cooperative in question has no basis for arguing a violation of the adversarial principle or of its defence rights. There was no provision of Community or domestic law, or any general legal principle, requiring the cooperative to be informed of its right to be assisted by a lawyer. Nor is there any foundation for the applicants’ allegation of a violation of Article 6 §§ 1, 2 and 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as these provisions do not lay down any rule or principle whose scope extends beyond proceedings before the courts to encompass Onilait, which is not a court for the purposes of those provisions ... Article 5c of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68, as amended by the abovementioned Regulation No 856/84, states that under Formula B, which France decided to apply, the additional levy is payable by purchasers of milk and that ‘the purchaser liable to the levy shall pass on the burden in the price paid to those producers who have increased their deliveries, in proportion to their contribution to the purchaser’s reference quantity being exceeded’. However, this provision does not have the effect of requiring member States to introduce a procedure for passing on the cost of the levy under the supervision of the authorities but, on the contrary, states that it is for purchasers to pass on the cost of the levy to the producers. Accordingly, the ground of appeal arguing that the French rules are in breach of Regulation No 856/84 cannot succeed. France’s decision to opt for Formula B was based on the provisions of Article 5c of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68, as amended by Regulation No 856/84 of 31 March 1984, to which the French rules simply gave effect in this regard. Consequently, the grounds of appeal to the effect that those rules are in breach of the principles of equality and proportionality are in any case ineffective. ... An administrative court, in examining submissions challenging an enforceable order or a collection order as in the present case may, after checking the facts relied upon and their characterisation by the authorities and depending on the outcome, decide to uphold or reduce the amount payable by the person concerned or, where appropriate, to discharge him or her from liability. On the other hand, the provisions concerning the additional levy do not permit the court or the authorities to adjust the rate of the levy. Nor does the need to comply with the provisions of Article 6 § 1 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms imply that the court should adjust the amount of the levy. Accordingly, the ground of appeal based on a breach of the right to a fair hearing must fail. ...” In a further judgment of 14 June 2000, the Administrative Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal lodged by the applicants against the second judgment, on similar grounds to those outlined above, adding: “...The fact that the order of 20 June 1992 on arrangements for collection of the additional levy for the 1991/92 milk marketing year came into effect after the end of the year in question does not mean that it should be regarded as retrospective, in breach of the law, since the levy, which is based on excess production during the year and the basis and amount of which were laid down by the orders of 29 March and 24 July 1991 which came into force before the end of the year, cannot be collected until the end of the relevant year. Since Council Regulation (EEC) No 3950/92 of 28 December 1992 applied only from 1993/94 onwards, the ground of appeal to the effect that the decree of 11 February 1991 on controlling cow’s milk production was in breach of that Regulation is ineffective in the context of the present case, which relates to the 1991/92 milk marketing year ...” On 12 September 2000 the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law with the Conseil d’Etat against the two judgments delivered by the Nantes Administrative Court of Appeal on 14 June 2000. They argued in particular that the levy at issue was in breach of the provisions of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In a judgment of 5 November 2003, the Conseil d’Etat joined the two cases but dismissed the appeal on the following grounds: “... The applications referred to above both relate to the same issue and should therefore be dealt with in a single decision. ... In addressing the grounds of appeal arguing that the inspection carried out concerning Coopérative des agriculteurs de la Mayenne had been unlawful, the court observed that the latter, in accordance with the overall principle of due process, had been in a position to challenge all the elements in the correction notified to it by Onilait in its letter of 13 May 1993 setting out the findings of the on-site inspection conducted lawfully in November 1992 by officials of the Central Board for Agricultural Intervention Agencies, and that it had been able throughout the proceedings to submit its observations, which were taken into account, among other things, in order to reduce the correction. The court dismissed the grounds of appeal alleging that the French rules were in breach of the Community rules or contrary to the principles of equality and proportionality. Accordingly, the court addressed adequately those grounds of appeal submitted to it which were not inoperative. ... An enforceable order must indicate the basis on which the amounts payable have been calculated, even where it is issued by a public agency other than the State, for which the requirement is expressly laid down in Article 81 of the decree of 29 December 1962. In accordance with this principle, Onilait cannot request payment of an additional levy without indicating, either in the order itself or by reference to a document attached to it or previously addressed to the person liable, the basis for and the elements contained in its calculation of the amounts due. Onilait satisfied this requirement in the instant case by making reference in the impugned enforceable orders to the letters of 30 July 1993 to the applicant cooperatives, which the latter do not deny having received and which, in the context of the adversarial procedure which the authorities were obliged to conduct before correcting the declared bases, set out clearly the basis on which the amounts payable had been calculated. Consequently, the Nantes Administrative Court of Appeal did not commit any error of law in finding the enforceable orders in question to be lawful. ...” “... Whereas the operation and development of the common market in agricultural products must be accompanied by the establishment of a common agricultural policy to include in particular a common organisation of agricultural markets which may take various forms depending on the product; ... Whereas the aim of the common agricultural policy is to attain the objectives set out in Article 39 of the Treaty; whereas, in the milk sector, in order to stabilise markets and to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community concerned, it is necessary that the intervention agencies continue to take intervention measures on the market, such measures however to be standardised so as not to impede the free movement of the goods in question within the Community; ...” “... Whereas the market in milk products in the Community is suffering from structural surpluses as a result of an imbalance between supply and demand for the products ... Whereas a careful examination of the different possible ways of re-establishing balance in the milk sector shows that, despite the administrative difficulties which its implementation may involve, the most effective method, and the one having the least drastic effect on the incomes of producers, is the introduction for an initial period of five years of an additional levy on quantities of milk delivered beyond a guarantee threshold; ... Whereas, in view of the diversity of milk production structures in the different regions of the Community, the administrative problems arising and considerations of regional development policy, the possibility must be provided for of a choice between a formula of a reference quantity per producer and a reference quantity per purchaser; Whereas, where the levy is to be paid by the purchaser, provision should be made for ensuring that the purchaser passes on the burden in the price paid to those producers who have increased their deliveries, in proportion to their contribution to the purchaser’s reference quantity being exceeded; Whereas the purpose of the levy provided for by this Regulation is to regulate and stabilise the market in milk and milk products; whereas revenue from the said levy should therefore be used to finance expenditure in the milk and milk products sector; ... Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 is hereby amended as follows: 1. The following Article 5c is inserted: ‘Article 5c 1. During five consecutive periods of 12 months beginning on 1 April 1984, an additional levy payable by producers or purchasers of cows’ milk shall be introduced. ... The levy system shall be implemented in each region of the territory of the member States in accordance with one of the following formulas: ... Formula B – A levy shall be payable by every purchaser of milk or other milk products on the quantities of milk or milk equivalent which have been delivered to him by a producer and which, during the 12 months concerned, exceed a reference quantity to be determined. – The purchaser liable to the levy shall pass on the burden in the price paid to those producers who have increased their deliveries, in proportion to their contribution to the purchaser’s reference quantity being exceeded. ...’” “... Whereas Article 5c of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 instituted a levy payable by every producer or purchaser of milk or other milk products on quantities exceeding an annual reference quantity; whereas the amount of this levy should normally cover the cost of disposal of the milk exceeding the reference quantity; whereas, however, when the levy is charged to the purchaser, its application does not necessarily cover all the quantities of milk delivered by each producer and exceeding a quantity corresponding to that adopted in order to establish the purchaser’s reference quantity; whereas, in order to obtain equivalence of results, a higher levy should be fixed when it is payable by the purchaser; Whereas the reference quantity should be fixed on the basis of the quantity which corresponds to the 1981 calendar year ..., plus 1%; whereas, however, for reasons to do with their production or collecting conditions, member States should be enabled to adopt as a basis the quantity corresponding to the 1982 calendar year or to the 1983 calendar year, weighted by a percentage enabling the same results to be achieved; ... 1. The levy referred to in Article 5c of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 is hereby fixed at: – 75% of the target price for milk, where Formula A is applied, – 100% of the target price for milk, where Formula B is applied, – 75% of the target price for milk, where there is direct sale to consumption. ...” “Regulation (EEC) No 857/84 is hereby amended as follows: 1. in Article 1 (1) first and second indents, ‘100%’ is replaced by ‘115%’;” “This Regulation ... shall apply ... from the beginning of the seventh period of application of the additional levy arrangements with regard to Article 1 (1). ...” “The National Dairy Board (‘Onilait’) shall be responsible for the following tasks relating to cow’s milk: 1. Determining the reference quantities within the meaning of Article 5c of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 ... for purchasers of milk and milk equivalent; the purchasers shall inform the producers which deliver to them of the reference quantities which have been allocated; 2. Determining directly the reference quantities for producers selling direct to consumption; ... 4. Collecting the additional levy introduced by Community Regulations Nos 804/68, amended, and 857/84 ...” “The additional levy referred to in Article 1 shall be payable by any purchaser of milk or other milk products on the quantity of milk or milk equivalent delivered to him in excess of the reference quantity allocated by Onilait. The purchaser liable for the levy shall pass on the cost of the levy only to those producers which have exceeded the reference quantity, in proportion to their contribution to the purchaser’s reference quantity being exceeded.”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
27,001-22159,ENG,FRA,ADMISSIBILITY,2001,EINHORN v. FRANCE,1,Inadmissible,Nicolas Bratza,"1. The applicant is an American national born in 1940. He is represented before the Court by Ms C. Waquet, of the Conseil d’Etat and Court of Cassation Bar. 2. The applicant formerly lived in Pennsylvania (United States of America), a State in which the death penalty was reintroduced by a statute of 13 September 1978. He was arrested there on 28 March 1979 after the mummified body of his girlfriend, who had disappeared in 1977, was discovered at his home. On 3 April 1979 he was released on bail, and on 17 April 1979 an information was filed against him. In 1981, while the proceedings were taking their course, the applicant left the United States. A trial was held in absentia, and on 29 September 1993 the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas found the applicant guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment. The applicant’s lawyer applied to have the conviction reviewed but without success. He subsequently appealed to the Pennsylvania Superior Court, which declared the appeal inadmissible on the ground that the applicant had not appeared in court; a petition to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for review of that decision was dismissed on the same ground. 3. The applicant was placed on Interpol’s wanted list and was tracked down in France, where he was arrested in June 1997. On 12 June 1997 the United States Government requested the French Government to extradite him so that he could serve the sentence imposed on him in absentia. He was taken into custody pending a ruling on his extradition. 4. In a judgment of 4 December 1997 the Indictment Division of the Bordeaux Court of Appeal ruled against extradition and ordered the applicant’s release. Basing its judgment on Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (c), the Indictment Division held, in particular, that the applicant had not unequivocally waived the right to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing, that he had been tried and convicted in absentia without being able to obtain from a court which had heard him a fresh determination of the merits of the charge in respect of both law and fact, and that the extradition treaty between France and the United States did not entail any obligation to extradite where the proceedings in issue contravened French public policy or the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights. The French authorities did not proceed with the extradition. 5. By a statute which came into force on 27 January 1998 the Pennsylvania legislature made a change to the relevant procedure so that persons convicted in absentia could, in certain cases, be granted a retrial. In a diplomatic note of 2 July 1998 the United States Government submitted a further request for the applicant’s extradition, stating that he would be granted a new trial if he so requested and that the death penalty would not be sought, imposed or executed. The applicant was taken into custody pending a ruling on his extradition. 6. On 18 February 1999 the Indictment Division of the Bordeaux Court of Appeal ruled in favour of the applicant’s extradition and ordered him to be released and placed under court supervision. The following conditions were attached to the Indictment Division’s ruling: the applicant was to be granted a new and fair trial, if he so requested, on returning to Pennsylvania, and to be able to avail himself of the remedies provided by the requesting State, and the death penalty was not to be sought and, if imposed, was not to be carried out. On 27 May 1999 the Court of Cassation dismissed an appeal on points of law against that ruling. 7. In a decree of 24 July 2000 the French Prime Minister granted the extradition on condition that, pursuant to the statute of 27 January 1998, the applicant was given a new and fair trial if he so requested on returning to Pennsylvania, and that the death penalty was not sought, imposed or carried out. The decree stated, inter alia: “According to the assurances given by the District Attorney of Philadelphia County on behalf of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Ira Samuel Einhorn will be retried, if he so requests, and will be able to avail himself of the remedies provided by the requesting State. The death penalty may not be sought, imposed or executed in respect of Ira Samuel Einhorn.” 8. The applicant applied to the Prime Minister to reconsider his decision; that application was dismissed on 4 October 2000. On the same day he applied to the Conseil d’Etat to quash both decisions. In support of his application, he argued in particular that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania’s statute of 27 January 1998 contravened the principle of separation of powers enshrined in the Pennsylvania Constitution and that its constitutionality should normally be raised by the courts of their own motion or might be raised by the civil parties to the proceedings or by any citizen. That would be an obstacle to his being granted a new trial in conditions complying with Article 6 of the Convention. He further submitted that his extradition had been granted by the French Government on the basis of a specially passed law with retrospective effect (the statute of 27 January 1998), which had been enacted with the sole aim of influencing the judicial outcome of the extradition proceedings against him, thereby breaching his right to a fair trial. He added that in any event, in view of the “pressure of legal and media attention” which the case had generated in the United States and which a jury would be not have been able to avoid, he would not be retried in Pennsylvania in conditions satisfying the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention. He further maintained that his extradition would contravene Article 3 of the Convention in that he would, in any event, be likely to have to serve a full life sentence without any genuine prospect of remission or parole. In addition, he alleged that, in view of the fact that the victim’s body had been found after the death penalty had been restored in Pennsylvania, it was not to be excluded that he would be sentenced to death, especially as it had not been established that the death penalty could not be imposed by a court where it had not been sought by the prosecution; there were therefore substantial grounds for believing that he faced a real risk of being sentenced to death and hence of being exposed to the “death-row phenomenon”, so that his extradition would breach Article 3 of the Convention. 9. In a judgment of 12 July 2001 the Conseil d’Etat dismissed Mr Einhorn’s applications. With regard to the first of the above-mentioned grounds, the Conseil d’Etat held that it was not for it to rule whether enactments applicable within the territory of the requesting State were in conformity with that State’s Constitution; matters could only be otherwise if the impugned enactment had already been declared unconstitutional by means of a final decision in that State or if there had been “such serious irregularities [in its adoption] that it must be regarded as invalid”. With regard to the second ground, the Conseil d’Etat held that the statute of 27 January 1998 was “applicable in exactly the same manner to all persons tried and convicted in absentia who have fled to a foreign country which refuses to extradite them because they were convicted in absentia” and that the applicant had not furnished any information enabling it to assess whether there was any foundation for his statement that a retrial would not be fair on account of the circumstances in which the statute in issue had been enacted. With regard to the third ground, the Conseil d’Etat held that in any event, “the extradition of a person who faces a sentence of life imprisonment without any possibility of early release is not contrary to French public policy or Article 3 of the Convention”. The fourth ground was dismissed for the following reason: “The extradition request ... relates to acts committed in September 1977, before the enactment ... of the statute of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in which the death penalty was introduced; the evidence shows that that statute cannot be applied to offences committed before it came into force. Even supposing that ... the offence of which [the applicant] is accused might be regarded at a new trial as having been committed after the statute of 13 September 1978 came into force in view of the fact that the victim’s body was not discovered until 28 March 1979, the Government of the United States of America gave an assurance in its request of 2 July 1998 that if [the applicant’s] extradition was agreed to, the death penalty would not be sought, imposed or carried out. The District Attorney of Philadelphia County has twice given an undertaking that the death penalty will not be sought in respect of [the applicant]. In an affidavit of 23 June 1997 she gave a formal assurance that in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania the death penalty could not be imposed if it had not been sought. Consequently, there is no basis for [the applicant’s] submission that, despite the conditions attached to the impugned order, his extradition had been granted without sufficient guarantees being offered and was therefore contrary to French public policy.” On the same day, after the judgment had been delivered, the applicant cut his throat and slashed his left wrist. On 17 July 2001 the Government produced to the Court a medical certificate dated 12 July 2001, which attested that the applicant’s state of health was compatible with his transfer to the United States. 10. On 19 July 2001 the Court lifted the interim measure it had indicated to the respondent Government under Rule 39 on 12 July 2001. The applicant was extradited to the United States on the same day. 11. The statute which came into force on 27 January 1998 (42 Pennsylvania Criminal Statutes (PaCS), section 9543(c)), provides: “Extradition. – If the petitioner’s conviction and sentence resulted from a trial conducted in his absence, and if the petitioner has fled to a foreign country that refuses to extradite him because a trial in absentia was employed, the petitioner shall be entitled to the grant of a new trial if the refusing country agrees by virtue of this provision to return him, and if the petitioner upon such return to this jurisdiction so requests. This subsection shall apply notwithstanding any other law or judgment to the contrary.” 12. In an affidavit dated 23 June 1997 the District Attorney, Ms Abraham, gave the following undertaking: “I, Lynne Abraham, District Attorney for the City and County of Philadelphia, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, do hereby state that the death penalty has not been sought in this case at any time, nor can it be legally imposed in this case. The District Attorney’s Office will not seek the death penalty in any future action regarding this case, nor can it legally do so. Further, the Court cannot pronounce the death penalty in this case on its own motion under Pennsylvania law.” Following the entry into force of the statute of 27 January 1998, Ms Abraham swore a further affidavit, on 10 June 1998, “in support of request for extradition from France”. The affidavit stated that it was “binding on the Commonwealth and [the District Attorney’s] Office” and that “the District Attorney’s Office now can, and does, give full assurances that Einhorn will receive a new trial at his request upon his return to Pennsylvania”. The District Attorney further stated: “The Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office will fully support Einhorn’s right to a new trial under this statute. Under United States law, which applies to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, this promise binds not only the present District Attorney, but all future District Attorneys and every prosecutor who may be responsible for the prosecution.” The District Attorney added: “... under Pennsylvania law, it is impossible for a court to impose the death penalty for murders committed prior to the enactment of the death penalty statute on September 13, 1978. Because Einhorn murdered [the victim] in 1977, he is not subject to the death penalty as a matter of law”. She also stated the following: “The United States Constitution prohibition against ex post facto laws in Article 1, Section 9, protects a person from the imposition of a penalty that was increased after he committed his criminal acts. The Supreme Court of the United States has explained that the ex post facto clause bars a legislature from retroactively altering the definition of crimes or increasing the punishment for criminal acts. Consequently, Pennsylvania cannot change its law to impose the death penalty for any murder prior to the enactment of the statute. Therefore, the statute applies only to murders committed after its enactment. The case of Commonwealth v. Truesdale, decided by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on September 15, 1983, unequivocally prohibits imposition of the death penalty for murders which were committed before the passage of the death penalty statute on September 13, 1978. The opinion binds all Pennsylvania courts, District Attorneys and prosecutors regarding the imposition of the death penalty. ... The death penalty has never been sought or imposed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in this case. The District Attorney has submitted an affidavit that no death penalty can be imposed, nor will the death penalty be sought... Any representation that the death penalty is a possibility is false. Under United States law, which binds the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the District Attorney’s promise binds not only the present District Attorney, but all future District Attorneys and every prosecutor who may be responsible for the prosecution.” 13. In a diplomatic note of 2 July 1998 to the French Government, the United States embassy stated: “The new statute, 42 Pennsylvania Criminal Statutes (PACS) Section 9543 (c), enacted January 27, 1998, guarantees Ira Einhorn the right to a new trial for the murder of [the victim]”. It provided the following clarifications: “Under the new statute, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, through its District Attorney, is now able to and does guarantee that Ira Einhorn will receive a second trial, with all attendant rights, if he were extradited from France and if he requested a new trial. Consequently, the U.S. Government provides its assurances that, if the Government of France extradites Ira Einhorn to the United States [in connection with the murder of the victim in 1977 in the] Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Ira Einhorn will receive a new trial on the merits with all attendant rights. In addition, the U.S. Government provides its assurances that if the Government of France extradites Ira Einhorn to the United States to stand trial for murder in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the death penalty will not be sought, imposed or executed against Ira Einhorn for this offense. The sworn affidavit of District Attorney Lynne Abraham, dated June 10, 1998, and an earlier assurance by Abraham sworn June 23, 1997, affirms that under Pennsylvania law it is legally impossible for a prosecutor to seek or a court on its own motion to impose [the] death penalty for murders committed in Pennsylvania prior to September 13, 1978. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision, Commonwealth v. Truesdale, dated September 15, 1983, unequivocally prohibits the imposition of the death penalty for murders committed prior to the enactment of the Pennsylvania Death Penalty Statute on September 13, 1978. This decision binds all Pennsylvania courts, district attorneys and prosecutors regarding the imposition of the death penalty. ...” Those assurances were reiterated in a diplomatic note of 24 September 1999, in which it was also stated that the Supreme Court had held that laws enacted after a criminal judgment had been delivered, particularly where they might benefit the accused, were not inconsistent with the prohibition on ex post facto laws (see Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U.S. 37-1990), a fact which served to confirm the constitutionality of the 1998 Pennsylvania statute guaranteeing the applicant a new trial on his return to the United States. 14. In an affidavit of 22 May 2001, however, Norris E. Gelman, the lawyer who had represented the applicant at his trial in absentia in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, affirmed that in the Charles Diggs case in 1992 the District Attorney of Philadelphia County had sought the death penalty for offences committed before the statute of 13 September 1978 restoring the death penalty in Pennsylvania had been enacted. Mr Gelman stated: “In spite of all the governing authority being against retroactive application of the 1979 death penalty, Judge O’Keefe, who presided over Diggs’ trial, ruled that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania could seek the death penalty and question potential jurors about their views on the death penalty. The prosecutor never retreated from his position that he was entitled to seek the death penalty. The judge never reconsidered his ruling. ... Diggs was found not guilty, and that was the end of the case. The penalty portion of the case was never reached because of the acquittals. I never understood how the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as represented by the District Attorney’s Office in Philadelphia successfully argued the right of the State to use the death penalty retroactively as to Diggs, and still do not understand how that happened.” 15. In an affidavit of 20 April 1998 Leonard Sosnov, a member of the Bars of Pennsylvania, the Federal District Court, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and the United States Supreme Court and an associate professor at Widener University School of Law, argued that the statute of 27 January 1998 was unconstitutional. He stated, inter alia: “In my professional opinion, the provision is clearly, without a doubt, unconstitutional. As a matter of separation of powers under the Pennsylvania Constitution, it has been well established for almost one hundred and fifty years in Pennsylvania that the legislature has no power to disturb final judgments of conviction and sentence. In De Chastellux v. Fairchild, 15 Pa. 18 (1850), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that a statute purporting to grant a new trial to a litigant was unconstitutional. Likewise, in Commonwealth v. Sutley, 378 A.2d 789 (1977), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held unconstitutional a statute which purported to reduce penalties for defendants who had already been sentenced for marijuana possession. ... The statute is also clearly unconstitutional because it violates Article V, § 10 (c) of the Pennsylvania Constitution which gives the Pennsylvania Supreme Court exclusive power to control matters of practice and procedure in the courts, while providing no power for the legislature. ... There are other potential constitutional problems with the statute. For example, the provision does not grant a new trial to all defendants convicted in absentia, but only to those who have been refused extradition, notably only Mr Einhorn. The courts may view this statute as an arbitrary and capricious legislative enactment which is a violation of due process or a prohibited legislative bill of attainder directed to a particular individual. However, it should be unnecessary for a court to reach these issues because of its palpable unconstitutionality on separation of powers and Article V, § 10 (c) grounds.” He reiterated that conclusion in affidavits of 10 September and 10 November 1998, stating, inter alia (extract from the affidavit of 10 September): “... The legislature is without authority to change final judgments of the courts. ... In my expert opinion, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office have no power at all to insulate this law from judicial review. Because ... the legislative attempt to overturn a court’s judgment of conviction on a murder case and life sentence is obviously violative of Article V, § 10 (c) and separation of powers under the Pennsylvania Constitution, a court will ultimately invalidate [the impugned statute] and hold that it is void. If France extradites Mr Einhorn to Pennsylvania it is extremely likely, despite the new Pennsylvania law, that he will be ordered to serve his life sentence without parole, received after his trial in absentia, without ever receiving a new trial. ... even when the parties in a criminal case agree to a result, judicial review and acceptance is always a prerequisite. ... If Mr Einhorn is returned to Pennsylvania and neither party challenges [the impugned statute], purportedly granting him a new trial, it is very likely that the family of the murder victim, or even any taxpayer in Pennsylvania, could successfully bring a challenge to this clearly unconstitutional law. ... If Mr Einhorn is ordered extradited to the United States, it is very likely that there will be a challenge to the constitutionality of [the impugned statute] which will be heard by the courts, which in turn will then declare the statute unconstitutional null and void. The original conviction and sentence, life without parole for Mr Einhorn, will be held to be valid and enforceable under Pennsylvania law.” 16. In an affidavit of 24 September 1998 John W. Packel, of the Philadelphia Bar and Chief of the Appeals Division of the Philadelphia Public Defender Office, reached the same conclusion. He stated, inter alia: “... if Mr. Einhorn returns to Pennsylvania and asserts the right granted to him – and him alone – the Pennsylvania Supreme Court will invalidate the statute and Mr. Einhorn will be recommitted, without a new trial, to serve the life sentence imposed after a trial at which he was not present, a sentencing at which he was not present, and an appeal he was not permitted to litigate.” In an affidavit of 27 November 1998 he declared: “... Frankly, I am appalled, but not surprised, by the District Attorney’s ‘guarantee’ which refers to the statute granting a new trial but makes no reference whatsoever to controlling decisions of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court unequivocally holding that any such statute is invalid. Furthermore, I am surprised and disappointed by the State Department’s blind endorsement of this deliberately misleading document. Although including citations to legal authority addressing issues that are not germane to the principal issues the District Attorney ignores, making absolutely no reference to, clear and compelling authority establishing that the statute it drafted is unconstitutional, unenforceable and invalid. ... Given 150 years of contrary unbroken precedent it is impossible to see how the District Attorney can ‘guarantee’ that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court will allow the statute in question to stand and allow or order a retrial. In the light of any real consideration the District Attorney’s ‘guarantee’ must be dismissed as, at the least, misleading. ...” 17. In an affidavit of 10 November 1998 Richard S. Wasserbly, an attorney admitted to practise law in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and before the Federal District Court, the Federal Third Circuit Court of Appeals and the United States Supreme Court and the author of the reference work entitled Pennsylvania Criminal Practice, stated: “... I have reached the same inexorable conclusions as were reached by Professor Sosnov and Mr Packel, to wit: that this legislation runs afoul of the Pennsylvania Constitution as a violation of the separation of powers. In addition, this legislation violates Article V, section 10(c), and it may also be a violation of due process and a prohibited legislative bill of attainder since it is directed apparently exclusively to the extradition matter involving Mr Einhorn. Should an extradition be granted and Mr Einhorn is returned to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, if Mr Einhorn requests the grant of a new trial pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(c), the court must act constitutionally and the court has the power and authority to raise the constitutionality of the statute sua sponte (of its own will; without prompting or suggestion) and rule it unconstitutional, refuse to apply that statute, and refuse Mr Einhorn a new trial, irregardless of any position, motion, request or assent by the Commonwealth. In other words, the District Attorney of Philadelphia does not have the ability to authorize or promise the grant of a new trial pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(c). It is my opinion that if extradition is granted pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(c), there can be no guarantee of a new trial. Instead if viewed in the light of its clear unconstitutionality, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(c) will not be upheld and Mr Einhorn will not be given a new trial requiring him to serve the sentence already imposed.” 18. In an affidavit of 25 November 1998 Theodore Simon, a member of the Board of Directors of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and counsel for the applicant in the extradition proceedings, affirmed, inter alia: “... it becomes apparent and a distinct possibility that even if the District Attorney should fulfill her promise, and thereafter, even if a trial court should act or be about to act in a manner inconsistent with its ability to assume jurisdiction (i.e. by seeking to grant Einhorn a new trial) then the Supreme Court could, sua sponte (on its own motion), reach out and take jurisdiction to demonstrate that the Einhorn law is unconstitutional, and a lower court is not authorized to accept jurisdiction and vacate a final judgment pursuant to this ‘Einhorn law’.” 19. In an affidavit of 21 November 1998 Norris E. Gelman likewise argued that the statute of 27 January 1998 was “clearly unconstitutional” and that consequently, notwithstanding the pledge given by the District Attorney, Ms Abraham, no court had jurisdiction to apply the statute and the applicant could not be granted a new trial. In a further affidavit of 16 July 2001 he affirmed, inter alia: “The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is relying exclusively on the ‘Einhorn law’, passed on January 21, 1998 to assure France that Einhorn will be granted a new trial by a Pennsylvania court. It is my opinion, and the opinion of many other scholars, that a court will not, and indeed, cannot grant Einhorn a new trial pursuant to this statute or for any other reason. ... Merely because the law is not an ex post facto law does not make it constitutional. The constitutional defects in the Einhorn law render it unenforceable. It is unenforceable because it violates the constitutional separation of powers principles long established by both the United States Supreme Court and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. See Commonwealth v. Sutley, 474 Pa. 256, 378 A.2d 780 (1977) and Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, 514 U.S. 211, 131 L.Ed.2d 328, 115 S.Ct. 1447 (1995). The legislature cannot grant a new trial. It is as simple as that. The legislature cannot impair, alter, amend or vacate the final judgement of a court of law. The legislature can no more grant a new trial for Einhorn than it can for Timothy McVeigh, or the Watergate defendants. Should Einhorn be brought to the United States and the District Attorney, as promised, asked the court to grant him a new trial, the court would have to refuse to do so. The court would have to state that it could not act unconstitutionally and to grant a new trial pursuant to this statute, or for any other reason, would be to act in violation of the separation of powers concept and therefore unconstitutionally. ... ... [E]qually well settled ... is the rule that a law repugnant to the Constitution is void and that it is not only the right but the duty of a court so to declare when the violation unequivocably appears: see Respublica v. Duquest, 2 Yeats (Pa.) 429, 501 (1799)..., Hertz Drivurself Stations, Inc. v. Siggins, 359 Pa. 25, 33, 58 A.2d 464, 469 (1948). ... Wherefore, the above accurately states my position and the position of several of the most respected constitutional scholars in Pennsylvania, amongst whose number are Len Sosnov, Esquire (Professor of Law, University of Delaware Law School); John Packel, Esquire (Head of the Appeals Division of the Philadelphia Public Defender’s Office) and Emmett Fitzpatrick, Esquire (former District Attorney of Philadelphia).” 20. In an affidavit dated 1997 Joel Rosen, Chief of the Major Trials Unit, Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office, affirmed in particular that if the applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment, he would have the possibility of applying for release or for commutation of his sentence. Power to release prisoners or to commute their sentences was vested in the Governor of Pennsylvania (see Article IV, section 9, of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and section 299 of the Administrative Code). Any applications for release or for commutation of sentences were first examined by a Board of Pardons, comprising the Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania and three members appointed by the Governor and approved by vote of the Pennsylvania Senate (one of the three being a member of the Bar, one a penologist, and one a doctor of medicine, a psychiatrist or a psychologist). When the Board examined an application from a prisoner serving a life sentence, it was required to interview the prisoner. If the Board recommended commutation of a sentence and the Governor agreed, the decision was not subject to appeal. Mr Rosen pointed out, in particular, that between 1987 and 1994 the procedure had resulted in “302 releases, and 26 commutations of life-sentenced prisoners”. He concluded: “These statistics suggest that, although Einhorn may have little chance in the short run for gubernatorial relief, his longer term prospects are of a different nature. ... Were he to apply for release or commutation in the years immediately after his return, relief would be unlikely and, indeed, unjust. History indicates, however, that, by the time Einhorn has spent some considerable period in prison, the climate will have changed, and an application will be received in a different light.” 21. In an affidavit of 7 October 1997 Professor Leonard Sosnov gave his opinion on the likelihood of a life sentence being commuted. He stated that it would be virtually impossible for the applicant ever to be released from prison after being given a life sentence in Pennsylvania. In that connection, he explained that prisoners serving a life sentence were not eligible for parole unless the State Governor first commuted the sentence to another one of a duration which afforded that possibility. Under Article IV, section 9, of the Pennsylvania Constitution, the Governor could only consider commutation if the Board of Pardons had recommended it. Prisoners serving life sentences had to apply to the Board for permission to be interviewed by it; the decision whether or not to grant a hearing was taken by a majority. If a hearing was granted, the Board made a recommendation, again by a majority. Even supposing a prisoner serving a life sentence managed to overcome those obstacles and received an order from the Governor granting commutation, he would still have to serve at least one year in a pre-release centre before an application for parole could be considered. Decisions on admitting inmates to a pre-release centre were taken by the prison authorities, who had complete discretion in the matter. Even if an inmate was admitted to a pre-release centre, the Parole Board could refuse parole on any ground; that decision was not subject to review. Professor Sosnov added, among other things, that between 1979 and 1995 “there was an average of approximately three inmates a year whose life sentences were commuted”, whereas 2,400 inmates were currently serving life sentences in Pennsylvania. He concluded by stating: “Because Mr Einhorn has been a fugitive and has not as yet served any time on his Pennsylvania life sentence, there is no doubt, given the governing laws and the practical application of those laws, that a life sentence for Mr Einhorn in Pennsylvania would mean that he would eventually die in prison.”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
28,001-80255,ENG,DEU,ADMISSIBILITY,2007,COLLMANN v. GERMANY,4,Inadmissible,Peer Lorenzen,"The applicant, Mr Reiner Collmann, is a German national who was born in 1941 and lives in Fortaleza (Brazil). He was represented before the Court by Mr V. Hente, a lawyer practising in Strasbourg (France). The German Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs A. Wittling-Vogel, Ministerialdirigentin, of the Federal Ministry of Justice. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 15 July 1989 the motor yacht “Carat” caught fire and sank south of Cap Tossa between the Spanish coast and Ibiza. The German ship-owner and a Brazilian crew member were rescued by a Moroccan ferry passing by. Substantial damage was claimed for the loss of the vessel. The applicant submitted an expert report asserting that the market value of the ship was DEM 935,000. The insurance company and the Berlin police made an inquiry into the sinking of the vessel. On 23 October 1992 the Berlin-Tiergarten District Court (Amtsgericht) issued an international warrant of arrest against the applicant suspecting him of having taken part as an expert in asserting a fraudulent claim in an amount of approximately one million German marks against an insurance carrier for the loss of the motor yacht. On the applicant’s appeal the Berlin Regional Court (Landgericht) confirmed the warrant of arrest. On 30 March 1994 the applicant was arrested in Brazil and taken in detention in view of his extradition. On 13 August 1994 he was extradited to Germany and on 14 August 1994 taken in detention on remand. The indictment dated 25 November 1994 charged the applicant with insurance fraud under Article 265 of the Criminal Code (in its version in force until 31 March 1998). The applicant was accused of having been involved with others in the intentional sinking of an insured ship for the purpose of deriving an unjust economic advantage. The applicant’s requests for release were dismissed by the Berlin Regional Court on the ground that there was a risk of collusion. On 15 June 1995 the trial started before Berlin Regional Court (Landgericht). On 26 April 1996 the applicant complained to the Berlin Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof) claiming that there was no evidence to suspect him of having committed or prepared an offence, and that his preventive detention was unlawful. On 9 May 1996 the Regional Court ordered the applicant’s release having regard inter alia to the long period spent by the applicant in detention on remand. On 20 November 1996 the applicant withdrew his constitutional complaint to the Berlin Constitutional Court.. On 11 March 1998 the Berlin Regional Court convicted another accused involved in the loss of the ship of fraud and sentenced him to two years’ imprisonment. On 31 October 1996, after having held 73 hearings, the Regional Court stayed the proceedings and revoked the warrant of arrest issued against the applicant on the ground that he suffered from a long-lasting illness. Having regard to his poor health, it did not fix a new hearing. By the Sixth Criminal-Law Reform Act of 1998, Article 265 of the Criminal Code, among other provisions, has been amended reducing the limitation period from twenty to ten years. As a consequence thereof, the limitation period for the charges brought against the applicant under that provision expired on 15 July 1999. On 15 February 2000 the Regional Court discontinued the criminal proceedings on the ground of prescription of prosecution. It ordered the costs of the proceedings and the applicant’s necessary costs and expenses to be borne by the Treasury, while it refused to grant the applicant compensation for the prosecution measures taken against him, namely for the time spent in detention in view of his extradition and the detention on remand, the search of his home, office and his prison cell and the confiscation of a life raft and various documents. The Regional Court relied on Section 5 § 2, first sentence, of the Act on Compensation for Prosecution Measures (Gesetz über die Entschädigung für Strafverfolgungsmaßnahmen). In accordance with this provision compensation shall be denied if the accused had deliberately or grossly negligently caused the prosecution measures taken against him. According to the Regional Court, gross negligence was the failure to use such care as a reasonably prudent and careful person would use under similar circumstances in order to be protected against harm by prosecution measures, or the failure to do what a reasonable person would have done under the circumstances. The existence of gross negligence must be assessed with reference to those facts which were known at the time of issuing or maintaining the respective measure. The Regional Court considered that the prosecution measures were occasioned by the applicant’s gross negligence. It mentioned in particular that the ship for which an insurance claim was made, had turned out to be a ship that the applicant had bought under a pseudonym and had modified in order to make it look as a ship of a higher value corresponding to that described in his expert report. These facts were proven beyond a reasonable doubt at the time of issuing the warrant of arrest and had been confirmed by further investigations and the evidence obtained at the oral hearings. The applicant appealed against that decision arguing that the Regional Court had committed errors of fact and law and arbitrarily assessed the evidence. On 22 March 2000 the Berlin Court of Appeal (Kammergericht) dismissed the applicant’s appeal lodged against the above decision. On 15 January 2001 the Berlin Regional Court fixed the amount of the costs to be reimbursed to the applicant at DEM 812.80. The applicant’s appeal against this decision was dismissed by the Berlin Court of Appeal on 21 May 2001. On 18 May 2001 the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht), sitting as a bench of three judges, refused to admit the applicant’s constitutional complaint for adjudication without giving further reasons for its decision. Compensation for prosecution measures is covered by the Act on Compensation for Prosecution Measures (Gesetz über die Entschädigung für Strafverfolgungsmaßnahmen). In cases where an accused is acquitted or where the proceedings against him are discontinued or where a court refuses to open the proceedings against him, he is entitled to compensation for damages suffered due to time spent in detention on remand or due to other prosecution measures (Section 2). Pursuant to Section 5 § 2 of that law, compensation for prosecution measures shall be denied in cases where the accused has deliberately or in a grossly negligent manner caused the prosecution measure.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

He was not represented before the Court. The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Lucijan Bembič, State Attorney-General. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 7 June 1991, in the context of a real estate dispute, the applicant brought an action before the Celje Basic Court (Temeljno sodišče v Celju) against J.L. On 26 May 2000 the renamed Celje District Court (Okrožno sodišče v Celju) delivered a judgment rejecting the applicant’s claim. The applicant appealed against this judgment.

On 15 January 2003 the appeal on points of law was partly dismissed on procedural grounds and partly rejected by the Supreme Court (Vrhovno sodišče). The applicant subsequently lodged a constitutional appeal which was dismissed by the Constitutional Court (Ustavno sodišče) on 20 September 2004.

30,001-22911,ENG,GBR,ADMISSIBILITY,2002,TAYLOR v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,2,Inadmissible,Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant, Mark James Taylor, is a United Kingdom national, who was born in 1983 and lives in London. He is represented before the Court by Breeze, Benton & Co., Solicitors, London. The Government are represented by their Agent, Ms J. Foakes, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 25 March 1997 the applicant along with another youth (C.) were arrested by the police for suspected involvement in offences relating to the theft of a ring and causing severe injuries to its owner, a boy aged 11. The victim was rendered unconscious as a result of the attack and had to be detained in hospital for three days. He was treated for multiple and extensive bruising to his face and head as well as to the rest of his body. At the time of the commission of these offences, the applicant was aged 14 years and 24 days. On 3 April 1997 the applicant, who had earlier been released on bail, was formally charged with the offence of robbery contrary to section 8 (1) of the Theft Act 1968. He was again released on bail and attended Stratford Youth Court for the first time on 7 May 1997. C. failed to attend and a warrant was issued for his arrest. At the first hearing before Stratford Youth Court on 7 May 1997, the applicant’s lawyer obtained a two-week adjournment to allow him to consider the case outline served by the Crown Prosecution Service (“CPS”). At the hearing, although the matter was discussed, no decision was taken as to the court’s jurisdiction to sentence the applicant, if convicted, under section 53(2) and (3) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 (“the 1933 Act”). The applicant was released on bail. At the resumed hearing on 21 May 1997, Stratford Youth Court stated its intention to commit the applicant to the Crown Court for trial, given that the Crown Court had greater sentencing powers. The proceedings were adjourned until 16 July 1997 to enable the case to be prepared for committal. At the hearing on 16 July 1997, the CPS withdrew the robbery charge and replaced it with charges of theft contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 and assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to section 47 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 (“the 1861 Act”). Stratford Youth Court accepted jurisdiction over these charges since they were within its sentencing remit. The applicant pleaded not guilty. The case was adjourned for two weeks to allow the CPS to obtain and review further medical evidence with a view to a possible preferment of a more serious charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, contrary to section 18 of the 1861 Act. According to the applicant, the CPS created unnecessary delay by not reviewing the charges earlier. There was no reason why the trial date could not have been fixed at the 16 July hearing and the medical evidence submitted in due course. Instead, Stratford Youth Court allowed a two-week adjournment to enable the CPS to review the medical evidence. In the applicant’s view, the CPS should in any event have known the extent of the victim’s injuries by 16 July 1997, without having to be given a two-week adjournment to review the medical evidence. At the next hearing on 30 July 1997, Stratford Youth Court fixed a pre-trial review hearing for 8 October 1997 and the trial for 4 November 1997. The medical evidence sought by the CPS was still not available. However, the CPS did not request a further adjournment. On 8 October 1997 Stratford Youth Court had to adjourn the pre-trial review since the co-accused C. had failed to attend. The pre-trial review was adjourned until 15 October 1997. On that occasion, the date of the trial was fixed for 20 and 21 November 1997. According to the Government, the applicant’s representative did not object to these dates. The applicant denies this and states that objection was made regarding further delay. On 20 November 1997 the applicant failed to attend Stratford Youth Court. An application by the CPS to proceed in his absence was refused. A warrant was issued for his arrest. The applicant turned up at Stratford Youth Court on 21 November 1997. He stated that he had forgotten that he was due to attend court the day before. The court adjourned the proceedings to 26 November 1997 so that arrangements could be made for another trial date to be set. At the directions hearing on 26 November 1997,Stratford Youth Court fixed the date of the pre-trial review hearing for 17 December 1997. The trial was set down for 12 March 1998. The pre-trial review had to be adjourned twice and was eventually held on 25 February 1998 and again on 4 March 1998. On the latter occasions the defence made submissions on disclosure of materials in the possession of the CPS. The applicant points out that the CPS should have disclosed the materials requested at a much earlier stage of the proceedings, for example at the hearing on 17 December 1997. In the meantime the applicant had turned fifteen on 1 March 1998. On 12 March 1998, 340 days after the applicant was first arrested and 11 days after his fifteenth birthday, trial commenced. The victim gave evidence and was cross-examined by live video link. The defence made unsuccessful applications for disclosure of evidence and to have other evidence excluded at the trial, especially the victim’s evidence identifying the applicant and his co-accused. On 13 March 1998 the applicant was convicted of theft and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Stratford Youth Court, pursuant to section 37 of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1980 (“the 1980 Act”), committed the applicant to Snaresbrook Crown Court for sentence, being of the view that its powers of sentencing were inadequate and that the applicant should be given a heavier sentence than it had power to impose. On 17 June 1998 Snaresbrook Crown Court adjourned the case to 18 August 1998 so that pre-sentence reports could be prepared. On that date His Honour Justice Smith, sitting with two lay justices, sentenced the applicant to 18 months’ detention in a Young Offender institution. The applicant was given leave by a Single Judge to appeal to the Court of Appeal against his sentence. Before the Court of Appeal counsel for the applicant contended that the sentence handed down was unlawful on the grounds that the fact that the applicant has passed his fifteenth birthday during the proceedings, but before conviction, meant that he should be liable only for the same penalties as a fourteen-year old. Accordingly, he maintained, a sentence of detention in a Young Offender institution could not be passed on him. On 22 September 1998 the appeal was refused. In dismissing the appeal, Mr Justice Turner stated: “The simple truth is that [the applicant] was indeed fortunate not to have been charged with, and then convicted of, the even more serious offence of robbery. ... We consider that for the circumstances of the offence ... any right-thinking member of the public would have been appalled if the result had not been the deprivation of liberty of those who committed these offences against such a young boy and with such obvious violence and persistence which were involved in this case. It is urged upon us that because the co-accused has absconded and there was a delay of about 18 months between the commission of the offence and sentence, this would have enabled the court to impose a sentence of custody in a young offender institution. That sentence became available because [the applicant] had turned 15 between the date of the offence and the date of sentence. As a submission, that is entirely accurate. As a submission that leads this court to doubt the correctness of the sentence passed on [the applicant], we not only doubt, we profoundly disagree. In any event it would have been open, given the seriousness of the offences with which [the applicant] was charged and been found guilty, to have considered sentencing under the provisions of section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933.” The applicant’s request for an extension of the time-limit for an application to the Court of Appeal to have a question of public importance certified for an appeal to the House of Lords was refused on 29 January 1999. Lord Justice Rose stated: “It may be some comfort to those who have appeared on behalf of this applicant to be reminded that in any event a case in which a sentence has been passed which was within the discretion of the sentencing court cannot properly be regarded as a point of law of general public importance worthy of consideration of the House of Lords.” There are three kinds of criminal offences in English law: summary offences (triable only in the Magistrates’/Youth Court); “either way” offences (triable either in the Magistrates’/Youth Court or on indictment in the Crown Court); and indictable offences (triable only in the Crown Court). The offences of which the applicant was eventually convicted and sentenced (theft and assault occasioning actual bodily harm), were “either way” offences. If an offender is aged under 21, neither the Crown Court nor a Magistrates’ Court can pass a sentence of imprisonment, but they can pass a sentence of detention in a Young Offender institution. If the magistrates consider that their power of sentencing is inadequate, as occurred in the applicant’s case, they may commit an offender to the Crown Court for sentence. A person under 18 – a juvenile – is normally tried in a Youth Court. According to section 24(1) of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980, a juvenile must be tried in a Youth Court, subject to defined exceptions, including where the magistrates sitting in the Youth Court consider that a juvenile accused, charged with particularly serious offences, could properly be sentenced under section 53(2) and (3) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 if he were convicted on indictment (see below). In that event, the juvenile will be tried in the Crown Court. A Youth Court’s sentencing powers are less extensive than those of the Crown Court. At the time the applicant came to be sentenced, the only form of custodial sentence available to the Youth Court was detention in a Young Offender institution. Moreover, at the material time detention in a Young Offender institution was only available in respect of offenders whose age on the date of conviction (according to the Government) was 15 (as in the applicant’s case), 16 or 17. In this connection, section 1A of the Criminal Justice Act 1982 provided at the date of the applicant’s conviction: (1) Subject to section 8 below and to section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, where - “(a) an offender under 21 but not less than 15 years of age is convicted of an offence which is punishable with imprisonment in the case of a person aged 21 or over; and: (b) (...) the sentence that the court is to pass is a sentence of detention in a young offender institution.” The Youth Court was restricted to a maximum sentence of six-months’ detention in a Young Offender institution for a single offence or a total maximum of twelve months where, like the applicant, the offender was convicted of two offences triable either way. Pursuant to section 37 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980, if a Youth Court found a 15, 16 or 17 year old guilty of an indictable offence or “either way” offence (as in the applicant’s case), and it was of the opinion that the offender should be sentenced to more than six-months’ detention in a Young Offender institution (or twelve months’ detention in the case of an offender like the applicant convicted of two offences), then it could commit him to the Crown Court to be sentenced. Following committal, the Crown Court could then pass a sentence of up to 24 months’ detention in a Young Offender institution for the offence (section 1B of the Criminal Justice Act 1982), or deal with the offender in any way in which the Youth Court could have dealt with him. Detention in a Young Offender institution can only be imposed inter alia if the offence was one of violence and the court was of the opinion that only a custodial sentence would be adequate to protect the public from serious harm, or that offence was so serious that only a custodial sentence could be justified. In the case of offenders aged 14 or under (like the applicant at the date of the commission of the offences of which he was eventually charged and convicted), the Youth Court may, inter alia, impose a fine, make a compensation order or make a supervision order. It has no power in law to sentence an offender under the age of 14 to a Young Offender institution for summary or “either way” offences. In addition, it has no power to commit such children to the Crown Court for trial or for sentencing. There are exceptional circumstances in which children of 14 may receive a custodial sentence. Thus, according to section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, a young person aged between 10 and 17 may be given a custodial sentence if he is convicted of an offence, such as robbery, punishable in the case of an adult with imprisonment for 14 years or more, not being an offence the sentence for which is fixed by law. Of relevance to the applicant’s case, under section 7 of the Theft Act 1968 the maximum sentence for an adult convicted on indictment of an offence of theft is seven years’ imprisonment. Of equal relevance to the applicant’s case, under section 47 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 the maximum sentence for an adult convicted on indictment of an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm is five years’ imprisonment. According to the Government, in English law the basic rule for determining what power the court has in relation to sentencing an offender is his age at the date of conviction. The age at the date of conviction rule, as opposed to the date of sentence, was approved by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Danga ([1992] Q.B. 476) and later in R. v. Pespane (13 Cr. App. R (S) 438), R. v. Robinson (14 Cr. App. R. (S) 48) and R. v. Starkey (15 Cr. App. R. (S) 576). The applicant draws attention to his view that section 29 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1963 contradicts the age-at-the-date-of-conviction-rule. This section makes provision for defendants who reach their eighteenth birthday after their case has begun in the Youth Court. It reads: “Where proceedings in respect of a young person are begun ... for an offence and he attains the age of 18 before the conclusion of the proceedings, the court may deal with the case and make any order which it could have made had he not attained that age.” If a juvenile has not attained his or her eighteenth birthday at the time of plea, the Youth Court has the power to hear the case and impose sentence. If the defendant’s eighteenth birthday falls after the plea and before final disposal of the case, the Youth Court may nevertheless sentence the defendant as if he or she was still a juvenile. If, however the juvenile has reached age 18 by the time he or she is asked to enter a plea to the offence, the court must treat him or her as an adult (R. v. Islington North Juvenile Court, ex parte Daley [1983] AC 347). In R. v. West London Justices ex parte Siley Windit (reported in Criminal Law Review 2000, p.p. 926-927), the Divisional Court held that the relevant age for determining a juvenile accused’s right to elect for jury trial was his age on the date he entered a plea of guilty. The applicant further points out that the domestic case-law relied on by the Government is of limited value to the applicant’s case since there are no decisions dealing with the situation of a fourteen-year old who becomes fifteen before conviction and thus moves from a non-custodial to a custodial bracket.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
31,001-86578,ENG,TUR,ADMISSIBILITY,2008,GURLESEN AND OTHERS v. TURKEY,4,Inadmissible,Antonella Mularoni;Françoise Tulkens;Ireneu Cabral Barreto;Nona Tsotsoria,"The applicants, whose names and dates of birth appear in the appendix, are all Turkish nationals. They are represented before the Court by Mr K. Bayraktar, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The applicants were shareholders of a plot of land located in Keçiören, Ankara. On an unspecified date the Keçiören Municipality (hereinafter “the Municipality”) expropriated the applicants’ plot of land and paid them the sum of 7,521,210,000 Turkish liras (TRL) in compensation for expropriation. On 24 November 1998 the applicants initiated proceedings against the Municipality before the Ankara Civil Court seeking additional compensation. On 20 December 1999 the first-instance court awarded the applicants additional compensation of TRL 31,756,220,000 plus interest at the statutory rate accruing from 24 December 1998. On 8 February 2000 the applicants commenced enforcement proceedings against the Municipality. On 3 July 2000, on an appeal by the Municipality, the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment in part in respect of some of the applicants due to procedural irregularities and remitted the case to the first-instance court. On 20 February 2001 the Ankara Civil Court remedied the procedural irregularities indicated by the Court of Cassation and awarded additional compensation to the applicants on the same terms as determined in its previous judgment. On 11 June 2001 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court. Between February 2000 and June 2001 the Municipality of Keçiören made certain payments to the applicants in several instalments in the total sum of TRL 27,935,977,000. On 19 September 2003 the Ankara Enforcement Office declared that the applicants had an outstanding claim of TRL 116,518,578,000 as of that date. On 26 October 2006 the applicants signed an agreement with the Municipality whereby the latter agreed to make the outstanding payments by the end of February 2007 with the proviso that the applicants renounce 12.5% of their claims and discontinue all enforcement proceedings. The outstanding payments for additional compensation were made in January and February 2007 by the Municipality.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
32,001-5199,ENG,CHE,ADMISSIBILITY,2000,A.B. v. SWITZERLAND,4,Inadmissible,Christos Rozakis,"The applicant, a Swiss citizen born in 1939, is a pensioner residing in Basel. He is represented before the Court by Mr Joset and Ms Pauen, lawyers practising in Binningen in Switzerland. A. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 3 June 1994 the applicant entered voluntarily and for the 45th time the psychiatric university clinic in Basel on account of his mental illness. On 7 June 1994 he requested his release. In the subsequent proceedings the applicant was represented by a lawyer. On 9 June 1994 an expert member of the Psychiatric Commission (Psychiatrische Kommission) of the Canton of Basel-Stadt examined the applicant in hospital. As a result, the Psychiatric Commission authorised on 15 June 1994 his forced confinement in hospital (zwangsweise Hospitalisierung) until 21 July 1994. In its decision the Commission referred to the applicant's chronic illness, in particular his manic ideas (Wahnideen) and that he might endanger others. The Commission thereby relied on S. 397a et seq. of the Swiss Civil Code (Zivilgesetzbuch) concerning detention for welfare purposes (fürsorgerische Freiheitsentziehung; privation de liberté à des fins d’assistance; see below, Relevant domestic law and practice). On 20 July 1994 the psychiatric university clinic requested the applicant’s continuing psychiatric detention as his situation had not ameliorated. An expert member of the Psychiatric Commission again examined the applicant on 21 July 1994 and concluded that he suffered from a chronic mental illness. The expert noted that the applicant was ready to stay in the clinic until he had found a new apartment. On 25 July 1994 the Psychiatric Commission authorised, with reference to the expert’s examination of 21 July, the applicant's continuing forced confinement until he had found a new apartment or at the latest until 21 October 1994. On 5 August 1994 the applicant filed an appeal with the Court of Appeal (Appellationsgericht) of the Canton of Basel-Stadt, requesting his immediate release from the clinic or at least a finding that his stay in the clinic had been unlawful. He submitted, inter alia, that he had not been properly heard by the members of the Psychiatric Commission. The Court of Appeal transmitted the appeal on 10 August 1994 to the Psychiatric Commission which, on 23 August 1994, filed its observations. The Commission noted that the applicant had agreed to stay in the clinic until he found a new apartment; he could move about freely and also leave the clinic though he returned at night to sleep. As long as he was under medicaments there was no danger of endangering others, though this could change immediately if the medicaments were taken belatedly, or not at all. On 7 September 1994 the applicant was released from the clinic. On 15 December 1994 the Court of Appeal declared the applicant's appeal inadmissible as he had meanwhile been released and therefore lacked interest in his appeal (fehlendes Rechtsschutzinteresse). The Court thereby referred to its constant case-law. To the extent that the applicant requested compensation in view of the alleged unlawfulness of his detention, the Court noted that he had the possibility of filing a separate civil claim according to S. 429a of the Swiss Civil Code (see below, Relevant domestic law and practice). The decision of the Court of Appeal was served on 16 January 1995. On 15 February 1995 the applicant filed a public law appeal (staatsrechtliche Beschwerde) and an appeal (Berufung) with the Federal Court (Bundesgericht), claiming that he had a legal interest in his complaints, and requesting legal aid. In his appeal, he furthermore addressed the unlawfulness of his detention, in his public law appeal he complained about the length of the proceedings. In a decision dated 2 March 1995 and issued in respect of the applicant's appeal, the Federal Court dismissed his request for legal aid and imposed advance court costs of 1,500 Swiss Francs (CHF) on the applicant. The Court found in particular that the appeal lacked prospects of success as the applicant had meanwhile been released. The Court thereby referred to its case-law as well as a previous case in which it had already explained this case-law to the applicant’s lawyer. As the applicant failed to pay the court costs, the Federal Court declared the appeal inadmissible on 29 March 1995. On 3 May 1995 the Federal Court rejected the applicant's public law appeal. Insofar as the applicant complained of the length of the proceedings before the cantonal authorities, the Court found that he lacked practical interest in his appeal as he had meanwhile been released. B. Relevant domestic law and practice Under the heading “Detention for Welfare Purposes” the Swiss Civil Code lists in Sections 397a-f the grounds and procedures leading to such detention, including psychiatric detention. For instance, S. 397f provides for a “simple and speedy” (einfach und rasch) judicial procedure in which the person is, if necessary, legally represented and, in first instance, there is an oral hearing. Under a separate heading “Responsibility of Guardianship Organs” the Civil Code lists in S. 426-430 liabilities and ensuing procedures in guardianship matters. Here, S. 429a , concerning “Detention for Welfare Purposes” provides, inter alia, that “Whoever has been damaged by an unlawful deprivation of liberty is entitled to damages and, if justified by the severity of the breach, to satisfaction.” According to the case-law of the Federal Court, a complaint about unlawfulness of such detention may be raised by means of a claim for damages, but not of a public law appeal or an appeal after release from detention. For instance, in a decision of 1983 the Federal Court held: “Il est de jurisprudence que le recours de droit public exige un intérêt actuel et pratique à ce que la décision attaquée soit annulée: le Tribunal fédéral doit trancher des questions concrètes, et non pas théoriques. L’intérêt actuel nécessaire fait défaut, en particulier lorsque l’acte de l’autorité a été exécuté ou est devenu sans objet ... Toutefois, le Tribunal fédéral renonce à faire d’un tel intérêt une condition de recevabilité du recours de droit public quand cette exigence empêcherait le contrôle de la constitutionnalité d’un acte qui peut se reproduire en tout temps et qui, en raison de sa brève durée, échapperait toujours à sa censure ... En l’espèce, l’internement de la recourante a duré du 13 au 17 juin 1982. La recourante n’a dès lors plus d’intérêt actuel, puisque la mesure critiquée a pris fin. Les circonstances exceptionnelles qui permettent de renoncer à cette exigence ne sont pas réalisées. En matière de privation de liberté à des fins d’assistance, le séjour dans un établissement approprié n’est pas légalement limité à un bref laps de temps : il peut se prolonger tant que l’assistance personnelle ne peut pas être fournie d’une autre manière aux personnes indiquées à l’art. 397a CC. L’intérêt actuel peut donc exister encore au moment où le Tribunal fédéral est saisi d’un recours de droit public. On ne saurait dire que celui qui a été relaxé après une mesure de privation de liberté à des fins d’assistance a encore un intérêt actuel à former un recours de droit public parce qu’il peut se prévaloir de l’illégalité du placement pour réclamer une indemnité. L’art. 429a CC donne droit à une indemnité à titre de dommages-intérêts et de réparation morale en cas de privation illégale de liberté ...” (Arrêts du Tribunal fédéral [ATF] 109 I a 170 et seq.). This case-law also applies to other types of detention (see ATF 110 Ia 140) and was confirmed in 1999 (ATF 125 Ia 394). In the last mentioned decision, the Federal Court furthermore generally found that a person who had been released from detention can, pursuant to Article 5 § 5 of the Convention, institute separate proceedings for damages in which all complaints may be raised about the unlawfulness of detention",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
33,001-70306,ENG,POL,ADMISSIBILITY,2005,ZABOR v. POLAND,4,Inadmissible,Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant, Mr Stanisław Zabor, is a Polish national who was born in 1954 and lives in Wrocław. On an unspecified date the applicant’s mother was granted, by way of an administrative decision, a protected tenancy of an apartment located in a house owned by the municipality and subject to the compulsory management of the local housing administration. The applicant lived in this apartment since he his birth . In 1999 his brother and father, who apparently had been in conflict with the applicant, instituted proceedings to have the applicant’s name deleted from the local register of inhabitants on the ground that he did not live in the apartment. On an unspecified date the housing administration refused their request. On 13 January 2001 the applicant’s mother died. The applicant requested that the housing administration conclude a tenancy agreement with him as her mother’s legal successor in respect of the tenancy contract, as provided for by law. This was refused by a letter of 10 July 2001 on the ground that the applicant did not comply with the requirement for such a succession set out by Article 8 of the 2001 Law, since he did not live in the apartment. At the same time the housing administration instituted proceedings to delete the applicant’s registration from the list of inhabitants of the building. On 27 February 2001 the administration reiterated their refusal to conclude a tenancy agreement with him. On 17 April 2002 the Mayor of Wrocław gave a decision striking the applicant’s name from the register of inhabitants of the building concerned, considering that it transpired from the evidence that he had not been living there. On 10 June 2002 this decision was upheld. On 24 July 2002 the applicant brought a civil action against the municipality under Article 691 of the Civil Code, regulating conditions of succession to the right of lease of apartments, including protected tenancies, claiming a declaration that he was a legal successor of the former tenant of the apartment, his mother. On 6 November 2002 the Wrocław District Court, by way of a judgment in default, allowed his claim. The housing administration lodged an objection against this judgment. On 7 March 2003 the Wrocław Regional Court, having reconsidered the case, upheld the judgment and confirmed that the applicant was a successor in respect of the tenancy contract. On 5 May 2003 the applicant requested the Wrocław Municipal Office to take steps to make the judgment operational by concluding a tenancy agreement with him. In a letter of 18 July 2003 the municipality stated the following: “In reply to your letter and with reference to the attached judgment of 7 March 2003, I should inform you that under that judgment you became your mother’s successor in respect of the tenancy contract, but that it is impossible to conclude such a contract with you. This is so because an internal enquiry showed that you had not been living in that apartment on a permanent basis. This has already resulted in the decision of the Mayor striking your name out of the list of inhabitants of the building. Consequently, pursuant to Article 11 (3) 1. of the Act of 21 June 2001 on the protection of the rights of tenants, housing resources of municipalities and amendments to the Civil Code, the municipal office hereby gives six-months notice in respect of the contract which you obtained under the judgment referred to above, the contract expiring on 29 February 2004. The factual basis for the termination of contract is the fact that you have not been living in this apartment for a period longer then twelve months. “ The applicant appealed against this letter, the legal status of which was uncertain, in that it was not clear whether it was an administrative decision; he complained that the municipality had refused to comply with the final judgment of the civil court. On 2 September 2003 the Local Government Board of Appeal of the Wrocław Region informed the applicant that it was not competent in housing matters, and that the letter complained of was not an administrative decision in any event, against which an appeal to a higher authority would lie. On 9 December 2003 the applicant lodged an action with the Wrocław District Court in which he sought a declaration under Article 189 of the Code of Civil Procedure that a contractual tenancy relationship existed between him and the municipal office. These proceedings are pending. From 1945 on, housing matters were subject to a high degree of state control under successive provisions of housing legislation. The most important characteristic of this system, a so called “special lease scheme”, was that a tenancy was created by means of an administrative decision and not by a civil law contract between the landlord and the tenant. Under these protected tenancies, the tenants paid controlled rent and the owners could not terminate lease by giving notice to the tenant. The special lease scheme was also applicable to houses owned, until 1990, by the State Treasury, and after the reform of the local administration, by the municipalities. Although “the special lease scheme” was abolished under the 1994 Act, the system of protected tenancy is still applicable to tenants who were allocated their apartments on the basis of previous administrative decisions. Under transitional provisions of the 1994 Law, protected tenancies which had originated in administrative decisions given in the past under the special lease scheme were to be regarded as contractual leases concluded for an indefinite period and governed by the provisions of the 1994 Law. The 1994 Act maintained, albeit with slight modifications of wording, the rules concerning the protection of tenants against termination of leases continued on the basis of previous administrative decisions and the right of succession to a lease. Until the entry into force of the 1994 Act the right to succession of a protected tenancy was regulated by Article 691 of the Civil Code, which provided that in case of the death of a tenant, his descendants had a right of succession in respect of the tenancy, if they lived in the same apartment at the time of the original tenant’s death. The 1994 Act repealed this provision and replaced it by Article 8 of the Act, which read: “1. In case of the death of a tenant and on condition that they lived in the household of a tenant until his death, his descendants, ascendants, adult siblings, adoptive parents or adopted children and a person who has lived with a tenant in de facto marital cohabitation, shall succeed to the tenancy agreement and acquire the tenant’s rights and obligations connected with [the lease of] the flat, unless they relinquish that right to the landlord. This provision does not apply to persons who, when the [original] tenant died, had title to another residential dwelling. 2. In cases where there is no successor to the tenancy agreement, or where the successors have relinquished their right, the lease shall expire.” In 2001 parliament adopted a new law governing housing matters and relations between landlords and tenants. The Act of 21 June 2001 on the protection of the rights of tenants, housing resources of municipalities and amendments to the Civil Code (Ustawa o ochronie praw lokatorów, mieszkaniowym zasobie gminy i o zmianie Kodeksu cywilnego) (“the 2001 Act”) entered into force on 10 July 2001. It repealed the 1994 Act and reinserted Article 691 into the Civil Code. Under Article 11 (3) 1 of that Act, the owner of apartment can give six-months notice on the tenancy contract if the tenant has not been living in that apartment for more than twelve months. The obligation for Polish citizens residing in Poland to register their permanent address in a municipality’s register of inhabitants is stipulated in Article 5 of the National Identity Cards and Registration of Persons Act 1974 (Ustawa o ewidencji ludności i dowodach osobistych z 10.04.1974). Under Article 6 of the 1974 Act, the notion of “living permanently” implies residing at a given address with the intention of making it the principal centre of one’s vital interests. Article 9 (2) of the 1974 Act provided that: “a person applying to have their permanent or temporary residence registered shall submit a certificate to the effect that they are entitled to stay in the apartment (or other dwelling premises) concerned.” On 27 May 2002 the Polish Constitutional Court declared Article 9 (2) of the 1974 Act unconstitutional and, subsequently, this provision was repealed with effect from 19 June 2002. As a result of the judgment of the Constitutional Court, a certificate to the effect that a person is entitled – within the civil law sense of the term - to stay in an apartment is no longer a prerequisite for having his permanent or temporary residence registered.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
34,001-82107,ENG,ARM,ADMISSIBILITY,2007,KHANYAN v. ARMENIA,4,Inadmissible,Corneliu Bîrsan;David Thór Björgvinsson,"The applicant, Ms Alyona Khanyan, is an Armenian national who was born in 1977 and lives in Yerevan. The applicant was a refugee from Azerbaijan who fled to Armenia in 1990. In accordance with a number of governmental decisions, the applicant – together with other refugees – was placed in a flat in a building previously owned by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and used as the Party’s graduate school. On an unspecified date, the applicant instituted proceedings against the Yerevan Mayor’s Office (Երևանի քաղաքապետարան) seeking to obtain title to the above flat. She claimed that the flat was ownerless and that she had bona fide, manifestly and continuously been in possession of the flat for ten years, which entitled her to acquire ownership of it in accordance with Article 187 of the Civil Code. The Governmental Department for the Management of Public Property (ՀՀ կառավարությանն առընթեր պետական գույքի կառավարման վարչություն) was also joined as a defendant. On 28 April 2004 the Kentron and Nork-Marash District Court of Yerevan (Երևան քաղաքի Կենտրոն և Նորք-Մարաշ համայնքների առաջին ատյանի դատարան) granted the applicant’s claim. No appeal was lodged, so this judgment became final and enforceable on 13 May 2004. On 27 May 2004 the applicant’s title was formally registered and the relevant ownership certificate was provided to her. On an unspecified date, the Deputy General Prosecutor (ՀՀ գլխավոր դատախազի տեղակալ) lodged a cassation appeal on points of law against this judgment with the Court of Cassation (ՀՀ վճռաբեկ դատարան), in accordance with Article 223 § 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. On 17 September 2004 the Court of Cassation granted the appeal and quashed the judgment of 28 April 2004. The Court of Cassation found that the flat in question, in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Soviet of Armenia of 17 April 1991 and the Law on Public Property, was in State ownership and, therefore, the applicant was not entitled to acquire ownership under Article 187 of the Civil Code. The case was remitted to the Civil Court of Appeal (ՀՀ քաղաքացիական գործերով վերաքննիչ դատարան) for a new examination. On 13 October 2004 the Civil Court of Appeal examined the applicant’s claim anew. The applicant and the two defendants, namely the Yerevan Mayor’s Office and the Governmental Department for the Management of Public Property, made their submissions. Having heard the parties, the Court of Appeal decided to dismiss the applicant’s claim on the ground that she had failed to provide evidence of bona fide, manifest and continuous possession of the flat in question. The applicant lodged a cassation appeal on points of law and procedure. On 26 November 2004 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s cassation appeal on the ground that the flat in question was in State ownership and was in the possession of the applicant not as her own property but as a temporary place of residence. According to Article 37, public authorities are entitled to institute court proceedings seeking to defend the pecuniary interests of the State. The public authority which has instituted proceedings enjoys all the rights of a plaintiff and bears his responsibilities. If the relevant public authority does not institute proceedings, the proceedings seeking to defend the pecuniary interests of the State shall be instituted by the public prosecutor in accordance with the Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office. According to Article 140, judgments of first instance courts enter into force fifteen days after their delivery. According to Article 205, appeals against judgments of first instance courts which have not entered into force can be brought by the parties and persons who were not parties to the proceedings but whose rights and obligations were affected by the judgment. According to Articles 206 and 207, such appeals can be brought within fifteen days after the delivery of the judgment of the first instance court and are examined by the Civil Court of Appeal. According to Article 219, judgments of the Court of Appeal enter into force fifteen days after their delivery. According to Article 223 § 1, appeals against judgments of the Court of Appeal which have not entered into force can be brought by the parties and persons who were not parties to the proceedings but whose rights and obligations were affected by the judgment. According to Article 222 § 1, judgments of first instance courts and the Court of Appeal which have entered into force can be reviewed through cassation proceedings. According to Article 223 § 2, appeals against judgments of first instance courts and the Court of Appeal which have entered into force may be brought by (1) the General Prosecutor of Armenia and his deputies in cases prescribed by Article 37 of this Code and in accordance with the Law on the Public Prosecutor’s Office; and (2) advocates holding a special licence and registered with the Court of Cassation. According to Article 224, cassation appeals shall be examined by the Civil and Commercial Chamber of the Court of Cassation. According to Article 225, a cassation appeal can be lodged on (1) points of law or a procedural violation of the parties’ rights; or (2) on the ground of newly discovered circumstances. A cassation appeal on the ground envisaged by the first paragraph of this Article can be lodged within three months from the date of entry into force of the judgment. According to Articles 235 and 236, the Court of Cassation shall review the judgments on the basis of the grounds presented in the appeal. The Court can either dismiss the appeal, or otherwise quash the whole or part of the judgment and remit the case for a new examination by the Court of Appeal. According to Articles 237 and 238, the Court of Cassation shall adopt a decision. The Court of Cassation is not entitled to establish or consider as proven circumstances which have not been established by the contested judgment or have been rejected by it, to determine whether or not this or that piece of evidence is trustworthy, to resolve the issue of one piece of evidence having more weight than another or the issue of which norm of substantive law must be applied and what kind of judgment must be adopted upon the new examination of the case. According to Article 239, the decision of the Court of Cassation enters into force from the moment of its delivery and is not subject to appeal. According to Article 241, a copy of this decision shall be sent to the appellant, to the parties and to the relevant court within seven days from its adoption. According to Article 27, where a violation of pecuniary interests of the State has been disclosed, the public prosecutor or, upon his instruction, the relevant public authority or public official shall institute court proceedings. According to Article 28, the General Prosecutor can lodge appeals against court judgments and decisions according to the relevant rules of criminal and civil procedure. Such appeals can be also lodged by the subordinate prosecutors within the limits of their competence. The public prosecutor is entitled to ask the court for the case file of any case in which a final judgment or a decision has been taken. The public prosecutor, if he considers the court judgment or decision to be unlawful or unsubstantiated, shall lodge an appeal with the superior court. According to Article 178, a property is considered ownerless if it has no owner or its owner is unknown or has renounced his ownership in respect of that property. Ownership of an ownerless immovable property can be obtained by virtue of adverse possession (Article 187). According to Article 187, a citizen or a legal person, who is not the owner of an immovable property but has bona fide, manifestly and continuously possessed it as his own property for a period of ten years, shall obtain ownership in respect of that property (adverse possession).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
35,001-85949,ENG,CZE,ADMISSIBILITY,2008,KAFKA v. THE CZECH REPUBLIC,4,Inadmissible,Isabelle Berro-Lefèvre;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Snejana Botoucharova,"The applicant, Mr Petr Kafka, is a Czech national who was born in 1949 and lives in Varnsdorf. The Czech Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr V.A. Schorm, from the Ministry of Justice. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 1. Proceedings nos. 4 C 419/86 and 4 C 166/90 On 5 June 1986 the applicant’s father brought proceedings before the Tábor District Court (okresní soud) against an agricultural cooperative. The proceedings terminated in the claimant’s favour. On 31 May 1990 the Supreme Court (Nejvyšší soud), upon a complaint by the former Prosecutor General, alleging a breach of law (stížnost pro porušení zákona), quashed the judgments of the lower courts and sent the case back to the District Court. In October 1991 the claimant specified his court expenses of CZK 70,010 (EUR 2,728) which included a sum of CZK 68,600 (EUR 2,673) corresponding to damage caused by the courts’ judgments. According to the Government, when presenting his final pleadings, the applicant qualified the amount of CZK 70,010 as court fees. 2. Proceedings no. 6 C 55/94 On 8 March 1994 the applicant’s father brought proceedings against the same cooperative for reimbursement of court fees. In the course of the proceedings, he extended his action seeking to order the cooperative to pay him CZK 70,010 in respect of his court expenses. His action was dismissed. According to the Government, the proceedings finally terminated on 9 February 1995. 3. Proceedings no. 4 C 83/95 On 20 October 1995 a certain Z. brought an action in the District Court against the applicant’s father seeking to be paid CZK 5,400 (EUR 210) for legal services he had provided. On 10 May 1996 the District Court ordered the applicant’s father to pay the sum in question. The latter appealed and filed a counterclaim of CZK 7,179 (EUR 280). On 13 December 1996 the České Budějovice Regional Court (krajský soud) upheld this judgment, separating the counterclaim for a separate hearing (no. 4 C 291/97). On 22 December 1996 the applicant’s father died. Inheritance proceedings were instituted. On 20 November 1997 the Constitutional Court (Ústavní soud) declared manifestly ill-founded the applicant’s constitutional appeal (ústavní stížnost) challenging the judgments of the lower courts. On 8 March 2001 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s second constitutional appeal which was directed against the same judgments. It stated, inter alia, that in respect of his claim relating to the manner of which the lower courts had considered the sum of CZK 68,600, the applicant’s father had died and that the applicant was not a party to these proceedings. 4. Proceedings no. 4 C 291/97 On 9 April 1999 inheritance proceedings concerning the applicant’s father’s estate terminated. The applicant as the only heir expressed his wish to continue pursuing the proceedings before the District Court in his late father’s stead. On 27 September 1999 the District Court dismissed the counterclaim filed by the applicant’s father. On 1 June 2000 the Regional Court partly quashed this judgment and remitted the relevant part of the case back to the District Court which, on 20 September 2000, again dismissed the counterclaim. On 10 May 2001 the Regional Court upheld this judgment. On 8 November 2001 the Constitutional Court rejected a limine the applicant’s constitutional appeal. On 22 January 2004 the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal on points of law (dovolání). The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the allegedly excessive length of judicial proceedings are set out in the Court’s decision in the case of Vokurka v. Czech Republic, no. 40552/02 (dec.), §§ 11-24, 16 October 2007).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
36,001-4928,ENG,GBR,ADMISSIBILITY,1999,McPARLAND v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,4,Inadmissible,Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant is an Irish citizen, born in 1946 and living in Newry, Northern Ireland. He is represented before the Court by Mr Gerard Trainor of the Elliot-Trainor Partnership, a firm of solicitors based in Newry. A.  On 3 April 1998 the Transport Licensing and Enforcement Branch of the Department of the Environment of Northern Ireland (“the Department”) notified the applicant in writing that his application for a road service licence had been refused on the ground that he was not considered to be of “good repute” within the meaning of sections 28A(1)(a) and 46A(3A)(a) of the Transport Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 as amended. The Department’s refusal was based on the fact that the applicant was convicted on 1 June 1990 of possessing explosives, firearms and ammunition and sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment. The applicant was released on 7 March 1995. Following a hearing held on 19 May 1998 before the Vehicle Licensing Review Body (“the Review Body”), the Department informed the applicant in June 1998 that it had accepted the Review Body’s recommendation and had decided to uphold its decision of 3 April 1998. The applicant’s solicitor requested the Department to provide reasons for the Review Body’s decision. By letter dated 7 August 1998, the Department informed the applicant that the Review Body had met on 19 May 1998 to hear his appeal and had taken into account all the information before it, including the character references which the applicant had supplied. It was the Review Body’s unanimous recommendation that the Department’s initial decision be upheld. The Department drew the applicant’s attention to the fact that the Review Body was an independent institution which did not have any power to take decisions on appeals from its licensing authority. The Review Body’s functions were limited to making recommendations for consideration by the Department. The Department took a final decision on the applicant’s application in which it affirmed its licensing authority’s earlier decision to refuse him an operator’s licence on the grounds specified in its letter of 3 April 1998. The applicant subsequently sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Department’s decision on the grounds inter alia that the decision refusing him a licence was discriminatory, unreasonable, unfair and unlawful; that the licensing authority had given undue emphasis to his criminal conviction; and that the same authority had failed to take into account relevant matters such as the character references he had submitted, his qualifications and the fact that official and private agencies had earmarked funding for the business venture which he was attempting to mount. The applicant also prayed in aid the provisions on the rehabilitation of offenders following their release from prison. On 25 September 1998 the applicant’s lawyer informed the High Court of Northern Ireland that the applicant no longer wished to proceed with the leave application. Mr Justice Kerr accordingly dismissed the application. According to the applicant, Mr Justice Kerr stated at the leave hearing that the licensing authorities confronted as they were with the applicant’s previous conviction and the terms of the relevant domestic legislation could not have reached a different conclusion. B. Relevant domestic law Section 28 of the Transport Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 was amended by regulation 4 of the Road Transport (Qualifications of Operators) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1977 so as to provide that the Department of the Environment shall refuse to grant to an applicant an operator’s licence unless it is satisfied that the applicant is, inter alia, of good repute (new section 28A). The Transport Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 was further amended by the Road Transport (Qualifications of Operators) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1991. According to section 5(2) of the Regulations, the Department shall determine that a person is not of good repute if he has been convicted of serious offences, defined as any offence which carries a sentence of imprisonment for a term exceeding three months, a fine exceeding level 4 on the standard scale, or a community service order for more than 60 hours. Spent convictions are to be disregarded. A person who has been refused a licence may apply in writing within fourteen days from the date of issue of the notice of refusal to the Department of the Environment stating his grounds of complaint and requiring the decision to be reviewed by the Department. The Department must inform the applicant in writing whether the decision has been confirmed or reversed. The Department must give reasons for the confirmation of a decision (regulation 5 of the Road Service Licensing Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1989).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
37,001-90500,ENG,GBR,ADMISSIBILITY,2008,K.R.S. v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,3,Inadmissible,David Thór Björgvinsson;Ján Šikuta;Lech Garlicki;Mihai Poalelungi;Nicolas Bratza;Päivi Hirvelä,"The applicant, Mr K.R.S., is an Iranian national who was born in 1975 and lives in Harmondsworth. He was represented before the Court by Mr K. Murphy, a lawyer practising in Woodford Green, London, with Scudamore Solicitors. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms H. Upton of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The applicant arrived in the United Kingdom on 11 November 2006 and claimed asylum. It was discovered that the applicant had travelled through Greece before arriving in the United Kingdom. As a consequence, a request was made to Greece for it to accept responsibility for the applicant's asylum claim. Greece accepted responsibility on 12 December 2006. On 14 December 2006 the Secretary of State declined to give substantive consideration to the applicant's asylum claim because under the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc) Act 2004 (“the 2004 Act”: see domestic law and practice below) the applicant could be returned to Greece. The applicant subsequently absconded and later was detained in an immigration enforcement operation. Directions were then set for the applicant's removal to Greece at 8.20 a.m. on 23 May 2008. On 15 May 2008 the applicant's representatives wrote to the Secretary of State for the Home Department requesting that removal be deferred pending the outcome of the R (Nasseri) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] EWCA Civ 464 (see domestic law and practice below). The Court of Appeal had given judgment in that case on 14 May 2008 and it appeared that the unsuccessful party, Nasseri, was to petition the House of Lords for leave to appeal. On 15 May 2008 the Secretary of State responded that the applicant had failed to identify how Nasseri applied to his case. The Secretary of State said that the concerns that had been expressed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and others about Greek procedures related to “interrupted” cases, cases where the applicant left Greece before their asylum claim was decided and where there was a risk that an asylum applicant might not be readmitted into the asylum process in Greece. The present applicant's case did not fall into this category. He was being returned to Greece having originally entered the territory of the EU through that country. There had been no criticism regarding access to the Greek asylum system in those cases. On the same day the applicant's solicitors responded that there was nothing in the Court of Appeal's judgment in Nasseri that suggested it had proceeded on the basis that it was merely considering “interrupted” cases. No response was received from the Secretary of State. On 21 May 2008, the applicant brought judicial review proceedings challenging the decision to remove him to Greece. The removal directions set for 23 May 2008 were cancelled. In her acknowledgment of service contesting the judicial review proceedings, the Secretary of State relied on the Court of Appeal's judgment in Nasseri that the relevant provisions of the 2004 Act were not incompatible with the investigative obligation under Article 3 of the Convention and that, upon an examination of all of the evidence in relation to Greek practices and procedures, there was no evidence of a risk of unlawful refoulement to Greece. Furthermore there were no proceedings pending before the House of Lords in Nasseri. On 16 June 2008, the High Court refused the applicant permission to apply for judicial review for the reasons set out in the Secretary of State's acknowledgment of service. Removal directions to Greece were then reset for 14 July 2008. On 10 July 2008 the applicant lodged an application with this Court. On 11 July 2008, the President of the Section to which the case had been allocated decided to apply Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, indicating to the Government that it was desirable in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings that the applicant should not be expelled to Greece pending the Court's decision. In his letter informing the Agent of the Government of the United Kingdom of this decision, the Section Registrar stated: “This indication has been made in light of the UNHCR report dated 15 April 2008 (a copy of which is attached). The parties' attention is drawn to paragraph 26 of the report that states that 'In view of EU Member States' obligation to ensure access to fair and effective asylum procedures, including in cases subject to the Dublin Regulation, UNHCR advises Governments to refrain from returning asylum seekers to Greece under the Dublin Regulation until further notice. UNHCR recommends that Governments make use of Article 3(2) of the Dublin Regulation, allowing States to examine an asylum application lodged even if such examination is not its responsibility under the criteria as laid down in this Regulation'. The Acting President has instructed me to inform you that the Rule 39 measure will remain in force pending confirmation from your authorities that the applicant, if removed to Greece and if he so wishes, will have ample opportunity in Greece to apply to the Court for a Rule 39 measure in the event of his onward expulsion from Greece to Iran. Your authorities may wish to avail themselves of any bilateral arrangements under the Dublin Convention with a view to seeking such confirmation.” “UK Border Agency (UKBA) has been advised by the Head of the Greek Dublin Unit that Asylum seekers returned to Greece under the Dublin Regulation [see relevant international and European Union law below] are given the opportunity to lodge an asylum claim on arrival. If they do so they are kept in a holding centre for up to 2 days while their application is registered. They are then provided with a 'pink' card which entitles them to work and to access benefits while their application is considered. Furthermore, no asylum seeker is returned by the Greek authorities to such countries as Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Sudan or Eritrea, even if their asylum application is rejected by the Greek authorities. In this event they are given a letter telling them to leave Greece within a specified time but no action is then taken to enforce their removal...UKBA has written to the Greek Dublin Unit for written confirmation of the above and express confirmation that the opportunity to apply for asylum extends equally to the opportunity to make an application to the Court and a reply is expected within two weeks. Furthermore, it is standard practice in Dublin Regulation removal cases to Greece for the United Kingdom to obtain from the Greek authorities clarification that the individual concerned will be able to submit an asylum application upon arrival in Greece should he or she wish to do so.” “In general, no alien who submits an asylum application is put in detention for that sole reason. In any case, the expulsion procedure that regards illegal aliens or asylum applicants, who were firstly arrested for illegal entry, is going through various stages of remedy (administrative or judicial) [sic]. No asylum applicant is expelled, unless all the stages of the asylum procedure are finished and all the legal rights for review have been exhausted, according to the provisions of the Geneva Convention and the non refoulement clause. Furthermore, according to the Procedural Rules of the European Court of Human Rights, they have the right to appeal against any expulsion decision and have a Rule 39 indication on their case.” In his reply of 6 August 2008, the Section Registrar sought confirmation that, according to the terms of the letter of 11 July 2008, the Greek authorities not only ensured the right of an asylum applicant returned to Greece to apply for a Rule 39 measure but also guarantee him ample opportunity to avail himself of that right while still on the territory of Greece. The Agent of the Government of the United Kingdom in turn sought such confirmation from the Agent of the Government of Greece. On 12 November 2008, the United Kingdom Agent forwarded a letter dated 4 November 2008 from the Greek Agent. This stated: “We hereby advise you that it is the objective of the Greek State, though its competent bodies and in accordance with the current legal framework (Presidential Decrees 220/2007, 90/2008 and 96/2008), to ensure the unhindered submission of applications for asylum by all aliens who declare before any Greek Authority, at the entry points or on Greek territory, either verbally or in writing, that they request asylum in our country or ask in any way not to be deported to other countries from fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, social class or political views. Consequently, in Greece not only is there the right and the possibility to submit an application for asylum, but the actual application is also examined very carefully, exhaustively and as to substance...the Police Office, as the competent authority, makes much of the 'right for asylum' and the principle of non-refoulement, and they do not deport the alien from our country, if the procedure has not been completed. This also applies for the aliens transferred to Greece, pursuant to the provisions of the Dublin Regulation, provided that the requirements for the characterization of the 'applicant' as a national of a third country or a non-citizen who has submitted an application for asylum for which a final decision has not yet been made are met, as described in the Directive 2005/85/EK [Council Directive 2005/85/EC of 1 December 2005 on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status – see relevant European Union law below] and Presidential Decree 90/2008” This letter enclosed another letter dated 31 October 2008 from the Directorate for Aliens Affairs to that effect. Attached to the letter of 31 October was a note which referred to the fact that many applicants resisting return to Greece had the right to submit asylum applications in Greece but had not done so because their purpose was to go to other European Union countries. The note also referred to the new legislative framework in Greece, which, inter alia, made provision for: the Public Prosecutor to oversee the implementation of the relevant domestic law in respect of aliens who are minors, without the need for an asylum application by them; training for the officials responsible; the right to immediate employment and education; the issuing of travel documents for beneficiaries of subsidiary protection and “applicants for international protection”; and the ipso jure revocation of all decisions in respect of “interrupted claims”. The Dublin Convention (the Convention determining the State responsible for examining applications for asylum lodged in one of the Member States of the European Communities, 15 June 1990) provided for measures to ensure that applicants for asylum had their applications examined by one of the Member States and that applicants for asylum were not referred successively from one Member State to another. Articles 4 to 8 set out the criteria for determining the single Member State responsible for examining an application for asylum. Pursuant to Article 7, the responsibility for examining an application for asylum is incumbent upon the Member State responsible for controlling the entry of the alien into the territory of the Member States. The United Kingdom and Greece were both signatory States. The Convention has been superseded by Council Regulation (EC) No 343/2003 of 18 February 2003 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national (“Dublin II”, hereinafter “the Dublin Regulation). The Dublin Regulation applies to all European Union Member States, Norway and Iceland. Article 3(1) of the Regulation provides for asylum applications to be examined by a single Member State, according to the criteria set out in Chapter III. The criteria for determining which Member State is responsible include where it is established that an asylum seeker has irregularly crossed the border into a Member State, having come from a third country (Article 10). If responsibility can be designated on the basis of the criteria, listed in Chapter III, Article 11 provides that the first Member State with which the application for asylum was lodged shall be responsible for examining it. Article (3)2 of the Dublin Regulation allows a Member State to examine an asylum application even if such examination is not its responsibility. It provides: “By way of derogation from paragraph 1, each Member State may examine an application for asylum lodged with it by a third-country national, even if such examination is not its responsibility under the criteria laid down in this Regulation. In such an event, that Member State shall become the Member State responsible within the meaning of this Regulation and shall assume the obligations associated with that responsibility. Where appropriate, it shall inform the Member State previously responsible, the Member State conducting a procedure for determining the Member State responsible or the Member State which has been requested to take charge of or take back the applicant.” The rights and standards set out in Directive 2005/85/EC include: the right to remain in a Member State pending the examination of an asylum application (Article 7); that decisions on applications are given in writing and, where an application is rejected, that the reasons in fact and law are stated in the decision with information on how to challenge a negative decision (Article 9); that each applicant for asylum be given appropriate linguistic assistance and a personal interview (Articles 10 and 12); and, subject to a number of qualifications, that applicants shall have the right to legal assistance and representation (Article 15). Article 39 guarantees applicants the right to an effective remedy before a court or tribunal against decisions taken against them. Member States are to allow the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees access to applicants, access to information on individual applications and the opportunity to present its views to any competent authorities (Article 21). The above Directive requires that Member States ensure a dignified standard of living to all asylum-seekers, paying specific attention to the situation of applicants with special needs or who are detained. It regulates matters such as the provision of information, documentation, freedom of movement, healthcare, accommodation, schooling of minors, access to the labour market and to vocational training. It also covers standards for persons with special needs, minors, unaccompanied children and victims of torture. In a judgment given on 19 April 2007 in Commission v. Greece (Case C-72/06), the Court of Justice of the European Communities (“the ECJ”) found that Greece had failed to implement the Directive. It appears from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Position Paper (set out below) that it has now done so. Pursuant to the Dublin Regulation, Part 2 of Schedule 3 to the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc) Act 2004 establishes a “first list of safe countries” which covers the other twenty-four European Union Member States at the time (prior to the accession of Romania and Bulgaria), Norway and Iceland. Paragraph 3 of Part 2 of Schedule 3 provides: “(1) This paragraph applies for the purposes of the determination by any person, tribunal or court whether a person who has made an asylum claim or a human rights claim may be removed— (a) from the United Kingdom, and (b) to a State of which he is not a national or citizen. (2) A State to which this Part applies shall be treated, in so far as relevant to the question mentioned in sub-paragraph (1), as a place— (a) where a person's life and liberty are not threatened by reason of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, (b) from which a person will not be sent to another State in contravention of his Convention rights, and (c) from which a person will not be sent to another State otherwise than in accordance with the Refugee Convention.” Sections 1(4) and 3(2) of the Immigration Act 1971 provide for the making of Immigration Rules by the Secretary of State. Paragraph 345 of the Immigration Rules states: “(1) In a case where the Secretary of State is satisfied that the conditions set out in Paragraphs 4 and 5(1), 9 and 10(1), 14 and 15(1) or 17 of Schedule 3 to the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 are fulfilled, he will normally decline to examine the asylum application substantively and issue a certificate under Part 2, 3, 4 or 5 of Schedule 3 to the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 as appropriate. (2) The Secretary of State shall not issue a certificate under Part 2, 3, 4 or 5 of Schedule 3 to the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 unless: (i) the asylum applicant has not arrived in the United Kingdom directly from the country in which he claims to fear persecution and has had an opportunity at the border or within the third country or territory to make contact with the authorities of that third country or territory in order to seek their protection; or (ii) there is other clear evidence of his admissibility to a third country or territory. Provided that he is satisfied that a case meets these criteria, the Secretary of State is under no obligation to consult the authorities of the third country or territory before the removal of an asylum applicant to that country or territory.” In the above case, the High Court had concluded that paragraph 3 of Part 2 of Schedule 3 was incompatible with Article 3 because it precluded both the Secretary of State and the court from considering any question as to the law and practice on refoulement in Greece. The Secretary of State successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal. Laws LJ (who delivered the leading judgment) considered the extent to which the evidence demonstrated that removal of an asylum seeker to Greece would violate the United Kingdom's obligations under Article 3. He concluded that: “There are clearly concerns about the conditions in which asylum-seekers may be detained in Greece. It is not however shown that they give rise to systematic violations of Article 3. ...such evidence as there is, and in particular the recent UNHCR Paper, shows that the relevant legal procedures are to say the least shaky, although there has been some improvement. ...But in truth there are currently no deportations or removals to Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Somalia or Sudan, and as I understand it no reports of unlawful refoulement to any destination. That seems to me to be critical. I would accordingly hold, on the evidence before us, that as matters stand Greece's continued presence on the list does not offend the United Kingdom's Convention obligations.” In H (Iran); Zego (Eritrea); Kadir (Iraq) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] EWCA 985 the Court of Appeal affirmed its judgment in Nasseri. Recommendation R (97) 22 (containing guidelines on the application of the safe third country concept) where relevant provides as follows: “1. In order to assess whether a country is a safe third country to which an asylum-seeker can be sent, all the criteria indicated below should be met in each individual case: a. observance by the third country of international human rights standards relevant to asylum as established in universal and regional instruments, including compliance with the prohibition of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; b. observance by the third country of international principles relating to the protection of refugees as embodied in the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, with special regard to the principle of non-refoulement; c. the third country will provide effective protection against refoulement and the possibility to seek and enjoy asylum; d. the asylum-seeker has already been granted effective protection in the third country or has had the opportunity, at the border or within the territory of the third country, to make contact with that country's authorities in order to seek protection there before moving on to the member state where the asylum request is lodged or, that as a result of personal circumstances of the asylum-seeker, including his or her prior relations with the third country, there is clear evidence of the admissibility of the asylum-seeker to the third country.” In Recommendation R (98) 13 (on the right of rejected asylum seekers to an effective remedy against decisions on expulsion in the context of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights) the Committee of Ministers recommended: “[T]hat governments of member states, while applying their own procedural rules, ensure that the following guarantees are complied with in their legislation or practice: 1. An effective remedy before a national authority should be provided for any asylum seeker, whose request for refugee status is rejected and who is subject to expulsion to a country about which that person presents an arguable claim that he or she would be subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 2. In applying paragraph 1 of this recommendation, a remedy before a national authority is considered effective when: 2.1. that authority is judicial; or, if it is a quasi-judicial or administrative authority, it is clearly identified and composed of members who are impartial and who enjoy safeguards of independence; 2.2. that authority has competence both to decide on the existence of the conditions provided for by Article 3 of the Convention and to grant appropriate relief; 2.3. the remedy is accessible for the rejected asylum seeker; and 2.4. the execution of the expulsion order is suspended until a decision under 2.2 is taken.” The above recommendation (on measures of detention of asylum seekers) contains, inter alia, a number of recommendations on the conditions of detention of asylum seekers, which include ensuring a standard of living adequate for their health and well-being; separate accommodation within detention facilities between men and women, as well as between children and adults; a right of access to the UNHCR; legal assistance; and appropriate arrangements for minors. In Resolution 1471 (2005) (Accelerated asylum procedures in Council of Europe member states) the Parliamentary Assembly invited the governments of the member states to ensure, inter alia, that minimum procedural safeguards were met in accelerated asylum procedures, including the right to an individual determination of one's claim and the right to an effective remedy under Article 13 of the Convention. It also called on Member States to provide adequate social and medical assistance in places of detention. On 8 February 2008 the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“the CPT”) published its report on it visit to Greece from 20 to 27 February 2007. Having reviewed the conditions of detention for asylum seekers, the report recommended: The report stated: “With respect to all the centres visited, the CPT calls upon the Greek authorities to ensure that: - repair work is carried out immediately so that:  all centres have functioning toilet and shower facilities with a constant supply of water, at an appropriate temperature;  appropriate artificial lighting is installed, and access to natural light and ventilation improved. - all detainees are allocated a bed/plinth and provided with a clean mattress and clean bedding; - occupancy rates be revised so as to offer a minimum of 4m² of space per detainee; - all detainees are provided with the necessary products and equipment to keep their accommodation clean, as well as with products for personal hygiene (i.e. toilet paper, soap, toothpaste, toothbrush, etc.); - all detainees have unimpeded access to toilet facilities; - all detainees are allowed to spend a large proportion of the day outside their cells and have at least one hour of outdoor exercise a day. (emphasis in original)” The Committee also noted that there was no regime offering purposeful activities to detainees, that staffing arrangements in the detention facilities were totally inadequate and that proper health care services had to be provided to detainees. IV. RELEVANT OBJECTIVE INFORMATION On 15 April 2008, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees published the above paper in which it advised the European Union Member States to refrain from returning asylum seekers to Greece under the Dublin Regulation until further notice. It also recommended that they make use of Article 3(2) of the Dublin Regulation (see relevant European Union law above) and examine asylum applications themselves. The Position Paper criticised reception procedures for “Dublin returnees” at Athens airport and the Central Police Asylum Department, which was responsible for registering asylum appeals. It also expressed concerns in respect of those whose asylum claims were deemed to be “interrupted” as a result of their having left Greece before their claims had been decided: “While a number of positive changes in the practice have been noticed in 2007, the legal framework underpinning the practice of 'interruption' continues to leave room for different interpretations and fails to guarantee that 'Dublin returnees' with 'interrupted claims' are granted access to the procedure. This situation calls into question whether 'Dublin returnees' will have access to an effective remedy as foreseen by Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights as well as Article 39 of the Asylum Procedures Directive [Council Directive 2005/85/EC of 1 December 2005 on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status – see relevant European Union law above]. Of relevance is the decision taken by the European Commission on 31 January 2008 to refer a case to the European Court of Justice against Greece for the infringement of the Dublin Regulation based on Greece's failure to enact legislative amendments to abolish the practice of 'interruption'. (footnotes omitted)” The Position Paper also characterised the percentage of asylum seekers who were granted refugee status as “disturbingly low” and criticised the quality of asylum decisions, noting in particular their short, standardised format and the absence of legal reasoning in some decisions. The Position Paper also noted that since the adverse finding of the ECJ in Commission v. Greece (see above), Council Directive 2003/9/EC had been transposed into Greek law on 13 November 2007. However, its implementation continued to present serious flaws. The paper stated: “UNHCR remains concerned about the extremely limited reception facilities for asylum-seekers as this situation is seriously compromising the full implementation of the Presidential Decree on the Reception Conditions and urges the Government of Greece to promptly issue the awaited ministerial decision that should establish the criteria for the provision of a daily financial allowance. Furthermore, UNHCR calls upon the Government of Greece to ensure that the situation of children is given primary consideration and that the current reception conditions for unaccompanied minors are urgently reviewed.” On 9 April 2008 three non-governmental organisations, the Norwegian Organisation for Asylum Seekers, the Norwegian Helsinki Committee and Greek Helsinki Monitor, published a report entitled “A gamble with the right to asylum in Europe-Greek asylum policy and the Dublin 2 Regulation”. The report called on other European countries to apply Article 3(2) of the Dublin Regulation and on the Greek authorities to review their asylum policy so that it complied with Greece's international obligations. The report stated: “Greek asylum policy is better understood if one considers the following: 1. Keeping asylum seekers in police custody is a common practice, and we were told several stories of asylum seekers being abused while detained by the police. It is unacceptable that some of those fleeing from persecution in their home country are beaten up by the police in an EU state instead of receiving help and protection. 2. 25,113 asylum applications were submitted in 2007, but the authorities have dedicated very limited resources to handle them, which is yet another example of Greece's reluctance to deal with asylum according to its international obligations. 3. From more than 20,000 asylum cases that were given first instance examination in 2007 only 8 persons were given residence permit, 0.04 per cent of the applicants. 17,000 decisions were appealed, of which 6,448 were examined. Only 155 applications were granted, after the examination of appeals, that is 2.4 per cent. These are depressing figures. 4. Very few asylum seekers are given legal assistance in Greece, even if they are entitled to this. Access to legal assistance is all the more important given the low percentage of applications that are granted. The number of lawyers to whom NGOs mediate access, approximately 15, is not in proportion to the need. 5. Unaccompanied minors are not guaranteed a place at a reception centre, nor education, a legal guardian or other assistance they are entitled to through the UN Children's Convention. 6. Approximately 750 available places at reception centres are far from sufficient. The majority of asylum seekers are left to fend for themselves, as best they can. It is impossible to respect the asylum seekers' legal protection and fundamental social rights with resources as limited as those made available by Greek authorities. For instance, only 10-12 police officers are assigned to interview more than 20,000 asylum seekers arriving in Greece in the course of a year. The asylum interviews are therefore very short and superficial. Most of the asylum seekers we have talked to told us that authorities used between two and five minutes to interview them, and that the grounds for seeking asylum were not the main topic. Furthermore, these were among the lucky ones who got access to the asylum procedure at all, for it is difficult for asylum seekers to even lodge an application for asylum in Greece. ... In our opinion the deficiencies in the Greek asylum process, documented through this report, entail that there is a discord between the preconditions on which the Dublin II Regulation was founded and procedural practices followed in Greece. In our opinion the Greek system does not guarantee even minimum basic legal protection for the asylum seekers.” In a press release dated 28 February 2008 and entitled “No place for an asylum-seeker in Greece”, Amnesty International stated: “Greece must urgently improve the current situation for refugees and asylum-seekers in the country. We call on the Greek authorities to comply with their obligations under international human rights, refugee and European law. We note the decision of the Norwegian Immigration Appeals Board to suspend returning refugees and asylum-seekers to Greece under the Dublin II Regulation. We consider the decision to be particularly important in light of the poor conditions in which immigration detainees are held in Greece, and the lack of legal guarantees with regard to examination of their asylum claim. We call on Member States to make use of Article 3.2 of the Dublin II Regulation allowing Member States to examine an asylum application 'even if such examination is not its responsibility under the criteria laid down in this Regulation'. ... We recall that a procedure against Greece was launched by the European Commission at the European Court of Justice for infringing the Dublin II Regulation. It is our understanding that this is because of the lack of legal guarantees with regard to a substantive examination of the asylum claim by Greek authorities after transfer to Greece. We have repeatedly expressed concerns to the Greek authorities about its treatment of asylum-seekers and failure to provide effective asylum procedures. The organisation is concerned to receive reports that asylum-seekers have been held in conditions amounting to arbitrary detention pending the examination of their claim. Asylum-seekers are often interviewed about their claim in the absence of an interpreter and lawyer. Lawyers report that in practice, individuals can expect to have their claim rejected at first instance. We have repeatedly called on the Greek authorities to take concrete measures to improve the conditions for asylum-seekers including by resolving the legal limbo in which they are left – without documents and without access to any social services in practice. In a letter to the Greek authorities sent on 7 February 2008, the organization expressed its concern for the well-being of an estimated 2,500 people, including unaccompanied children as young as nine years old evicted from their makeshift homes in the port area of Patras. Most of the evicted people are believed to be asylum-seekers from Afghanistan. Greece does not return people to Afghanistan and yet does not process their asylum application in a prompt, fair way, leaving them in limbo without legal status and therefore without rights.”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

Mr Antonio Pizzi, a civil servant employed by the Calabria Regional Council, lives in Reggio di Calabria. 8. On 18 May 1982 he applied to the Calabria Regional Administrative Court (“the RAC”) for judicial review of a decision of the Regional Council (Consiglio Regionale) assigning him, at the time when he was recruited to a permanent post, to a staff category lower than the one to which he considered himself to be entitled on the basis of the duties he had performed during the period when he had been employed on a fixed-term contract. 9. On 12 June 1982 the applicant asked for a date to be fixed for the hearing and for his case to be dealt with speedily. 10.

CYPRUS,4,No violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial,Anatoly Kovler;Christos Rozakis;Dean Spielmann;Elisabeth Steiner;Giorgio Malinverni;Sverre Erik Jebens;Takis Eliades,"6. The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Nicosia. He is currently employed on a temporary basis at the Statistical Service of the Republic of Cyprus. 7. On 3 July and 9 August 2000 he made two applications for appointment in different sections of the civil service. On 10 July 2001 and 11 September 2001 both of his applications were refused by the Civil Service Commission on the ground that he had not performed his military service or been legally exempted from it. 8. On 21 September 2001 the applicant lodged a judicial review application before the Supreme Court challenging the relevant decisions of the Civil Service Commission. He contended, inter alia, that he had refused to perform his military service with the Cypriot National Guard as he was a homosexual and that for the determination of his sexual orientation he would have been subjected to degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 and 8 of the Convention. 9. In its interim decision of 24 February 2003 the court rejected an application for amendment of the applicant’s pleadings. It noted that whether or not the applicant was entitled to be exempted from military service was not a contested issue in the pending proceedings and, as such, could not be examined. The issue under dispute in the proceedings before the court was the lawfulness of the decision by the Civil Service Commission dismissing the applicant’s application for lack of fulfilment of the requirement of completion of military service. 10. On 17 October 2003 the Supreme Court rejected the judicial review application and made an order for costs against the applicant. It justified the rejection by referring to the reasons set out in its previous interim decision and, in particular, that the applicant did not meet one of the basic requirements for appointment to the Civil Service. 11. On 28 November 2003, the applicant lodged an appeal before the Supreme Court against its first-instance judgment. The grounds of appeal had been drafted by the applicant’s representative. On 30 July 2004 the applicant filed his skeleton argument which had also been prepared by his representative. The appeal was set for a hearing on 9 October 2006. 12. Until that stage of the proceedings, the applicant was being represented by a lawyer of his choice, but due to his inability to settle outstanding legal fees he had to stop receiving legal assistance from his lawyer. 13. On 2 August 2004 he filed an application for legal aid claiming that the proceedings concerned the protection of his human rights and thus fell within the scope of proceedings for which the grant of legal aid was envisaged by the Legal Aid Law 165 (I) of 2002. 14. On 4 October 2004, his application for legal aid was rejected by the Supreme Court, acting in a panel of five judges, which referred to the relevant provisions of the Legal Aid Law and explained that legal aid could only be provided in criminal proceedings, civil proceedings that concern determination of a litigant’s human rights and proceedings lodged before the family courts. The proceedings introduced by the applicant, who sought judicial review under Article 146 of the Constitution of a decision refusing to appoint him in the civil service, did not constitute civil proceedings and, as such, his legal aid application had to be refused. 15. On 3 November 2006 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. The court referred to the arguments developed by the applicant’s lawyer in the proceedings. It found that the issue of unconstitutionality had not been raised by the applicant’s lawyer in accordance with the requirements set out in the relevant procedural provisions and case-law given that it had only been set out in a vague and imprecise manner in the application seeking judicial review. The court further took into account the points raised by the applicant’s lawyer in his written address to the Court. It found that the vague suggestions made concerning unconstitutionality had no legal foundation and were irrelevant to the subject-matter of the judicial review application. No other ground for annulment of the relevant decision had been raised or shown. 16. Article 146 of the Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus provides as follows: “1. The Supreme Constitutional Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate finally on a recourse made to it on a complaint that a decision, an act or omission of any organ, authority or person, exercising any executive or administrative authority is contrary to any of the provisions of this Constitution or of any law or is made in excess or in abuse of powers vested in such organ or authority or person. 2. Such a recourse may be made by a person whose any existing legitimate interest, which he has either as a person or by virtue of being a member of a Community, is adversely and directly affected by such decision or act or omission. 3. Such a recourse shall be made within seventy-five days of the date when the decision or act was published or, if not published and in the case of an omission, when it came to the knowledge of the person making the recourse. 4. Upon such a recourse the Court may, by its decision- (a) confirm, either in whole or in part, such decision or act or omission; or (b) declare, either in whole or in part, such decision or act to be null and void and of no effect whatsoever, or (c) declare that such omission, either in whole or in part, ought not to have been made and that whatever has been omitted should have been performed. 5. Any decision given under paragraph 4 of this Article shall be binding on all courts and all organs or authorities in the Republic and shall be given effect to and acted upon by the organ or authority or person concerned. 6. Any person aggrieved by any decision or act declared to be void under paragraph 4 of this Article or by any omission declared there under that it ought not to have been made shall be entitled, if his claim is not met to his satisfaction by the organ, authority or person concerned, to institute legal proceedings in a court for the recovery of damages or for being granted other remedy and to recover just and equitable damages to be assessed by the court or to be granted such other just and equitable remedy as such court is empowered to grant.” 17. Law 165 (I) of 2002 on Legal Aid provides, in so far as relevant, as follows: “3. Legal aid shall be granted free of charge in the proceedings provided for in sections 4, 5 and 6 below, to the extent and under the conditions laid down therein. 4.- (1) This section applies- (a) In criminal proceedings before a court, against any person, for an offence that he may have committed in violation of any legislative provision, for which an imprisonment sentence exceeding one year is provided for and includes preliminary interrogation and every other stage of interrogation or other procedure taking place before the commencement of subsequent criminal proceedings that relate to it; (b) Except for the criminal proceedings provided for in paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 5 below, in any other proceedings before a court exercising its criminal jurisdiction. (2) For the purposes of the application of this section, the term “court” means the District Court, Assize Court, Military Court and includes the Supreme Court, when examining any issue raised in criminal proceedings, in exercising its first- or second-instance jurisdiction. (3) In the proceedings provided for in subsection (1) above, legal aid will be granted free of charge, and will include advice, assistance and representation. 5. (1) For the purposes of the application of this section, the term “proceedings for determined violations of human rights” means any: (a) Civil proceedings before a court, at any stage, lodged against the Republic for damages sustained by a person due to determined violations of human rights; or (b) Criminal proceedings lodged by any person where the offence in examination concerns determined violations of human rights. (2) Legal aid will be granted, free of charge, to proceedings concerning determined violations of human rights. (3) Legal aid granted by virtue of this section: (a) In the case of civil proceedings lodged in the Republic or criminal proceedings, will include advice, assistance and representation; and (b) In civil proceedings lodged outside the Republic, will include only advice. (4) The Ministerial Council may, by an order published in the Official Gazette of the Republic, amend the Table. 6. (1) For the purposes of this section, the term “proceedings before a family court” means: (a) Proceedings raised in respect of family relations on the basis of provision of bilateral or multilateral treaties to which the Republic has acceded; or (b) Proceedings concerning parental care, alimony, recognition of a child, adoption, proprietary relations of spouses and any other marital or family dispute. (2) Free legal aid is provided for in proceedings before a family court, and includes advice, assistance and representation.”",[],[],[],['6'],[],[],0

RUSSIA,3,Remainder inadmissible;No violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-1 - Lawful arrest or detention;Article 5-1-f - Extradition);No violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-4 - Review of lawfulness of detention;Take proceedings),Anatoly Kovler;Erik Møse;Julia Laffranque;Khanlar Hajiyev;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska,"5. The applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Saratov. 6. In the 1990s the applicant lived in Uzbekistan and was involved in the activities of Hizb-ut-Tahrir (“HT”), a pan-Islamic organisation banned in Russia. In May 2000 he moved to Russia, leaving behind his wife and two children, born in 1995 and 1997, in Andizhan. 7. On 14 June 2001 the applicant was arrested in Russia on drug-related charges (Article 228-4 of the Russian Criminal Code (“the RCC”)). His Uzbek passport was confiscated upon arrest. On 15 June 2002 the Perovo District Court of Moscow sentenced him to imprisonment. After his release on 27 August 2004, the applicant arrived in Saratov, where he started a relationship with a Belarusian national. It appears that she was residing in Russia unlawfully at the material time. They have two minor children born in 2006 and 2008. 8. On 29 March 2006 the Andizhan Office of the National Security Service of Uzbekistan charged the applicant, in absentia, with attempting to overthrow the existing regime under Article 159-3 (a and b) of the Uzbek Criminal Code (“the UCC”). 9. On the same day the Andizhan regional prosecutor ordered the applicant’s placement in custody and put his name on a search list. 10. On 4 June 2007 the applicant was additionally charged with setting up a criminal group (Article 242-1 of the UCC), producing and disseminating documents containing a threat to national security and public order (Article 244(1)-3 (a and c) of the UCC), and setting up, managing and participating in extremist, separatist, fundamentalist and other banned organisations (Article 244(2)-1 of the UCC). 11. On an unspecified date his name was put on the international wanted list. 12. On 26 February 2010 the applicant was arrested by the police in Saratov as a person wanted by the Uzbek authorities. On 8 March 2010 the Uzbek Prosecutor General’s Office submitted a formal request asking its Russian counterpart to extradite the applicant on criminal charges under Articles 159-3 (a and b), 242-1, 244(1)-3 (a and c) and 244(2)-1 of the UCC. Relying on Article 66 of the Convention on Legal Assistance and Legal Relations in Civil, Family and Criminal Matters (“the Minsk Convention”), the Uzbek authorities provided assurances that the applicant would not be extradited to a third country without the consent of the Russian Federation, that he would not be prosecuted, tried or punished for an offence which was not the subject of the extradition request and that he would be able to freely leave Uzbekistan, once the court proceedings had terminated and the sentence served. On 11 March 2010 the Russian Prosecutor General’s Office received the extradition request. 13. Thereafter, the Russian Prosecutor General’s Office carried out a preliminary check of the extradition request (“an extradition check”) (see paragraph 65 below). It can be seen from the information collected between March and June 2010 by the Federal Migration Service (“the FMS”), the Federal Security Service (“the FSB”) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that the applicant was an Uzbek national who had not applied for Russian citizenship or temporary asylum or registered his residence in Russia. The said authorities saw no obstacle to his extradition to Uzbekistan. Moreover, on 22 June 2010 the FSB submitted that the applicant was “certainly a functionary” of HT and recommended that he be extradited. 14. On 9 August 2010 the deputy Prosecutor General granted the extradition request and issued an extradition order in respect of the applicant. He referred to the charges brought against the applicant, according to which he had been a founding manager and financial supporter of HT, had created a number of sub-groups of the said organisation in Uzbekistan and actively participated in the dissemination of its subversive materials, characterised as extremist, separatist and fundamentalist. The prosecutor decided to extradite the applicant on charges of setting up a criminal group and participating therein (Article 210-1 and 2 of the RCC) and attempting to overthrow the existing regime and constitutional order (Article 278 of the RCC). He noted that the statute of limitations for those offences had not expired either in Russia or in Uzbekistan. The prosecutor further pointed out that, in line with the Minsk Convention and the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure (“the CCrP”), differences in the legal classification of the offences and their elements under Russian and Uzbek criminal law were not sufficient grounds for refusing extradition. Lastly, the prosecutor referred to the information provided by the FMS that the applicant was an Uzbek national who had not applied for Russian citizenship. The prosecutor concluded that there were no obstacles to his extradition to Uzbekistan. 15. On 18 August 2010 the extradition order was served on the applicant. 16. On 19 August 2010 the applicant sought judicial review of the extradition order, referring, inter alia, to a fear of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, in particular, on account of his connections with HT. The applicant’s appeal was supported with his lawyer’s claims of 23 August and 16 September 2010 that torture remained a widespread practice in Uzbekistan, according to reports of numerous international organisations and recent media publications. 17. On 16 September 2010 the Saratov Regional Court upheld the extradition order, relying on the assurances issued by the Uzbek Prosecutor General’s Office that the applicant would be treated in strict compliance with internal procedural norms. It also referred to the dismissal of the applicant’s request for refugee status by the FMS on 14 September 2010 (see paragraph 37 below). 18. On 21 and 23 September 2010 the applicant and his lawyer appealed. On 17 November 2010 the Supreme Court of Russia set aside the judgment of 16 September 2010 and ordered a new judicial review by the first-instance court. 19. On 28 December 2010 the Regional Court re-examined the case and annulled the extradition order of 9 August 2010, mainly because of inconsistencies and mistakes made in the comparative assessment of the relevant criminal offences under Uzbek and Russian law. In addition, the court made the following findings: “... The allegation of a risk of ill-treatment should be dismissed because the case file contains written assurances made by the deputy Prosecutor General of Uzbekistan who affirmed that prosecution of the applicant would be in strict conformity with the Uzbek Code of Criminal Procedure ... The court has no reason to distrust these guarantees ... Article 464 of the Russian CCrP prohibits the extradition of a person who has been granted asylum in Russia on account of persecution in the requesting State because of his race, religion, citizenship, ethnic or social origin or political beliefs. Prior to the date of the extradition order, [the applicant] had applied for refugee status and had subsequently sought judicial review of the refusal of such status in Russia. Such review proceedings have not been completed. Taking into account paragraph 1 and 4 of section 10 of the Refugees Act, a person cannot be extradited before a court decision has been taken on judicial review of a refusal of refugee status. Thus, the extradition order was premature, in breach of the Refugees Act ...” The applicant was released in the courtroom. 20. The regional prosecutor’s office appealed. On 4 March 2011 the Supreme Court upheld the judgment of 28 December 2010. 21. In view of the above findings, the extradition case against the applicant was not pursued and his removal from Russia to Uzbekistan on that account became impossible. 22. From 26 February to 28 December 2010 the applicant was detained with a view to extradition. 23. On 26 February 2010 the applicant was arrested by the police in Saratov as a person wanted by the Uzbek authorities. He was placed in remand centre no. 64/1. According to the Government, the applicant made no allegation of a risk of ill-treatment in the event of his extradition to Uzbekistan. 24. On the same day, referring to Article 466 of the CCrP the deputy district prosecutor lodged an application asking the Kirovskiy District Court of Saratov to authorise the applicant’s detention. Relying on Article 108 of the CCrP, the district court granted this request and ordered the applicant’s detention until 6 April 2010 with a view to his extradition to Uzbekistan. The court observed that the applicant had been charged with offences punishable under Articles 278, 210-1, 280-1, 282(1)-1 and 282(2)-1 of the RCC; that the statute of limitations for the said offences had not expired either in Russia or in Uzbekistan; that the applicant, an Uzbek national, had not registered his residence in Russia and had absconded there; and that, given the state of the applicant’s health, he was fit for detention. The applicant and his lawyer did not appeal against the detention order of 26 February 2010. It became final on 1 March 2010. 25. After receipt of the Uzbek extradition request and before the expiry of the time-limit set in the detention order of 26 February 2010, the deputy district prosecutor lodged an application asking the district court to extend the applicant’s detention. On 1 April 2010 the district court extended the applicant’s detention until 25 August 2010. The court dismissed the applicant’s argument that his detention would put his underage children in a difficult financial situation and that he had lodged an application for refugee status. The court concluded as follows: “Under Article 110 of the CCrP a preventive measure may be varied if it is no longer necessary or if the grounds justifying it (see Articles 97 and 99 of the Code) have changed. The available material does not disclose that any such grounds have changed in the present case ...” 26. The applicant and his lawyer appealed on 2 and 5 April 2010. On 14 April 2010 the Saratov Regional Court dismissed the appeals. 27. On 23 August 2010 the district court examined a new extension request from the prosecutor and extended the applicant’s detention until 25 November 2010. The court held as follows: “[The applicant] sought judicial review of the extradition decision against him ... Articles 109 and 110 of the CCrP provide that a preventive measure may be varied if it is no longer necessary or if the grounds justifying it (see Articles 97 and 99 of the Code) have changed. Extension of detention beyond six months may be allowed only in respect of persons charged with serious and particularly serious criminal offences and only on account of the exceptional complexity of the case ... The available material discloses that the extradition order could not be enforced, where the previous detention order was in force, because the applicant had applied for judicial review of the extradition order. These are objective circumstances disclosing the particular complexity of the case. Thus, the extension term mentioned in the request is reasonable ...” 28. On 24 and 26 August 2010 the applicant and his lawyer appealed, seeking house arrest instead of detention in a remand centre. On 31 August 2010 the Regional Court upheld the detention order of 23 August 2010. 29. On 17 November 2010 the Supreme Court ordered the applicant’s detention until 17 December 2010, pending the re-examination of the extradition case by the Regional Court. 30. On 22 November 2010 the District Court examined an extension request by the district prosecutor and issued a new detention order extending the applicant’s detention to 25 February 2011 pending judicial review of the extradition order. The court noted that Article 109 of the CCrP allowed the extension of detention up to twelve months in relation to serious and particularly serious charges and on account of the particular complexity of the case. The court was satisfied that the above conditions had been complied with in respect of the applicant. On 2 December 2010 the Regional Court upheld the detention order of 22 November 2010. 31. On 28 December 2010 the applicant was released from detention. 32. On 17 or 24 March 2010 the applicant lodged a request for refugee status with the FMS Office of the Saratov Region (“the regional FMS”). 33. On 29 March 2010 he submitted an additional request, whereby he expressed a fear of being subjected to persecution and torture owing to his previous membership of Hizb-ut-Tahrir. He referred to a number of international reports in support of his allegations. 34. On 6 April 2010, in an interview with a regional FMS officer conducted in the presence of his lawyer, the applicant submitted that he had left Uzbekistan for work-related reasons. 35. On 1 July 2010 the regional FMS rejected the applicant’s request for refugee status. The authority noted that the applicant had left Uzbekistan in 2000 for economic reasons whereas criminal proceedings against him had not been brought until 2006 in his country of origin. He had been prosecuted for having set up a criminal group, which was not a political crime under the UCC. Furthermore, the applicant had not lodged his application for refugee status until 2010. The FMS established that he faced no risk of persecution on account of his origin, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group. It concluded that the applicant did not wish to return to Uzbekistan so as to avoid prosecution for the crime with which he had been charged. 36. On 5 July 2010 the applicant was informed of the above-mentioned decision and lodged a hierarchical appeal on 28 July 2010. 37. On 14 September 2010 the FMS Central Office dismissed his appeal. The FMS referred to the decision of the Russian Supreme Court of 14 February 2003 to declare HT a terrorist organisation and ban its activity in Russia. The FMS emphasised the applicant’s involvement in HT in 1999-2000 as a manager and financial supporter. It pointed out that in 2006 at the latest the applicant had learnt from his brother that the Uzbekistan authorities had begun prosecuting HT members. However, it was not until 2010 that the applicant had submitted his request for refugee status. Hence, the FMS concluded that the applicant’s fear of persecution was unsubstantiated. 38. On 16 October 2010 the applicant appealed against the refusal to grant him refugee status to the Basmannyy District Court of Moscow. He reiterated his fear of being subjected to torture in the event of extradition to Uzbekistan and stated that the risk of ill-treatment had not been assessed by the FMS. 39. On 24 December 2010 the District Court upheld the decision of 14 September 2010 on judicial review. Noting that the applicant had confirmed his involvement in HT’s activities between 1997 and 2000, the court also observed that after his arrest in February 2010 the applicant had made no official statement to Uzbek or Russian authorities distancing himself from HT teachings or his previous participation in its activities. The court held as follows: “After his arrival in Russia the applicant did not apply for refugee status. He first alleged a risk of persecution in Uzbekistan and raised his wish to remain in Russia as a refugee after having been arrested following the request from the Uzbek authorities. Neither following his arrival in Russia in 2000 nor during criminal proceedings in 2002 did he distance himself from HT teachings or state his refusal to participate in its activities. He did not apply for refugee status when he learnt in 2005-2006 from his younger brother that his fellow HT supporters were being looked for and tortured by the Uzbek authorities ... Had the applicant’s fears of persecution in Uzbekistan been truly justified, he would have immediately sought asylum in the country of his destination. The UN Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status indicates that persecution must be distinguished from punishment for a common law offence. Persons fleeing from prosecution or punishment for such an offence are not normally refugees. It should be borne in mind that a refugee is a victim – or potential victim – of injustice, not a fugitive from justice (paragraph 56) ... The applicant has not adduced convincing arguments concerning religious or political persecution ...” 40. On 28 December 2010 the applicant applied for temporary asylum. It was refused on 25 March 2011. 41. On 18 May 2011 the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment of 24 December 2010, refusing the applicant refugee status. Endorsing the reasoning of the first-instance court, the appeal court added the following: “The Uzbek Ministry of Foreign Affairs affirms its attachment to their obligations in relation to protecting human rights. The Uzbek legislation provides that every citizen has freedom of religion. Article 18 of the Uzbek Constitution protects equality of citizens before the law irrespective of gender, race, national language, religion, faith or social origin ... The court dismisses as unconvincing the arguments relating to the individualised status of the applicant on account of criminal prosecution in Uzbekistan. Neither during his residence in Belarus nor immediately after his arrival in Russia did the applicant seek asylum. He first expressed his fears of persecution in Uzbekistan after his arrest because his name had been added to the international wanted list ... Taking into account the UN Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status (paragraph 66), in order to be considered a refugee, a person must show well-founded fear of persecution. Discrimination may turn into persecution when it becomes impossible to carry out work in specific areas, to receive education or if other freedoms protected in democratic societies are limited ... The applicant has not substantiated any facts concerning unlawful persecution ...” 42. By a letter of 5 July 2011, the Moscow Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Representation informed the applicant’s lawyer that the UNHCR had determined that the applicant met the criteria set out in its Statute in connection with Article 1 A of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. It had been ascertained that the applicant was outside his country of nationality owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted by the authorities of his country for reasons of his religion and imputed political opinion and, owing to such fear, was unable to return to Uzbekistan, where he might be exposed to torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Therefore, the UNHCR considered that the applicant was eligible for international protection under its mandate. 43. Everyone has a right to liberty and security (Article 22 § 1). Detention is permissible only on the basis of a court order. The length of time for which a person may be detained prior to obtaining such an order must not exceed forty-eight hours (Article 22 § 2). 44. The term “court” is defined by the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure (“the CCrP”) of 2002 as “any court of general jurisdiction which examines a criminal case on the merits and delivers decisions provided for by this Code” (Article 5 § 48). The term “judge” is defined by the CCrP as “an official empowered to administer justice” (Article 5 § 54). 45. A district court has the power to examine all criminal cases except for those falling within the respective jurisdictions of a justice of the peace, a regional court or the Supreme Court of Russia (Article 31 § 2). 46. Chapter 13 of the CCrP governs the application of preventive measures. Detention is a preventive measure applied on the basis of a court decision to a person suspected of or charged with a criminal offence punishable by at least two years’ imprisonment where it is impossible to apply a more lenient preventive measure (Article 108 § 1). A court request for detention is submitted by an investigator (следователь) with the support of the head of the investigative authority or by a police officer in charge of the inquiry (дознаватель) with the support of a prosecutor (Article 108 § 3). A request for detention should be examined by a judge of a district court or a military court of a corresponding level in the presence of the person concerned (Article 108 § 4). Second-instance courts should examine appeals lodged against judge’s decisions on detention within three days (Article 108 § 11). The period of detention pending investigation of a criminal case must not exceed two months (Article 109 § 1) but may be extended up to six months by a judge of a district court or a military court of a corresponding level. Further extensions up to twelve months may be granted with regard to persons accused of serious or particularly serious criminal offences (Article 109 § 2). Extensions up to eighteen months may be granted as an exception with regard to persons accused of particular serious criminal offences (Article 109 § 3). 47. A measure of restraint can be applied with a view to ensuring a person’s extradition in compliance with the procedure established under Article 466 of the CCrP (Article 97 § 2). 48. Chapter 54 of the CCrP (Articles 460-468) governs the procedure to be followed in the event of extradition. 49. A court is to review the lawfulness and validity of a decision to extradite within a month of receipt of a request for review. The decision should be taken in open court by a panel of three judges in the presence of a prosecutor, the person whose extradition is sought and the latter’s legal counsel (Article 463 § 4). 50. Article 464 § 1 lists the conditions under which extradition cannot be authorised. Thus, the extradition of the following should be denied: a Russian citizen (Article 464 § 1-1) or a person who was granted asylum in Russia (Article 464 § 1-2); a person in respect of whom a conviction became effective or criminal proceedings were terminated in Russia in connection with the same act for which he or she has been prosecuted in the requesting State (Article 464 § 1-3); a person in respect of whom criminal proceedings cannot be launched and a conviction cannot become effective in view of the expiry of the statute of limitations or under another valid ground under Russian law (Article 464 § 1-4); or a person in respect of whom a Russian court established obstacles to extradition, in accordance with the legislation and international treaties of the Russian Federation (Article 464 § 1-5). Finally, extradition should be denied if the act that gave grounds for the extradition request does not constitute a criminal offence under the RCC (Article 464 § 1-6). 51. In the event that a foreign national, whose extradition is being sought, is being prosecuted or is serving a penalty for another criminal offence in Russia, his extradition may be postponed until the prosecution is terminated, the penalty is lifted on any valid ground or the sentence is served (Article 465 § 1). 52. Upon receipt of a request for extradition not accompanied by an arrest warrant issued by a foreign court, the Prosecutor General or his deputy is to “take measures” in order to decide on the preventive measure in respect of the person whose extradition is being sought. The preventive measure is to be applied in accordance with the established procedure (Article 466 § 1). 53. Upon receipt of a request for extradition accompanied by an arrest warrant issued by a foreign judicial body, a prosecutor may place the person whose extradition is being sought under house arrest or in custodial detention without prior approval of his or her decision by a court of the Russian Federation (Article 466 § 2). 54. Verifying the compatibility of section 31(2) of the Law on the Legal Status of Foreign Nationals in the USSR of 1981, the Constitutional Court ruled that a foreign national liable to be expelled from Russian territory could not be detained for more than forty-eight hours without a court order. 55. Assessing the compatibility of Article 466 § 1 of the CCrP with the Russian Constitution, the Constitutional Court reiterated its settled case-law to the effect that excessive or arbitrary detention, unlimited in time and without appropriate review, was incompatible with Article 22 of the Constitution and Article 14 § 3 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in all cases, including extradition proceedings. 56. In the Constitutional Court’s view, the absence of specific regulation of detention matters in Article 466 § 1 did not create a legal lacuna incompatible with the Constitution. Article 8 § 1 of the 1993 Minsk Convention provided that, in executing a request for legal assistance, the requested party would apply its domestic law, that is the procedure laid down in the CCrP. That procedure comprised, in particular, Article 466 § 1 of the Code and the norms in its Chapter 13 (“Preventive measures”), which, by virtue of their general character and position in Part I of the Code (“General provisions”), applied to all stages and forms of criminal proceedings, including proceedings for the examination of extradition requests. 57. The Constitutional Court emphasised that the guarantees of the right to liberty and personal integrity set out in Article 22 and Chapter 2 of the Constitution were fully applicable to detention with a view to extradition. Accordingly, Article 466 of the CCrP did not allow the authorities to apply a custodial measure without complying with the procedure established in the CCrP or in excess of the time-limits fixed in the Code. 58. The Prosecutor General asked the Constitutional Court for official clarification of its decision no. 101-O of 4 April 2006 (see above), for the purpose, in particular, of elucidating the procedure for extending a person’s detention with a view to extradition. 59. The Constitutional Court refused the request on the ground that it was not competent to indicate specific provisions of the criminal law governing the procedure and time-limits for holding a person in custody with a view to extradition. That matter was within the competence of the courts of general jurisdiction. 60. The Constitutional Court reiterated its settled case-law to the effect that the scope of the constitutional right to liberty and personal inviolability was the same for foreign nationals and stateless persons as for Russian nationals. A foreign national or stateless person may not be detained in Russia for more than forty-eight hours without a judicial decision. That constitutional requirement served as a guarantee against excessively long detention beyond forty-eight hours, and also against arbitrary detention as such, in that it required a court to examine whether the arrest was lawful and justified. 61. The Constitutional Court held that Article 466 § 1 of the CCrP, read in conjunction with the Minsk Convention, could not be construed as permitting the detention of an individual for more than forty-eight hours on the basis of a request for his or her extradition without a decision by a Russian court. A custodial measure could be applied only in accordance with the procedure established in the CCrP and within the time-limits fixed in the Code. 62. The Constitutional Court dismissed as inadmissible a request for a review of the constitutionality of Article 466 § 2 of the CCrP, stating that this provision “does not establish time-limits for custodial detention and does not establish the reasons and procedure for choosing a preventive measure, it merely confirms a prosecutor’s power to execute a decision already delivered by a competent judicial body of a foreign state to detain an accused. Therefore the disputed norm cannot be considered to violate constitutional rights of [the claimant] ...” 63. In Ruling no. 22, adopted by the Plenary Session of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation on 29 October 2009 (“the Ruling of 29 October 2009”), it was stated that, pursuant to Article 466 § 1 of the CCrP, only a court could order the placement in custody of a person in respect of whom an extradition check was pending and where the authorities of the country requesting extradition had not submitted a court decision remanding him or her in custody. The judicial authorisation of placement in custody in that situation was to be carried out in accordance with Article 108 of the CCrP and following a prosecutor’s request for that person to be placed in custody (paragraph 34 of the Ruling). In deciding to remand a person in custody a court was to examine if there were factual and legal grounds for the application of that preventive measure. If the extradition request was accompanied by a detention order of a foreign court, a prosecutor was entitled to remand the person in custody without a Russian court’s authorisation (Article 466 § 2 of the CCrP) for a period not exceeding two months, and the prosecutor’s decision could be challenged in the courts under Article 125 of the CCrP. 64. In extending a person’s detention with a view to extradition a court was to apply Article 109 of the CCrP. 65. On 18 October 2008 the Russian Prosecutor General’s Office issued Direction no. 212/35 concerning the “extradition check” procedure for dealing with requests for extradition. According to the Direction, district and town prosecutors should interview a person who has been detained with a view to extradition, submit the interview record to the Prosecutor General’s Office within twenty-four hours and take measures to ensure this person’s placement in custody for forty-eight hours. Having received confirmation from the requesting State of their intention to seek extradition, these officials should take measures for authorising the person’s detention, in compliance with Russia’s international treaties and the applicable national legislation. These public officials should also interview the detainee in order to ascertain the purpose of his arrival in Russia, his residence, nationality and intention to seek asylum in Russia; to verify the authenticity of the documents relating to his identity and nationality; and to verify the existence and veracity of information relating to the possible refusal or postponement of extradition. The information and documents collected during the extradition check should be submitted, within three days of the person’s arrest, to the regional prosecutor. 66. The Russian Federation is a party to the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, adopted on 28 July 1951 by the United Nations Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Status of Refugees and Stateless Persons convened under General Assembly resolution 429 (V) of 14 December 1950. Article 33 of this Convention reads as follows: “1. No Contracting State shall expel or return (“refouler”) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. 2. The benefit of the present provision may not, however, be claimed by a refugee whom there are reasonable grounds for regarding as a danger to the security of the country in which he is, or who, having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community of that country.” 67. In 2007 the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees issued an Advisory Opinion on the Extraterritorial Application of Non-Refoulement Obligations under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol; it provides the following clarification [internal footnotes are omitted]: “7. The prohibition of refoulement to a danger of persecution under international refugee law is applicable to any form of forcible removal, including deportation, expulsion, extradition, informal transfer or “renditions”, and non-admission at the border in the circumstances described below. This is evident from the wording of Article 33(1) of the 1951 Convention, which refers to expulsion or return (refoulement) “in any manner whatsoever”. It applies not only in respect of return to the country of origin or, in the case of a stateless person, the country of former habitual residence, but also to any other place where a person has reason to fear threats to his or her life or freedom related to one or more of the grounds set out in the 1951 Convention, or from where he or she risks being sent to such a risk. 8. The principle of non-refoulement as provided for in Article 33(1) of the 1951 Convention does not, as such, entail a right of the individual to be granted asylum in a particular State. It does mean, however, that where States are not prepared to grant asylum to persons who are seeking international protection on their territory, they must adopt a course that does not result in their removal, directly or indirectly, to a place where their lives or freedom would be in danger on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. As a general rule, in order to give effect to their obligations under the 1951 Convention and/or 1967 Protocol, States will be required to grant individuals seeking international protection access to the territory and to fair and efficient asylum procedures.”",[],[],[],['5'],"['5-1', '5-4']",['5-1-f'],0
41,001-101905,ENG,GEO,ADMISSIBILITY,2010,SHAVISHVILI v. GEORGIA,4,Inadmissible,Françoise Tulkens;Guido Raimondi;Ireneu Cabral Barreto;Kristina Pardalos;Nona Tsotsoria,"The applicant, Mrs Rusudan Shavishvili, is a Georgian national who was born in 1963 and lives in Tbilisi. The respondent Government were represented by their Agent, Mr Levan Meskhoradze of the Ministry of Justice. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. In January 1994 the applicant and Mr Sh. started living together as husband and wife without formally registering their marriage. On 3 July 1995 a child was born to them. On 30 May 1997 an incident of physical harassment of the applicant by Mr Sh. took place. On 8 July 1997, as soon as the applicant had reported about that incident, the Kaspi Regional Prosecutor opened a criminal case against Mr Sh. for battery of the applicant. On 3 December 1998 the applicant brought an action requesting child support from Mr Sh., with whom she had terminated cohabitation by that time. In a decision of 1 March 1999, the Gldani-Nadzaladevi District Court in Tbilisi allowed the applicant’s action. Mr Sh. was ordered to assist her in the raising of their daughter by paying 25% of his income monthly, which amount however should never be less than 50 Georgian laris (GEL, 23 euros (EUR)). The payments were to take effect from 3 December 1998, the date of the introduction of the applicant’s action, until their child reached the age of majority (18 years). No subsequent appeal was lodged against that decision, and it became binding. On 25 June 1999 the Enforcement Department of the Ministry of Justice reproached the competent bailiff of the Kaspi District for not having enforced the decision of 1 March 1999. The bailiff was instructed to recover GEL 350 (EUR 159) from the debtor in a lump sum as arrears for the past seven months of non-payment, and to ensure the continuous payment of the maintenance in future. The Enforcement Department further ordered that the debtor’s whereabouts be established and his assets frozen, to be sold by compulsory public auction, if necessary. In July-August 1999 the bailiff itemised and froze Mr Sh.’s real and movable property. Some assets of minor value were later sold at public auction, as a result of which enforcement measure the applicant received GEL 90 (EUR 41). On 21 August 2000 the Enforcement Department informed the applicant that Mr Sh. had managed to alienate some of the frozen assets, in respect of which fact the General Prosecutor’s Office later opened another criminal case. On 11 December 2003 the Tbilisi Regional Court, overturning a lower instance verdict, found Mr Sh. guilty of infliction of less serious bodily injury to the applicant and the persistent non-payment of the court-awarded maintenance, offences under Articles 118 § 1 and 176 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to one year and six months’ conditional imprisonment for the first offence and fined GEL 200 (EUR 91) for the second. In addition, the Regional Court examined the applicant’s civil claims. Thus, in the same judgment of 11 December 2003, it ordered Mr Sh. to pay her GEL 2,910 (EUR 1,323) in pecuniary damages, this amount corresponding to the arrears of maintenance for the past sixty months, and GEL 2,000 (EUR 909) in non-pecuniary damages for the distress caused by his wrongful actions. In a decision of 4 March 2004, delivered in the applicant’s presence, the Supreme Court upheld the judgment of 11 December 2003. On 23 April and December 2004 the Tbilisi Regional Court issued enforcement writs on the basis of the judgment of 11 December 2003, ordering Mr Sh. to pay the applicant GEL 4,910 (EUR 2,232) within six months. Supervision of the enforcement was entrusted to the Ministry of Justice. On 17 August 2004 the Ministry of Justice, complaining to the Kaspi District Court that Mr Sh. had failed to discharge the judgment debt of 11 December 2003, requested that the probation be cancelled and that he be imprisoned. On 21 October 2004 the District Court dismissed that request. The relevant legal provisions concerning the possibility of suing the enforcement authority were cited in the case of Nazaretian v. Georgia ((dec.), no. 13909/06, 7 July 2009).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
42,001-23610,ENG,PRT,ADMISSIBILITY,2003,PAULINO TOMAS v. PORTUGAL,1,Inadmissible,,"The applicant, Ms Ana Maria Paulino Tomás, is a Portuguese national who was born in 1970 and lives in Caldas da Rainha (Portugal). She was represented before the Court by Ms A.P. de Carvalho, of the Caldas da Rainha Bar, who appeared on her behalf at the hearing on 27 March 2003. The respondent Government were represented at the hearing by their Agent, Mr J. Miguel, Deputy Attorney-General, assisted by Ms M.M. Flores Ferreira, Deputy Attorney-General and coordinator of the Administrative Proceedings Division of the Central Administrative Court. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 17 May 1993 the applicant brought an action for damages against two private individuals and the Motor Insurance Fund (“the Fund”) in the Caldas da Rainha District Court after suffering a road accident. She also applied for legal aid. On 25 May 1993 the court summoned the defendants to appear. The Fund filed pleadings in reply on 13 July 1993. One of the other defendants filed his pleadings on 14 July 1993 and also applied for legal aid. In an order of 10 February 1995 the court requested information from the police authorities about the financial and social circumstances of the applicant and the defendant who had applied for legal aid. The National Republican Guard replied on 26 May 1995. On 26 June 1995 the court gave a preliminary decision (despacho saneador) setting out the facts that had already been established and the matters remaining to be clarified. It also awarded legal aid to the applicant and the defendant who had applied for it. After the registry of the Caldas da Rainha District Court had realised that the applicant had not been notified either of the defendants’ pleadings in reply or of the preliminary decision, the court directed on 15 February 1996 that those documents should be served on her. On 30 September 1996 the applicant submitted a list of the witnesses she wished to have examined. She also asked the court to order an insurance company and the Caldas da Rainha medical centre to produce certain documents and requested an expert medical opinion. The court allowed her requests on 28 October 1996. The Caldas da Rainha medical centre produced the requisite documents on 30 January 1997. The insurance company did so on 2 December 1997, after the court had fined it for failing to comply with its order in good time. In an order of 30 January 1998 the court announced that the appointment of the experts would take place on 9 February 1998. The experts carried out the examination on 20 May 1998 and submitted their report on 2 June 1998. On 30 June 1998 the court set the case down for hearing on 25 November 1998. However, the hearing could not take place on that date because counsel for one of the defendants was absent. It was postponed until 26 April 1999 but could not take place on that date either, as the District Court was occupied with the taking of evidence from witnesses in a criminal case. The hearing finally took place on 16 November 1999. In a judgment of 4 January 2000 the District Court allowed the applicant’s claims in part. Article 20 § 4 of the 1976 Constitution enshrines the right to a “judicial decision within a reasonable time”. Article 22 also defines the civil liability of the State and its authorities and agents in the following terms: “The State and other public bodies shall be jointly and severally liable in civil law with the members of their agencies, their officials or their agents for actions or omissions in the performance of their duties, or caused by such performance, which result in violations of rights, freedoms or safeguards or in prejudice to another party.” Legislative Decree no. 48051 governs the State’s non-contractual civil liability. It contains the following provisions of relevance to the instant case: Article 2 § 1 “The State and other public bodies shall be liable to third parties in civil law for such breaches of their rights or of legal provisions designed to protect the interests of such parties as are caused by unlawful acts committed with negligence (culpa) by their agencies or officials in the performance of their duties or as a consequence thereof.” Article 6 “For the purposes of this Decree, legal transactions which infringe statutory provisions and regulations or generally applicable general principles, and physical acts which infringe such provisions and principles or the technical rules and rules of general prudence that must be observed, shall be deemed unlawful.” Article 7 “The obligation on the State and other public bodies and on members of their agencies and their officials to pay compensation shall not be contingent on the victims’ use of their right of appeal against the measures that gave rise to the damage; however, the right to compensation shall be available only if the damage is not attributable to the failure to lodge an appeal or to negligence in the conduct of proceedings after an appeal has been lodged.” In accordance with the case-law concerning the State’s non-contractual liability, the State is required to pay compensation only if an unlawful act has been committed with negligence and there is a causal link between the act and the alleged damage. Article 498 of the Civil Code provides that the right to compensation is time-barred after the expiry of a period of three years from the date on which the victim becomes, or should have become, aware of the possibility of exercising that right. The Supreme Administrative Court’s decision of 7 March 1989 in the case of Garagens Pintosinho, Lda was for a long time the only example of the application of Legislative Decree no. 48051 to the length of proceedings. Referring to the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in the cases of Guincho v. Portugal (10 July 1984, Series A no. 81), Baraona v. Portugal (8 July 1987, Series A no. 122) and Martins Moreira v. Portugal (26 October 1988, Series A no. 143), the Supreme Administrative Court considered that the excessive length of proceedings was to be regarded as an unlawful act meriting compensation. The main period in issue in the Garagens Pintosinho, Lda case was the five years it took for the Lisbon industrial tribunal to deliver a judgment that should have been given within a statutory period of three days. Subsequently, on 15 October 1998, the Supreme Administrative Court gave a ruling in the case of Pires Neno, concerning civil proceedings that had lasted almost seven years for one level of jurisdiction. The appellants in that case had also lodged an application with the European Commission of Human Rights complaining of the length of those proceedings. Their application had resulted in the adoption by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe of a resolution awarding them 540,000 Portuguese escudos (PTE) by way of just satisfaction. The Supreme Administrative Court allowed their claims in part and ordered the State to pay them PTE 900,000 in compensation, less the above-mentioned sum of PTE 540,000. Referring to the Strasbourg Court’s case-law, it considered, in particular, that the State incurred non-contractual civil liability for the non-pecuniary and pecuniary damage resulting from the unlawful and negligent administration of justice in breach of Article 20 of the Constitution and Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The judgment was published and commented on in the legal journal Cadernos de Justiça Administrativa (no. 17, September/October 1999). The Supreme Administrative Court gave a similar decision on 1 February 2001 in the case of Alecarpeças, Lda, concerning the delay with which a court’s instructions had been carried out in enforcement proceedings. The court pointed out that failure to comply with procedural deadlines was not in itself an unlawful act but that it became unlawful if Article 6 § 1 of the Convention was breached at the same time. Lastly, the Coimbra Administrative Court, in a judgment of 14 July 1999 that was not contested by the State, likewise allowed a claim for damages on the basis of the State’s non-contractual liability for the excessive length of proceedings concerning an objection to an enforcement measure that had already been carried out. According to a statistical table produced by the Government, twenty-five actions to establish non-contractual liability on the part of the State for the excessive length of proceedings had been brought before the administrative courts. In four of them the courts had found against the State, and in four others the applicants’ claims had been dismissed. The proceedings are still pending in seventeen cases; in two of them, the first-instance court has found against the State, which has subsequently appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court. In July 2001 the Government tabled Bill no. 95/VIII in Parliament, concerning the State’s non-contractual civil liability and repealing Legislative Decree no. 48051. The explanatory memorandum on the bill stated, inter alia, that “for the first time in Portuguese law”, there was a statute dealing comprehensively with the State’s non-contractual liability for damage resulting from the performance of political, legislative, administrative and, “for the first time in Portugal”, judicial duties. It pointed out that it had been “thought helpful to incorporate into law various conclusions reached by the courts over the course of time”. Clauses 7 to 10 of the bill governed the State’s liability for damage caused in the performance of its administrative duties. Clause 7 (2) and (3) explicitly introduced the concept of “administrative fault” or “official error”. Clause 12 of the bill provided, inter alia: “... the rules on liability for unlawful acts committed in the performance of administrative duties shall apply to damage caused by the unlawful administration of justice, particularly in the case of a violation of the right to a judicial decision within a reasonable time.” The bill lapsed as a result of the dissolution of Parliament. On 21 November 2002, however, the new Parliament passed on its first reading Bill no. 148/IX, tabled by members of the Socialist Party, which reproduced in full the explanatory memorandum to and the text of Bill no. 95/VIII. The bill still has to be approved on its second reading. On 20 December 2002 the Attorney-General issued a circular to all officials and members of his department. He instructed them not to challenge the administrative courts’ jurisdiction ratione materiae to deal with actions to establish non-contractual liability on the part of the State for the excessive length of proceedings. By Article 76 of the Regulations on the Attorney-General’s Department, all officials and members of the department are required to abide by the circular.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
43,001-71885,ENG,DNK,ADMISSIBILITY,2005,NORDISK FILM & TV A/S v. DENMARK,1,Inadmissible,Christos Rozakis,"The applicant, Nordisk Film & TV A/S, is a private limited company, which is domiciled in Valby, Denmark. It is represented before the Court by Mr Tyge Trier, a lawyer practising in Copenhagen. The applicant company is a television producer. In October 1999 its documentary unit called “Fak2eren” decided to produce a programme investigating paedophilia in Denmark which was to be broadcast on national television. In this connection the journalists employed by the applicant company unsuccessfully sought permission from an association named “The Paedophile Association” to attend its meetings or conduct interviews with its members. The said association was formed “to work toward the development of paedophiles’ sense of responsibility towards children” and it holds regular meetings, but they are generally closed to the public and the media. Its members include convicted sexual offenders. The association was not illegal under Danish law, a fact which had been the subject of public debate. Wishing to probe into the Paedophile Association’s activities, a journalist, JB, using the pseudonym “Jacob Andersen”, went undercover, posing as a member. In the course of his year long membership “Jacob Andersen” participated in quasi-public meetings, was invited to so-called “private meetings” and was befriended by two other members “Mogens” and “Per”. These two made many incriminating statements regarding the realities of paedophilia in both Denmark and India, including advice on how to induce a child to chat over the internet, comments about how difficult it was to procure sexual acts from children in Denmark, and how easy on the other hand it was to procure children in Eastern Europe and India. “Mogens” recommended to “Jacob Andersen” a specific hotel, run by a Danish paedophile in India, at which “Mogens” had had sex with Indian boys in the past. JB visited the hotel in India and interviewed an Indian boy about his knowledge of “Mogens”. Also, in front of the hotel, a young Indian boy was offering sexual services. JB made numerous notes and camera recordings, most of them hidden. Before the programme was to be broadcast on 30 October 2000, the Paedophile Association and its members who had been recorded by the hidden camera were contacted by the applicant company and given assurance that they would remain anonymous, when the documentary was shown. Thus, false names would be used and the members’ faces and voices would be blurred. The association unsuccessfully sought an injunction to prevent the broadcast of the programme. The day after the broadcast of the programme, on 31 October 2000, the person named “Mogens” was arrested and charged with sexual offences under sections 222 (1) taken together with sections 224 and 225 of the Penal Code (Straffeloven). The Copenhagen Police (Københavns Politi) had taken an interest in him before the broadcast of the programme and could therefore identify him. Their request that he be detained on remand was refused by the City Court, which found no specific reason to believe that “Mogens” would impede the investigation, notably because the information leading to the charges against him on the whole appeared from the programme. Thus, “Mogens” was released on the same day. During their further investigation, which also included the person in the programme named “Per”, the Copenhagen Police requested that the un-shown portions of the recordings made by JB be disclosed. JB, and the editor and head of the applicant company’s documentary unit, refused the request following which the public prosecution requested a court order compelling the applicant company to hand over the un-shown footage to the police. By decision of 12 February 2001 the Copenhagen City Court (Københavns Byret) refused to grant the requested court order having regard to the need of the media to be able to protect their sources. Also, it found that the raw material had little or no evidential value, as it essentially covered the same matter as the broadcast footage. Moreover, it referred to section 172 of the Administration of Justice Act (Retsplejeloven) and Article 10 of the Convention. On appeal, the decision was upheld on 8 June 2001 by the High Court of Eastern Denmark (Østre Landsret). Having been granted leave to appeal, the public prosecution brought the case before the Supreme Court (Højesteret), which on 29 August 2002 found against the applicant company, so that the latter was compelled to hand over limited specified unedited footage and notes which related solely to “Mogens” and his activities in Denmark and India, including the recordings made outside the Indian hotel of the Indian boy. However, the recordings and notes were exempted from the order whenever the handover would entail a risk of revealing the identity of any of three named persons, namely “the victim [not the Indian boy], the police officer and the hotel manager’s mother”. The remainder of the unedited footage was to remain protected. In its decision the Supreme Court stated as follows: “The Supreme Court agrees that presumably the non-edited recordings and the notes made by the journalist JB may assist the investigation and production of evidence in the case against “Mogens” and that therefore they may serve as evidence within the meaning of section 804, subsection 1, of the Administration of Justice Act. It is undisputed that in connection with the recording, three of the participants - the victim, the police officer and the hotel manager’s mother - were promised that they could participate without the possibility of being identified, thus their identities are protected by the right of exemption from the duty to testify as a witness, pursuant to section 172, subsection 2(ii) first sentence, of the Administration of Justice Act. The charge against “Mogens” concerns a criminal offence which is punishable with four years’ imprisonment or more. The charge includes several instances of sexual relations other than intercourse, over a long time, with boys younger than 15 years of age, and the Supreme Court finds that the case concerns a criminal act, which is of a serious nature. However, having regard to the information about the content of the material which is related to the three participants mentioned [the victim, the police officer and the hotel manager’s mother] compared with the investigation possibilities otherwise available, it cannot be presumed that the material is of vital importance for resolving the case. In these circumstances, the Supreme Court agrees that the conditions stated in section 804, subsection 4, and section 172, subsection 5, of the Administration of Justice Act are not fulfilled for issuing an order [to compel the applicant company to disclose or hand over the material which is related to those three participants] contrary to the right of exemption from the duty to give evidence. The recordings of the members of the Paedophile Association during its meetings and of “Mogens” and “Per” were done with a hidden camera. Hence a promise of anonymity could only be given after the recordings. The media’s extensive privilege of protecting their sources by virtue of section 172 of the Administration of Justice Act has been introduced in consideration of the sources’ and the participants’ opportunity to exercise the freedom of speech, since the promise of anonymity may be a vital premise for supplying a journalist with information. Thus, the main purpose of the rules concerning the right of exemption from the duty to testify as a witness is to protect persons who, relying on a promise of anonymity, agree to participate in a programme. Even though, in compliance with the rules on press ethics and the use of a hidden camera, [the applicant company] has subsequently given the participants a promise and has kept this promise in the programme, section 172, subsection 2(ii), of the Administration of Justice Act cannot, according to its wording and purpose, extend to a right of exemption from the duty to testify as a witness as regards the recordings in question. Nor can section 172, subsection 2(i). The programme contains recordings made outside an Indian hotel of a boy with whom “Mogens” allegedly had had [sexual] relations. The boy’s name does not appear and reasonable precautions have been taken to cover his identity, but this is not sufficient to establish a right of exemption from the duty to give evidence according to section 172, subsection 2, of the Administration of Justice Act. A court order pursuant to section 804 of the Administration of Justice Act may not be issued if it is disproportionate to the importance of the case and the disadvantage which such a ruling might entail (section 805, subsection 1, of the Administration of Justice Act). In this balancing exercise, regard must be had to the nature of the offence, the value which the items may have for the investigation of the case, and considerations for the media’s working conditions as regards Article 10 of the Convention. In these circumstances, the Supreme Court finds that a court order should be limited to those recordings in which “Mogens” or the Indian boy participates, and JB’s notes which relate thereto. ... [The Supreme Court] orders that [the applicant company] hand over those parts of the non-edited tapes with recording for the programme “Danish Paedophiles” in which “Mogens” or the Indian boy participates. Also, [the applicant company] must hand over notes made by the journalist JB in connection with the said recordings. However, the recordings and notes may be exempted from the handover order whenever that would entail a risk of revealing the identity of the victim, the police officer or the hotel manager’s mother.” On 1 April 2003 the Copenhagen Police decided to discontinue its investigation against “Mogens” and drop the charges against him. The provisions of the Administration of Justice Act (Retsplejeloven), in so far as relevant, read as follows: 1. Editors and editorial staff employed by a publication covered by section 1, subsection 1, of the Media Responsibility Act (Medieansvarsloven) are under no obligation to testify as a witness about: the identity of the source of information or the author of an article, or the person who has taken a photograph or procured another figurative production. If publication is made, it is a condition for exemption from the duty to testify as a witness that the source, author, photographer or producer is not identified in the publication. the identity of a person whose picture is shown, or who is the subject of conversation, when such persons have been promised anonymity. If publication is made, exemption from the duty to testify as a witness applies as long as the identity [of the relevant persons] does not appear from the text. 2. Editors and editorial staff employed by a radio or a television enterprise covered by section 1, subsection 2, of the Media Responsibility Act are under no obligation to testify as a witness about: the identity of the source of information or the author of a work, or the person who has taken a photograph or procured another figurative production. If the information, work etc. is broadcast, it is a condition for exemption from the duty to testify as a witness that the source, author, photographer or producer has not been identified in the programme. the identity of participants who were promised that they could participate without the possibility of being identified. If the programme is broadcast, it is a condition for exemption from the duty to testify as a witness that the name of the relevant persons does not appear, and that reasonable precautions have been taken to conceal their identity. 3. ... 4. ... 5. If the case concerns a criminal act of a serious nature, which according to the law is punishable with four years’ imprisonment or more, the court may compel the persons mentioned under subsections 1-4 to testify as witnesses, if such testimony is considered to be of vital importance for resolving the case, and the interest in resolving the case obviously overrides the mass media’s need to protect their sources. 6.... 1. As part of the investigation of a criminal offence, subject to public prosecution, any person who is not a suspect may be compelled to disclose or hand over items (edition) if there is reason to assume that such an item, which that person has possession of, may serve as evidence, ought to be seized, or has been removed during the criminal act from someone who may claim it back... 2. ... 3. ... 4. An order to disclose or hand over items may not be issued if this would result in disclosure of matters about which the person would be excluded from or exempted from testifying as a witness. 5. ... 1. A seizure may not be made, nor may a disclosure or a handover be ordered, if that would be disproportionate to the importance of the case and the loss and disadvantage which such a ruling presumably may entail. 2. ... 3. ... Several international instruments concern the protection of journalistic sources, among others, the Resolution on Journalistic Freedoms and Human Rights, adopted at the 4th European Ministerial Conference on Mass Media Policy (Prague, 7-8 December 1994) and Resolution on the Confidentiality of Journalists’ Sources by the European Parliament, 18 January 1994, Official Journal of the European Communities No. C 44/34). Moreover, Recommendation No. R(2000) 7 on the right of journalists not to disclose their sources of information was adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 8 March 2000 and stated, in so far as relevant: [The Committee of Ministers] Recommends to the governments of member States: 1. to implement in their domestic law and practice the principles appended to this recommendation, 2. to disseminate widely this recommendation and its appended principles, where appropriate accompanied by a translation, and 3. to bring them in particular to the attention of public authorities, police authorities and the judiciary as well as to make them available to journalists, the media and their professional organisations. Appendix to Recommendation No. R (2000) 7 Principles concerning the right of journalists not to disclose their sources of information Definitions For the purposes of this Recommendation: a. the term ""journalist"" means any natural or legal person who is regularly or professionally engaged in the collection and dissemination of information to the public via any means of mass communication; b. the term ""information"" means any statement of fact, opinion or idea in the form of text, sound and/or picture; c. the term ""source"" means any person who provides information to a journalist; d. the term ""information identifying a source"" means, as far as this is likely to lead to the identification of a source: i. the name and personal data as well as voice and image of a source, ii. the factual circumstances of acquiring information from a source by a journalist, iii. the unpublished content of the information provided by a source to a journalist, and iv. personal data of journalists and their employers related to their professional work. Principle 1 (Right of non-disclosure of journalists) Domestic law and practice in member States should provide for explicit and clear protection of the right of journalists not to disclose information identifying a source in accordance with Article 10 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (hereinafter: the Convention) and the principles established herein, which are to be considered as minimum standards for the respect of this right. Principle 2 (Right of non-disclosure of other persons) Other persons who, by their professional relations with journalists, acquire knowledge of information identifying a source through the collection, editorial processing or dissemination of this information, should equally be protected under the principles established herein. Principle 3 (Limits to the right of non-disclosure) a. The right of journalists not to disclose information identifying a source must not be subject to other restrictions than those mentioned in Article 10, paragraph 2 of the Convention. In determining whether a legitimate interest in a disclosure falling within the scope of Article 10, paragraph 2 of the Convention outweighs the public interest in not disclosing information identifying a source, competent authorities of member States shall pay particular regard to the importance of the right of non-disclosure and the pre-eminence given to it in the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, and may only order a disclosure if, subject to paragraph b, there exists an overriding requirement in the public interest and if circumstances are of a sufficiently vital and serious nature. b. The disclosure of information identifying a source should not be deemed necessary unless it can be convincingly established that: i. reasonable alternative measures to the disclosure do not exist or have been exhausted by the persons or public authorities that seek the disclosure, and ii. the legitimate interest in the disclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in the non-disclosure, bearing in mind that: - an overriding requirement of the need for disclosure is proved, - the circumstances are of a sufficiently vital and serious nature, - the necessity of the disclosure is identified as responding to a pressing social need, and - member States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing this need, but this margin goes hand in hand with the supervision by the European Court of Human Rights. c. The above requirements should be applied at all stages of any proceedings where the right of non-disclosure might be invoked. Principle 4 (Alternative evidence to journalists’ sources) In legal proceedings against a journalist on grounds of an alleged infringement of the honour or reputation of a person, authorities should consider, for the purpose of establishing the truth or otherwise of the allegation, all evidence which is available to them under national procedural law and may not require for that purpose the disclosure of information identifying a source by the journalist. Principle 5 (Conditions concerning disclosures) a. The motion or request for initiating any action by competent authorities aimed at the disclosure of information identifying a source should only be introduced by persons or public authorities that have a direct legitimate interest in the disclosure. b. Journalists should be informed by the competent authorities of their right not to disclose information identifying a source as well as of the limits of this right before a disclosure is requested. c. Sanctions against journalists for not disclosing information identifying a source should only be imposed by judicial authorities during court proceedings which allow for a hearing of the journalists concerned in accordance with Article 6 of the Convention. d. Journalists should have the right to have the imposition of a sanction for not disclosing their information identifying a source reviewed by another judicial authority. e. Where journalists respond to a request or order to disclose information identifying a source, the competent authorities should consider applying measures to limit the extent of a disclosure, for example by excluding the public from the disclosure with due respect to Article 6 of the Convention, where relevant, and by themselves respecting the confidentiality of such a disclosure. Principle 6 (Interception of communication, surveillance and judicial search and seizure) a. The following measures should not be applied if their purpose is to circumvent the right of journalists, under the terms of these principles, not to disclose information identifying a source: i. interception orders or actions concerning communication or correspondence of journalists or their employers, ii. surveillance orders or actions concerning journalists, their contacts or their employers, or iii. search or seizure orders or actions concerning the private or business premises, belongings or correspondence of journalists or their employers or personal data related to their professional work. b. Where information identifying a source has been properly obtained by police or judicial authorities by any of the above actions, although this might not have been the purpose of these actions, measures should be taken to prevent the subsequent use of this information as evidence before courts, unless the disclosure would be justified under Principle 3. Principle 7 (Protection against self-incrimination) The principles established herein shall not in any way limit national laws on the protection against self-incrimination in criminal proceedings, and journalists should, as far as such laws apply, enjoy such protection with regard to the disclosure of information identifying a source. For the precise application of the Recommendation, the explanatory notes specified the meaning of certain terms. As regards the term “sources” the following was set out: c. Source 17. Any person who provides information to a journalist shall be considered as his or her ""source"". The protection of the relationship between a journalist and a source is the goal of this Recommendation, because of the ""potentially chilling effect"" an order of source disclosure has on the exercise of freedom of the media (see, Eu. Court H.R., Goodwin v. the United Kingdom, 27 March 1996, para. 39). Journalists may receive their information from all kinds of sources. Therefore, a wide interpretation of this term is necessary. The actual provision of information to journalists can constitute an action on the side of the source, for example when a source calls or writes to a journalist or sends to him or her recorded information or pictures. Information shall also be regarded as being ""provided"" when a source remains passive and consents to the journalist taking the information, such as the filming or recording of information with the consent of the source.”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicant party is a political party. 11. On 20 November 2003 the Central Electoral Commission (“the CEC”) announced the final results of the votes in the regularly scheduled parliamentary election of 2 November 2003, according to which seven parties had cleared the 7% legal threshold required by Article 105 § 6 of the Electoral Code (“the EC”, see paragraph 44 below). The opposition party, the SaakashviliNational Movement, took third place with 18.04% of the vote (giving them 32 seats in Parliament), followed by the applicant party with 12.04% of the vote (20 seats) and the United Democrats, a coalition led by the President of the Parliament, Ms N. Burjanadze, with 8.79% of the vote (15 seats). 12. On account of numerous instances of ballot fraud reported by election observers, the SaakashviliNational Movement and the United Democrats refused to accept the election results. With general support from the population, they called for President Shevardnadze’s resignation. When the newly elected parliament convened for its first session on 22 November 2003, the opposition forces broke into the parliament building, disrupted the President’s inaugural speech and ousted the members of parliament (MPs). 13. On 23 November 2003 Mr E. Shevardnadze resigned and Ms N. Burjanadze became the interim President of Georgia, as provided for by the Constitution. Those events were later referred to as the “Rose Revolution”. 14. As the parliament elected in November 2003 had been ousted by the revolutionary forces, the interim leadership recalled the previous parliament elected in 1999 (see Article 50 § 4 of the Constitution, paragraph 42 below) until such time as a new parliament was elected. 15. On 25 November 2003 the Supreme Court of Georgia annulled the CEC vote tally of 20 November 2003 in the part concerning the election results under the proportional system. The results in single-seat constituencies remained in force. 16. On 28 November 2003 the Chairman of the CEC, who had been appointed by ex-President Shevardnadze, resigned. On 30 November 2003 the interim President dismissed five members of the CEC who had been appointed by the ex-President, and Parliament elected a new Chairman of the CEC on the basis of a candidature proposed by the interim President. 17. In view of the partial annulment of the election results of the initial parliamentary election of 2 November 2003 by the Supreme Court on 25 November 2003, on 2 December 2003 the CEC Chairman issued Ordinance no. 167/2003 which, under Article 106 § 4 of the EC, set the date of the repeat parliamentary election (“the repeat election”) for 25 January 2004. On the same day, however, the CEC Chairman applied to the interim President of Georgia (Decree no. 50/2003), requesting that a later date be set for the election, arguing that it would hardly be possible to ensure its proper administration within such a short time frame. This application was finally granted on 9 January 2004 and the repeat election was scheduled for 28 March 2004 by the interim President. 18. The applicant party challenged CEC Ordinance no. 167/2003 in court, claiming that the CEC had erroneously relied on Article 106 § 4 instead of Article 105 § 17 of the EC when setting the date for the repeat election. By a judgment of 8 December 2003, the Tbilisi Regional Court dismissed the claim, reasoning that the applicant party lacked victim status. That judgment was quashed on 26 December 2003 by the Supreme Court which noted that, since the applicant party was running for election, there was a direct and consequential link between its interests and the decisions of the CEC. However, the Supreme Court dismissed the claim as manifestly illfounded. 19. On 7, 9 and 12 December 2003 the CEC issued Ordinances by which voters were required to attend electoral precincts and fill out special forms; this would enable them to cast their ballots during the presidential election of 4 January 2004. 20. Along with other opposition parties, the applicant party challenged the lawfulness of those rules in court. On 15 December 2003 the Tbilisi Regional Court dismissed the claim as unsubstantiated. With regard to the applicant party, the court stated that it lacked victim status as it had failed to show what direct and specific harm the preliminary voter registration procedure for the presidential election could possibly have caused to its interests. 21. On 15 January 2004 Mr M. Saakashvili was declared President of Georgia. By an Ordinance of 31 January 2004, the new President appointed five members of the CEC, one of whom was given authority to appoint five members in the District Electoral Commissions (“the DECs”) under Article 128(1) § 4 of the EC. 22. Nineteen political parties and blocs were registered by the CEC on 21 February 2004 as candidates for the repeat parliamentary election, including the applicant party and the ruling coalition of the President’s National Movement and Ms Burjanadze’s United Democrats. The presidential National Movement had previously won the 2002 municipal elections in Tbilisi. 23. For the purposes of the repeat election, the CEC passed another decree on 27 February 2004 (Decree no. 30/2004), pursuant to which the Precinct Electoral Commissions (“the PECs”) had to post preliminary lists of voters in their bureaux, data which had been gathered in the course of the preliminary registration of voters for the presidential election. Between 8 and 21 March 2004, voters were to attend the electoral precincts again to verify that their names were on the lists. If a voter found that he or she was missing from the list, a petition for correction was to be filed with the relevant PEC. On 21 March 2004 the PECs were to send corrected versions of the preliminary electoral rolls to the relevant DEC, which was required to produce final electoral rolls and remit them to the PECs for a further public examination. Between 23 and 27 March 2004, voters were to recheck the final lists and request corrections if necessary. The Decree also envisaged adding the names of voters who had not been included in the preliminary registration to the lists on election day itself. 24. The rationale behind the introduction of this system of voter registration was explained by the CEC Chairman in a public statement: “If a voter does not want to participate in the election, does not engage in politics, does not want to cooperate with the State, then the State is also under no obligation to ensure that this voter is on the unified electoral roll.” 25. The repeat election, based on the system of proportional representation, was held as planned on 28 March 2004. Numerous complaints about irregularities on election day were subsequently filed with electoral commissions, including the CEC, and with the courts. 26. On 2 April 2004 the CEC issued Ordinance no. 82/2004, which annulled the election results for all the PECs in the Khulo and Kobuleti electoral districts (nos. 81 and 84) in the Ajarian Autonomous Republic (“the AAR”), where 42,011 and 17,263 voters were registered respectively. The CEC Ordinance did not explain which legal provision had entitled it to take this annulment decision. It simply noted that complaints had been filed about voting irregularities in these two districts. The complaints requested that the investigative measures envisaged by Article 105 § 13 of the EC be undertaken by the CEC. However, “in view of the nature of the irregularities alleged in the complaints”, there was, according to the CEC, no point in resorting to such measures. Consequently, the challenged election results in the Khulo and Kobuleti districts were to be annulled and, in accordance with Article 105 § 12 of the EC, the polls were to be repeated there. The new date was set for 18 April 2004 (for more details, see paragraphs 50 and 53 below). 27. On 6 April 2004 the CEC issued rules of procedure (Decree no. 45/2004) for the posting of electoral rolls in the various precincts of the Khulo and Kobuleti districts. As before the presidential election of 4 January 2004 and the repeat parliamentary election of 28 March 2004, voters were expected to pay preliminary visits to the precincts in order to ensure that their names were on the lists. 28. On 18 April 2004, election day, the polling stations in the Khulo and Kobuleti districts failed to open (see paragraph 50 below). On the same day, however, the CEC tallied the votes in the repeat election of 28 March 2004. It stated that 1,498,012 votes had been cast, while 2,343,087 voters had registered. The applicant party received 6.01% of the vote, which was not enough to clear the 7% threshold and thus to obtain seats in Parliament. 29. According to the minutes of the CEC meeting of 18 April 2004, the applicant party’s representative, as one of the fifteen members of the CEC, objected to the finalisation of the election results. The representative argued that the CEC could not lawfully end the countrywide election without first having held an election in the Khulo and Kobuleti districts. The Chairman of the CEC replied that the fact that the polling stations had not opened in those districts was the fault of the Ajarian authorities. He also added that, even if the election had been conducted in those districts, this would not have affected the final results. By a majority vote, the Chairman’s proposal to approve the vote tally was accepted and the relevant Ordinance (no. 94/2004) was adopted on the basis of Articles 64 and 105 of the EC. 30. On 22 April 2004 the newly elected parliament convened for its first session. After several weeks of tension, the Head of the AAR, Mr A. Abashidze, stepped down on 6 May 2004, fleeing the country. 31. On 20 April 2004 the applicant party appealed to the Supreme Court against Ordinance no. 94/2004 (see paragraph 29 above). Alongside the main claim for annulment of the Ordinance in question, the applicant party asked the court to apply an interim measure whereby Parliament would be forbidden from convening for its first session until the dispute had been resolved. The applicant party argued that, if Parliament convened, it would become impossible to enforce the judgment should the court find in the applicant party’s favour. On 20 April 2004 the Supreme Court declared the claim admissible but refused to apply the requested interim measure. It reasoned that the claim could not have any suspensive effect under Article 77 § 3 of the EC and noted that, pursuant to Article 51 of the Constitution, the first sitting of a newly elected parliament was to be held within twenty days of the finalisation of the election results. 32. The applicant party submitted four major arguments to the Supreme Court, which dismissed its claim on 26 April 2004. 33. Firstly, the applicant party challenged the rules on the composition of electoral rolls. It claimed that many eligible voters who had failed to comply with the procedure for preliminary registration had been refused the right to cast their votes on election day. At the same time, the obligation to register in advance had created a kind of carousel to facilitate ballot fraud in which some voters could register in different electoral precincts and thus cast their vote more than once. As a result of those irregularities, the applicant party claimed that it had lost votes. It also complained that the CEC had not had competence to change the rules on the composition of electoral rolls, this prerogative being reserved solely for Parliament, which alone was entitled to make the relevant legislative amendments to the EC. In the applicant party’s view, the fact that many voters had been refused the right to vote because of the new rules, and that the Government had total control over the electoral administration, had allowed the election results to be rigged. Based on statistical data about high voting activity across the country at particular times, provided by its representatives in the electoral commissions of the Kvemo Kartli, MeskhetJavakheti and Ajarian regions, the applicant party claimed that vote-riggers had fraudulently cast around 500,000 ballots in favour of the presidential and pro-presidential parties at 12 noon, 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. on election day. 34. The Supreme Court found the latter allegation unsubstantiated, reasoning that the applicant party had submitted no relevant evidence in support of it. As to the voter registration rules, the court noted that the CEC had issued Decree no. 30/2004 (see paragraph 23 above) by which it had remedied the deficiency of Article 9 § 12 of the EC, the effect of which had been suspended by the Constitutional Court on 26 December 2003 (see paragraph 45 below). Since that Ordinance allowed voter registration on the day of election, the allegation that the voters who had missed preliminary registration deadlines were subsequently denied the right to vote was held to be ill-founded. 35. Secondly, the applicant party complained that its representatives at various levels in the electoral commissions had been prevented by other members from fulfilling their duties properly. They had been threatened and instructed not to write complaints about violations observed, namely when votes cast in favour of the Georgian Labour Party were attributed to the presidential and pro-presidential parties. The applicant party complained that such permissive conduct was due to the composition of the electoral commissions, since, in every commission at all levels, eight out of the fifteen members were representatives of the presidential and propresidential parties. 36. Thirdly, the applicant party argued that the impugned Ordinance of 18 April 2004 was contrary to Article 105 § 19 of the EC, since it did not specify the total number of voters and the number of votes cast in each district. 37. In reply to these latter arguments, the Supreme Court reasoned that the applicant party should first have complained about the threats to its representatives before a district court. However, it gave no response to the complaint about the pro-presidential composition of the electoral commissions. As to the CEC’s failure to include information in the Ordinance about the total number of voters and the number of votes cast in each district, the court stated that this was not a gross violation of electoral legislation and could not therefore be regarded as grounds for invalidating that administrative act. 38. Lastly, the applicant party claimed that the finalisation of the countrywide election results without elections being held in the Khulo and Kobuleti districts had been unlawful. In view of the fact that there were at least 60,000 voters in those districts and that the applicant party needed only 16,000 votes in order to clear the 7% legal threshold, it complained that it had been unlawfully deprived of a genuine chance to obtain seats in Parliament. It noted that the Georgian Labour Party was, by and large, supported in the Ajarian constituency. 39. The Supreme Court replied as follows: “It is true that the repeat parliamentary election results were annulled in the Khulo and Kobuleti electoral districts and the CEC called a new repeat election by its Ordinance ... [of 2 April 2004]. However, due to well-known events [tensions between the central and local authorities], the election was not held ... in those districts on account of factual circumstances, this being a ground for the annulment of an administrative act [the CEC Ordinance of 2 April 2004] under Article 60 § 1 (g) of the General Administrative Code of Georgia.” Relying on Article 105 § 3 of the EC, the Supreme Court decided that the repeat election could be considered as having been held, since, according to the vote tally, more than a third of the total number of voters had taken part in it. 40. Acting as a private individual, the Chairman of the applicant party challenged CEC Decree no. 30/2004 of 27 February 2004 (the rules on the composition of electoral rolls) and Ordinance no. 94/2004 of 18 April 2004 (the vote tally) before the Constitutional Court. He claimed that the system of preliminary voter registration, the disfranchisement of the Khulo and Kobuleti constituencies and the presidential control of the electoral administration had infringed the constitutional principle of free and fair elections. 41. On 25 May 2004 the Constitutional Court declared the claim inadmissible. It reasoned that, since it was not a normative act, the disputed Ordinance could not be challenged before the Constitutional Court. As to the impugned Decree, it considered that, firstly, the claimant had failed to substantiate how this normative act had infringed any of his constitutional rights. Secondly, it stated that the claimant, as a private person, did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the election, this right being reserved by section 37 of the Constitutional Court Act for the President of Georgia and a specific number of MPs. “The mandate of the previous Parliament shall cease immediately after the first meeting of the newly elected Parliament.” “The first sitting of the newly elected Parliament shall be held within twenty days of the elections. The day of the first sitting shall be determined by the President. Parliament shall begin its work when the election of two-thirds of the members of parliament has been confirmed.” Article 60 § 1 (c) – “A void legal-administrative act” “A legal-administrative act shall be void as from its adoption if its implementation is impossible for factual reasons.” “1. The general electoral roll is a list of persons with active electoral rights, who are registered in accordance with the law ... 5. The general list of voters shall be compiled ... on the basis of the data available at the territorial agencies of the Georgian Ministry for the Interior, ... data available at the corresponding agencies of the Ministry of Justice, ... data from local selfgovernment and/or administrative agencies, ... data on internally displaced persons communicated by the Ministry of Refugees and Settlement or by its territorial agencies, ... data communicated by the Ministries of Defence, the Interior and State Security, the State Department of State Border Protection and the Special State Protection Service, ... [and] data communicated by Georgian consular authorities ... 7. A registered party ... and voters ... shall be entitled to consult the public version of the general list available at the Central, District and Precinct Electoral Commissions (an elector having the right to consult only the data concerning his/her person and his/her family members ...) and, in the event of any inaccuracy, to request – not later than twenty-three days prior to the date of the election – that the appropriate amendments be made to the voters’ data and the electoral roll ... 8. The electoral administration shall, on its own initiative or following an application under § 7 of this Article, review the general electoral roll ... A decision by the District Electoral Commission rejecting [petitions for] amendments to the voters’ data and electoral roll shall be reasoned and, if requested, transmitted to the applicant from the day following its adoption. 12. [The above-mentioned decision] can be appealed to the competent district/city court within two days of its adoption. Where the court rules in favour of the applicant, the ruling shall, within three days but no later than by the thirteenth day prior to the election date, be delivered to the District Electoral Commission, which shall immediately furnish the relevant information to the Central Electoral Commission ... Electoral commissions shall immediately make the appropriate amendments to the electoral rolls ... It is prohibited to make amendments to the electoral roll in the last ten days prior to the election date; from the nineteenth to the tenth day before [the election date], amendments shall be made only by a court ruling.” The application of several provisions of Article 9 regulating the timelimits for compiling and examining electoral rolls, including § 12, was suspended on 26 December 2003 by the Constitutional Court. Finally, § 12 was invalidated on 24 January 2005 by the same court (see paragraph 45 below). Under Article 10 § 1, the special list of voters included (a) electoral administration officers who, on election day, were working in an electoral precinct other than that of their residence; (b) voters who, on election day, were being treated in hospital or another in-patient centre; (c) voters who, on election day, were being held in police custody or pre-trial detention; (d) voters who were at sea on election day (they are enrolled at the relevant vessel’s port of registration); and (e) voters who were abroad on election day and registered at the relevant Georgian consulate as well as voters who were not on the consular register, but had registered in a PEC formed abroad or in a consulate. Article 10 §§ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 stipulated that the head of the appropriate institution with responsibility for the voters referred to Article 10 § 1 was to compile the special list, be responsible for the accuracy of the data entered on it, which was to be attested by his/her signature, and was to deliver it to the competent electoral commission. “1. The electoral administration of Georgia is a legal entity of public law, which is established in accordance with this Law and shall exercise public authority within the limits specified by it. ... 3. The electoral administration is independent, within the limits of its competence, from other State institutions. 4. The electoral administration is a centralised system composed of the Central Electoral Commission of Georgia [CEC], ... District Electoral Commissions [DECs], [and] Precinct Electoral Commissions [PECs] ... The CEC is the supreme body of the electoral administration of Georgia. ... 6. The CEC is accountable to the Parliament of Georgia ...” “A member of the electoral administration may not join a party, and if he [or she] was a party member, [that person] must withdraw from the party or suspend his [or her] membership for the term of office in the electoral administration ...” “... 7. The decision of an electoral commission shall be considered to have been adopted if it is supported by the majority of the votes cast (unless the Law requires a higher quorum), but not less than one third of the commission members. 8. If the vote is tied, the chairman of the session shall have the casting vote. ... 13. The CEC shall adopt decrees by two-thirds of its members. No decree shall be adopted less than four days before the election date.” Pursuant to Articles 34 § 2 (f), 61 § 5, 62 and 63 §§ 1 and 4, a DEC was competent to receive, examine and decide on requests for a recount or to annul election results in the relevant precincts, based on allegations of voting irregularities. “1. No later than eighteen days after the date of the ballot, the CEC, based on the protocols received from the DECs and PECs, shall consolidate the results of the parliamentary and presidential elections ... and approve by its Ordinance the final protocol of the vote tally. 1(1) The CEC is prohibited from finalising the election results before the resolution of election-related disputes in the courts of general jurisdiction and without consideration of the outcome of those disputes. ... The CEC shall consolidate the election results and determine: (a) the total number of voters; (b) the turnout of voters; (c) the number of ballots deemed invalid; ... and (e) the number of votes received by candidates.” “Lodging appeals with a court shall not have a suspensive effect on the decision.” Under Article 100 § 2, a party or bloc could cancel the nomination of one of its candidates even after the latter’s authority as an MP had been officially recognised. “... 3. An election held under the proportional system shall be considered to have been held if at least one-third of the total number of voters took part in it. ... 6. Seats in Parliament shall be awarded only to party lists that receive no less than 7% of the votes cast. 7. In order to determine the number of seats received by a party list, the number of votes received by this list must be multiplied by 150 and divided by the total number of the votes received by the parties [which cleared the 7% threshold] ... 12. If, due to gross violation of the present law, the voting results are deemed invalid in more than half of the electoral precincts, or in ... precincts where the total number of voters represents more than 50% of the total number of voters in the electoral district concerned, the election results for the entire electoral district shall be deemed invalid and the CEC shall set a date for a repeat election. 13. If any application, complaint or dissenting opinion by a DEC member is submitted requesting revision or invalidation of the voting results, the CEC shall take a decision by passing an Ordinance for or against the opening of packages and the recounting of ballot papers (special envelopes) received from the relevant PEC. The CEC is empowered to collate the election results based on the PEC protocols. ... 16. A second ballot under the proportional representation system shall be held when the total number of voters in the precincts [where the voting results were invalidated] is more than 10% of the total number of voters in Georgia. In such cases, the second ballot shall be held within two weeks of the general election. 17. If the election under the proportional representation system is declared to have been held but none of the parties or electoral blocs have managed to clear the required threshold, a repeat election shall be held within two weeks of the general election, by Ordinance of the CEC. 18. Only those parties and electoral blocs which received 2% of the votes in the general election shall have the right to take part in the repeat election. The party lists ... shall remain unchanged. Amendments to them may be introduced only in accordance with the general rules established by this Law. 19. The summary protocol of the final election returns must disclose the names and numbers of those electoral districts and precincts in which the election was declared invalid, as well as the number of voters in them, the reason for declaring the election invalid, the total number of voters in each electoral district, the turnout of voters, [and] the number of members of parliament elected, with their names listed in alphabetical order.” “... 3. If an election is declared ‘not held’, or if the election results are deemed invalid in a multi-seat electoral district, a repeat election shall be held. If the mandate of the parliamentarian elected in such a district is suspended before its term, a mid-term election shall be held. 4. The repeat election shall be held within two months ... The CEC shall set the election date and time-limits for electoral arrangements by Ordinance no later than seven days after the initial election ... 7. If an MP who resigns was elected through the party list of a party participating independently in the elections, the seat of such an MP shall be occupied within one month by the next candidate on the same list, provided that that candidate agrees to become an MP within fifteen days of the vacancy arising. Otherwise the vacant seat shall be occupied by the next candidate on the list, etc. If there is no other candidate named in the party list, the parliamentary mandate shall be deemed cancelled.” Unlike the parliamentary election under the majority system, neither Article 106 nor any other provision of the EC provided for the possibility of conducting mid-term, repeat or other types of interim polls as under the proportional system after the countrywide election results had been finalised by the CEC (see paragraph 118 below). An amendment to the EC, introducing provisional Articles 128, 128(1) and 128(2), was enacted on 5 August 2003 for the specific purpose of re-forming the CEC for the regular parliamentary election of 2003. Pursuant to Article 128 § 2, the CEC was to be composed of fifteen members and its sessions were considered to be valid if attended by more than half of the members. Article 128 § 3 initially stated that the chairman of the CEC was to be appointed by Parliament following his or her nomination by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). However, this provision was amended on 28 November 2003 and, under the new rule, the chairman was to be appointed by the President of Georgia, with the approval of Parliament. Article 128 § 4 further established that five members of the CEC were also to be appointed by the President. Pursuant to Article 128 § 5, the remaining nine members of the CEC were to be appointed as follows: (a) three members by the party/electoral bloc which had come second in the parliamentary election of 1999; (b) two members by the party/electoral bloc which had come third in the parliamentary election of 1999; and (c) one member by each of the four parties/electoral blocs which had obtained the best results in the 2002 local election in Tbilisi, held under the proportional electoral system, unless that party/electoral bloc was entitled to appoint a commission member under the preceding subparagraphs (a) and (b). Pursuant to Articles 128(1) § 2 and 128(2) § 2, the composition of the DECs and PECs was similar to that of the CEC. The chairman of the DEC was appointed by the President of Georgia with the approval of Parliament (Article 128(1) § 3), while the chairman of the PEC was appointed by the chairman of the corresponding DEC (Article 128(2) § 3). Five members of the DECs were appointed by one of the members of the CEC who had been appointed by the President of Georgia and granted this power by him or her (Article 128(1) § 4). Five members of the PECs were appointed by one of the five members of the corresponding DEC, appointed in accordance with Article 128(1) § 4. By an amendment of 22 April 2005, the provisional rules under Articles 128, 128(1) and 128(2), as described above, were annulled. 45. Following an application by two voters, on 26 December 2003 the Constitutional Court suspended the effect of Article 9 §§ 7, 8, 10 and 12 and Article 10 §§ 1 (e) and 6 of the EC in the part regulating the time-limits for adding and revising voters’ names on electoral rolls. On 24 January 2005 the Constitutional Court invalidated Article 9 § 12 of the EC, upholding the constitutionality of the rest of the disputed provisions. The relevant part of the judgment provides as follows: “... The registration of voters through the unified electoral roll is what provides citizens with the basis for exercising their right to vote. Consequently, under the disputed provision the right to vote is being denied to those citizens who do not find their names on the roll and are unable to register during the ten days preceding the election date, whereas a court ruling is necessary for registration between the nineteenth and tenth day prior to the election ... The registration of voters is the responsibility of the relevant State authorities. When a citizen’s name is not found on the electoral roll, this is [the State authorities’] omission and should not limit the citizen’s right to vote. The Electoral Code should secure not merely formal but real mechanisms that would enable the exercise of the constitutional right.” 46. The relevant provisions of the Resolution provide as follows: “... 7. ... [T]he Assembly asks the Georgian authorities to adopt without delay a number of measures, which must be fully implemented when the forthcoming parliamentary elections are held on 28 March 2004, in particular: (i) to amend the Electoral Code and all other electoral legislation and regulations, ... so as to: (a) modify the composition of the Central Electoral Commission and the electoral commissions at lower levels, in order to promote the principle of balanced, fair and equal representation of all political forces; ... (c) ensure a clear segregation between governmental structures and the electoral authorities, and introduce a principle that the latter must be completely impartial; ... (ii) to revise the electoral rolls, and create as soon as possible a single, centralised and computerised register of electors, and to put an end to the practice of registering voters’ names on supplementary lists on election day itself, a practice which entails a considerable risk of fraud. 8. The Assembly also declares its concern about the current reshaping of Georgian political life and the risk of the disappearance of all parliamentary opposition after the forthcoming elections and, in consequence, of any true institutional counterweight. If the elections were to culminate in the sole representation in Parliament of the ruling coalition, the Assembly might fear for the future of democratic pluralism in Georgia. It therefore recommends that the Georgian authorities amend the corresponding legislation so as to reduce the electoral threshold in the proportional representation system from 7% to at least 5%.” 47. The Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters was adopted by the Venice Commission at its 51st Plenary Session (5-6 July 2002) and submitted to the PACE on 6 November 2002. Its relevant provisions provide as follows: 2. “Regulatory levels and the stability of electoral law” “(a) Apart from rules on technical matters and detail – which may be included in the regulations of the executive –, rules of electoral law must have at least the rank of a statute. (b) The fundamental elements of electoral law, in particular the electoral system proper, membership of electoral commissions and the drawing of constituency boundaries, should not be open to amendment less than one year before an election, or should be written in the constitution or at a level higher than ordinary law.” 3.1. “The organisation of elections by an impartial body” “(a) An impartial body must be in charge of applying electoral law. (b) Where there is no long-standing tradition of administrative authorities’ independence from those holding political power, independent, impartial electoral commissions must be set up at all levels, from the national level to polling station level. (c) The central electoral commission must be permanent in nature. (d) It should include: (i) at least one member of the judiciary; (ii) representatives of parties already in Parliament or having scored at least a given percentage of the vote; these persons must be qualified in electoral matters. It may include: (iii) a representative of the Ministry of the Interior; (iv) representatives of national minorities. (e) Political parties must be equally represented on electoral commissions or must be able to observe the work of the impartial body. Equality may be construed strictly or on a proportional basis ... (f) The bodies appointing members of electoral commissions must not be free to dismiss them at will. (g) Members of electoral commissions must receive standard training. (h) It is desirable that electoral commissions take decisions by a qualified majority or by consensus.” 48. A selected passage from the Venice Commission’s Report on Electoral Law and Electoral Administration in Europe, issued on 9-10 June 2006, provides as follows: “34. Although in many countries the influence of the executive government on the composition of the electoral commissions has, in general, greatly been reduced, in a few States still a significant number of commission members are nominated and appointed by the executive government, e.g. the President of the Republic or the Ministry of the Interior or Justice. For example, in Georgia five (out of fifteen) members of the Central Electoral Commission are appointed by the President, not including those members appointed by the governing parties in Parliament. To avoid the risk of governmental interference in the commission’s work, as a rule the number of commission members nominated and appointed by the executive government should, if at all, be very low.” 49. The relevant excerpts from the Report read as follows: “Preliminary voter registers released in early October contained significant anomalies and errors. The number of voters registered in a number of individual districts showed a wide variation from previous elections ... Inaccurate lists were of concern not only because errors could deny eligible citizens the right to vote but ... increased the possibility of election fraud. Reports on errors in voter lists included: omitting entire apartment blocks or streets; voters being listed in the wrong districts; listing many deceased persons; and large numbers of duplicate entries. Despite the enormity of the task, many PECs worked conscientiously to rectify errors. However, some DECs failed to supply the PECs with voter lists, and many PECs appeared unfamiliar with new registration procedures and applied inconsistent methods. Many failed to display lists in a systematic or practical manner ... Other problems included: a 2,250-page list of deceased persons in Tbilisi that was unusable as it was not broken down by district or precinct; IDP [internally displaced person] voters not being systematically included in lists; and significant numbers of voters lacking ID documents ... Unexpectedly, on 26 October, the CEC decided to cease work on the central database altogether, thereby jettisoning the effort to improve the accuracy and transparency of voter registers. The PECs were permitted to use either handwritten or computerised lists. This decision dramatically altered the voter registration framework and caused a complete lack of uniformity in the type of list used.” 50. This Report was submitted by the respondent Government as part of their observations. Selected passages from its summary provide as follows: “Conditions in the Autonomous Republic of Ajaria were once again not conducive to democratic elections. Intimidation and physical abuse of opposition supporters and journalists underlined the democratic deficit in Ajaria evident during this election process, effectively creating a dual standard for elections in Georgia. The CEC administered these elections in a credible and professional manner. However, at times the CEC appeared to exceed its authority, for example, by extending legal deadlines or modifying other legal provisions through decrees. Several aspects of the election process were improved over previous elections, although some CEC decisions in the post-election period cast doubts about its impartiality. Voter registers were further improved and consolidated in a computerised database ... However, further efforts are needed to complete voter lists, correct remaining errors, and improve their accuracy. The lack of political balance on election commissions remained a source of concern. Some DECs and PECs failed to maintain appropriate distance from the ruling parties, and some local authorities interfered in the work of lower-level election commissions. President Mikheil Saakashvili’s offer to reduce the number of his appointees on the DECs and PECs from five to three addressed some of these concerns. However, these changes came late in the electoral process and should have been extended to the CEC. ... The tabulation of results at district level was marred by irregularities in a number of DECs. In some cases, election material was delivered unsealed or inadequately secured, protocols were completed or changed at the DEC level, and in at least one case, the DEC members ‘negotiated’ the results. The handling of electionrelated complaints at some DECs was also inadequate. An analysis of the PEC results made available by the CEC showed a number of anomalous or implausible results in a significant minority of districts. Such anomalies included: a rapid increase in voter turnout during the last three hours of voting; an implausible voter turnout, in some cases exceeding 100%, and sometimes coupled with a share of the vote for the ruling parties in excess of 95%; and instances of an unusually high percentage of invalid votes. A total of fifty-two polling stations were invalidated by the DECs due to irregularities. The CEC cancelled the results in two districts in Ajaria (Khulo and Kobuleti) and ordered repeat elections for 18 April, which did not take place due to security reasons. The CEC’s decision to cancel the results and repeat elections in entire districts appeared to be based on questionable legal arguments. Overall, the following elements marked positive developments for the election process: • improvements in the administration of the election process; • the enhanced professionalism and openness of the CEC; • commendable efforts to improve, computerise and consolidate the voter lists, although they remain incomplete; • with the exception of Ajaria, a peaceful and free pre-election period, although there was a late and very limited campaign; • freedom of expression enjoyed by the media, with the exception of Ajaria; ... However, some aspects of the process need to be addressed in order to remedy issues of concern and continue forward progress, including: • the continuing lack of a clear separation between State administration and political party structures, and the ongoing potential for misuse of State administrative resources; • the inability to ensure the balanced composition of election commissions at all levels; • the interference by some local authorities in the functioning of a number of lowerlevel commissions, thereby lessening their independence; • continuing irregularities in some polling stations, as indicated by implausible and anomalous results; • irregularities at a relatively high number of DECs during the tabulation process, and the failure of some DECs to properly address complaints after election day; • the adoption of some decisions by the CEC, such as the cancellation of results in two entire districts, which seem of questionable legality and could be perceived as having been politically motivated ...” 51. With regard to the new system of voter registration, the Report noted as follows: “The CEC implemented a number of recommendations made by the OSCE/ODIHR in previous reports, including: ... • consolidating the voter list into a central, computerised database; • providing an additional period for citizens to register to vote and for a periodic display of newly-printed voter lists ... The number of registered voters under-represented the number of eligible voters, partly because an active system of voter registration was instituted in December and again in March. Under an active system, citizens unwilling or unable to register are excluded from the lists ... [T]he CEC began the consolidation of handwritten voter lists into a single computerised database. The accuracy of this data was verified, and many errors were eliminated. The CEC produced voter lists according to the language in which they were originally compiled, which increased the transparency of the process for non-Georgian speaking voters ... While observers expressed increased confidence in the voter lists, particularly compared to November 2003, shortcomings were noted ... After the election, the CEC announced that some 145,000 voters had registered to vote on election day, bringing the total number of registered voters to 2,343,087.” 52. The Report gave an account of the tensions between the central and Ajarian authorities on the eve of the repeat parliamentary election of 28 March 2004: “The situation in the [AAR] remained tense, especially after a state of emergency was imposed on 23 November. The state of emergency decreased civil liberties, and consequently limited even further the campaign opportunities for parties in opposition to Ajarian leader Aslan Abashidze. Relations between the Georgian government and the Ajarian authorities deteriorated following the November events. On 14 March, President Saakashvili was denied entry into Ajaria, where he intended to campaign. The Georgian government reacted by imposing economic sanctions on Ajaria, and tensions mounted significantly. The situation seemed to improve after an agreement was reached during a meeting between Saakashvili and Abashidze on 18 March. However, the partial implementation of the agreement did not significantly reduce the tension prior to the elections ... Opposition gatherings were violently suppressed or attacked by supporters of the Ajarian authorities ... Offices of parties in opposition to the Ajarian authorities and of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) were ransacked, opposition activists and journalists were assaulted or abducted, and members of election commissions were intimidated. While incidents of violence and intimidation also marred previous elections in Ajaria, the intensity and frequency with which they occurred this time was higher. Overall, the environment in Ajaria was once again not conducive to a meaningful democratic contest during this election process.” 53. The Report also commented on the situation surrounding the CEC’s decision of 2 April 2004 to cancel the election results in the Khulo and Kobuleti districts and call for repeat polls in those districts: “On 2 April, the CEC decided to annul the district-wide election results in Khulo and Kobuleti and repeat polling in these two districts on 18 April. In addition, the CEC dismissed the entire membership of the two DECs and created two temporary groups composed of CEC members and CEC staff members to organise the repeat elections. On 12 April, the CEC temporary groups were dispatched to Ajaria but they rapidly encountered active resistance. On 13-14 April, the temporary groups were forced to leave the Ajarian territory by crowds of people. On the same day, the CEC Chairman was prevented from entering Ajaria at Choloki checkpoint on the administrative border. On 16 April, at a press conference, the CEC Chairman declared that for security reasons elections in Khulo and Kobuleti would not be held on 18 April. Nevertheless, the elections were not officially cancelled. The CEC based its decision to annul the district-wide election results in Khulo and Kobuleti and repeat polling in these two districts, respectively on Articles 105 § 13 and 105 § 12 of the EC. Prior to election day, the EOM [the Election Observation Mission] attempted to clarify with the CEC Chairman whether the CEC had the authority to cancel the DEC results. During these discussions, he [the CEC Chairman] indicated that it was certainly a questionable issue. While EC Article 105 § 13 grants the CEC the right to examine the PEC documentation, recount ballots and sum up results based on PEC protocols, the EC does not specifically grant the CEC the authority to annul the results in an entire district. In fact, the CEC simply cancelled the entire district results without hearing testimony or investigating the circumstances at each PEC or establishing with any certainty if the number of votes at the annulled polling stations was sufficient to meet the criteria outlined in Article 105 § 12. Furthermore, the CEC did not examine the electoral material. Elsewhere, where results were annulled this was done by DECs or local courts. Notwithstanding the fact that violations took place in Khulo and Kobuleti districts, the decision to annul their results and call a repeat polling appeared inconsistent with the fact that major violations in other districts did not result in the annulling of the DEC results there. Moreover, the legal arguments used and legal basis were weak. The EOM believes that Article 105 § 12 relates to majoritarian elections rather than the proportional contest. The citing of this article rather than Article 105 § 16 (which specifically mentions its applicability to proportional elections) raises the question as to whether Georgia is a single electoral unit for the proportional election or seventy-five ‘fragments’. This issue is not adequately defined in the EC. ... Should Article 105 § 16 be applied, then elections should also be repeated elsewhere, as more than 10% of voters within a district were affected by the annulling of results. Thus, it appeared that the CEC adopted different and legally questionable procedures just for these two districts. [Election observers] appealed the CEC decision to invalidate the election results and to set repeat elections in Khulo and Kobuleti. In the course of the hearing it became apparent that CEC Order 82/2004 was based on a questionable decision-making procedure. The CEC could not prove that it made the decision to annul the district results on a PEC-by-PEC basis. The Tbilisi District Court upheld the CEC decision and challenged the election observers’ authority to bring the case. The court decided that their appeals were [in]admissible because their legitimate rights or interests were not damaged. [The observers] appealed this decision at the Supreme Court, that ruled against [them] in a closed session. The decision to dismiss the case, based on the plaintiffs not having the legal right to appeal, was highly questionable. The EC does not clearly state that observers can appeal a CEC decision to invalidate the DEC results since there is no provision in the EC that the CEC can overrule a DEC in such cases. Consequently, the decision of the CEC had to be questioned, not the rights of observers. The dismissal of such an important and well-founded case ... contributed to the impression that the [electoral] law was applied in a non-transparent and inconsistent manner.” 54. In one of its working documents, the French Senate examined the systems of voter registration in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom. 55. With the exception of Portugal and the United Kingdom, the initial registration of voters and subsequent amendments to the electoral rolls in these States are automatically carried out by the authorities on the basis of mandatory domiciliary declarations by the population. 56. In Portugal, the compilation and modification of electoral rolls depend on the voters’ individual requests to that end. Portuguese law even envisages individual criminal responsibility for those who fail to take the necessary steps for electoral registration. 57. In the United Kingdom, the system is mixed. The authorities compile electoral rolls automatically, on the basis of domiciliary declarations and the general census of the population. However, all subsequent modifications to the rolls are contingent upon voters’ individual declarations to that end. 60. The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) has identified three broad types or models of electoral management – the independent, governmental and mixed models (see Electoral Management Design: The International IDEA Handbook). The independent model of electoral management exists in those countries where elections are organised and managed by an electoral management body which is institutionally independent and autonomous from the executive branch of government, and which has, and manages, its own budget. It may be accountable to the legislature, the judiciary, or the Head of State, but not to the government. The governmental model exists in those countries where elections are organised and managed by the executive branch through a ministry (such as the Ministry of the Interior) and/or through local authorities. In the mixed model of electoral management, there are usually two component bodies, and dual structures exist: a policy, monitoring or supervisory body that is independent of the executive branch of government and an implementation body located within a Department of State and/or local government. 61. According to the classification system adopted by the IDEA, among the forty-seven member States of the Council of Europe there are twenty-two countries, mostly from central and eastern Europe, which follow the independent model. There are sixteen States which have adopted the governmental model, and nine the mixed model. Among the thirteen Contracting States considered in the IDEA handbook, four are classified as following the independent model (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Moldova and Serbia), six the governmental model (Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Sweden and the United Kingdom) and three the mixed model (Hungary, Portugal and Spain). 62. There are no common standards among Contracting States as regards the composition of electoral commissions and the appointment of their members. As regards the authority which is competent for formally appointing the commission members, there are some countries which provide for a unique institution (the parliament in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Hungary and Serbia; the Head of State in Bulgaria and the United Kingdom; and the government in Sweden). Even in these cases, however, other institutions and actors may intervene in the nomination process. For instance, in Bulgaria the members of the CEC are appointed after consultation with parliamentary parties and coalitions. In Hungary, the members of the National Election Committee are elected on the basis of a motion submitted by the Minister of the Interior, after taking the parties’ recommendations into account. In the United Kingdom, Her Majesty appoints the commission members on an address from the House of Commons, made after consultation with the leaders of registered parties. 63. There are other systems which provide for a mixed appointment by different State organs, including the judiciary. In Moldova, one member is appointed by the President, one by the government and seven by the Parliament. In Portugal, the National Election Commission is composed of a judge appointed by the judiciary, citizens designated by the Parliament and three specialists designated by governmental departments. The Spanish electoral boards have a quasi-judicial composition, since the majority of their members are directly appointed from among sitting judges by the General Council of the Judicial Power, whereas the rest are selected from among experts proposed by the political parties. 64. In systems which can be regarded as governmental from the standpoint of electoral management, such as Belgium or Germany, the majority of the assessors of the electoral boards/committees are appointed by the chairman (a judge in Belgium; the Federal Returning Officer nominated by the Ministry of the Interior in Germany) among electors. In Germany, most of the assessors are proposed by the political parties. In Italy, electoral boards responsible for the lawfulness of the electoral lists and candidates are created within the Court of Cassation and other tribunals. The difference with the countries mentioned above is that, in such countries, electoral bodies are set up for the exclusive purpose of specific elections. 65. In some States, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Hungary, Portugal, Spain and Sweden, the electoral commissions may be classified as expertbased. In others, such as Bulgaria, Moldova or Serbia, the commissions are composed of experts and representatives of political parties (combined membership). The electoral legislation in Hungary and Serbia provides for the possibility of expanded membership of the commissions to include representatives of political parties which have submitted electoral lists. 66. The general trend is that decisions are taken by a simple majority (Germany, Hungary, Moldova, Portugal, Serbia, Spain and Sweden). Only in Bosnia and Herzegovina (a two-thirds majority, except for municipal commissions), Bulgaria (a two-thirds majority) and the Czech Republic (an absolute majority), is a qualified majority required. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, if a decision cannot be reached at the first meeting, then at the second meeting the decision is taken by a majority vote. 67. In the case of a tie, the chairman has the casting vote in Germany, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. This helps to avoid eventual obstructions to the decision-making process. By contrast, in the Czech Republic, in the event of a tie, the proposal is deemed to be rejected. The fact that a chairman with the casting vote is directly appointed by the president of the Republic or the executive government, as in Georgia, is of course a relevant factor to be borne in mind for the assessment of the independence of an electoral agency. This can only be compared to the position of the Federal Returning Officer or the Land Returning Officer in the Federal Electoral Committee and the Land Electoral Committees in Germany, whose appointment depends on the Federal Ministry of the Interior or the Land Government. In both cases, the officer is the chairman of the committee and has a casting vote. By contrast, in the majority of the countries examined, the chairman is elected by the electoral commission itself (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Hungary, Moldova, Serbia and Spain). 68. One of the guarantees of election commissions’ independence is that persons who could be involved in an inherent conflict of interests should not be allowed to be appointed to electoral commissions, in particular registered candidates. This kind of rule can be found in the majority of the Contracting States considered (Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Moldova, Portugal, Serbia, Spain and the United Kingdom). Apart from candidates standing for election, incompatibility requirements may apply to members of political parties or organisations nominating candidates (Hungary and Moldova), members or employees of registered parties (the United Kingdom), members of parliament, judges in the Supreme Court, servicemen in the armed forces, officers in the Ministry of the Interior (Bulgaria), the president of the Republic, heads of administrative offices, civil servants, and mayors (Hungary). 69. In order to achieve an adequate balance between political representatives in the commission, there are some systems which provide specific rules. For instance, in Bulgaria and Serbia, no political party or coalition may have a majority within the commission. In Bulgaria, the chairman and the secretary must belong to different political parties. In the Czech Republic, the chairman and the vice-chairman of an electoral board may not be representatives of the same political party or coalition.",[],[],[],"['14', 'P1']",['P1-3'],[],0
45,001-89994,ENG,HRV,ADMISSIBILITY,2008,TRIFUNOVIC v. CROATIA,4,Inadmissible,Christos Rozakis;Dean Spielmann;George Nicolaou;Giorgio Malinverni;Khanlar Hajiyev;Sverre Erik Jebens,"The applicant, Mrs Milka Trifunović, is a national of Bosnia and Herzegovina who was born in 1941 and currently lives in Munich. She was represented before the Court by Mr Č. Prodanović, a lawyer practising in Zagreb. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs Š. Stažnik. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant’s husband, V.T., was an officer serving in the Yugoslav Peoples’ Army (“the YPA”). In 1984 the YPA awarded him, and he became the holder of, a specially protected tenancy (stanarsko pravo) of a flat in Zagreb. Pursuant to the relevant legislation, the applicant as his wife automatically became a co-holder of the specially protected tenancy of the flat in issue. After a trial in absentia, on 16 March 1993 the Varaždin County Court (Okružni sud u Varaždinu) found V.T. guilty of a war crime against the civilian population and sentenced him to fifteen years’ imprisonment. The judgment was upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court on 12 January 1994. The courts found that in the period between 15 and 22 September 1991, during the siege of the YPA’s military barracks in the town of Varaždin, V.T. as a commander of the 32nd (Varaždin) corps of the YPA had ordered indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets in the town. On 7 July 1994 the State brought a civil action against V.T. and the applicant in the Zagreb Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zagrebu) seeking termination of their specially protected tenancy and the applicant’s eviction. The plaintiff relied on section 102a of the Housing Act. On 9 June 2000 the Municipal Court ruled for the plaintiff. It terminated the tenancy of V.T. and his wife and ordered the applicant (the wife) to vacate the flat within fifteen days. In the reasons given for its decision the court referred to the State’s obligation stipulated in paragraph 2 of section 102a of the Housing Act (see below). V.T. and his wife appealed. On 28 May 2002 the Zagreb County Court (Županijski sud u Zagrebu) dismissed the appeal and upheld the first-instance judgment. On 2 August 2002 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the second-instance judgment alleging violations of her constitutional right to equality before the law, the right to be presumed innocent and the right to respect and protection of personal and family life, dignity, reputation and honour. On 25 January 2006 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint. It held that the lower courts’ judgments were not a result of the arbitrary interpretation or application of relevant substantive law and that therefore her constitutional right to equality before the courts had not been breached. Moreover, since the outcome of the proceedings the applicant had complained about did not involve the determination of her criminal liability, her right to be presumed innocent could not have possibly been breached in such proceedings. On 19 June 1991 the Specially Protected Tenancies (Sale to Occupier) Act entered into force. It entitled holders of specially protected tenancies of flats in social ownership (društveno vlasništvo) to purchase their flats under favourable conditions. On 17 August 1995 the Amendments to the Act entered into force extending the right of purchase to holders of specially protected tenancies of flats in state ownership (državno vlasništvo). The applicant never filed a request with the competent authorities with a view to purchasing her flat because she considered that she could not have done so while the proceedings for termination of her specially protected tenancy were pending. The Housing Act (Zakon o stambenim odnosima, Official Gazette nos. 51/1985, 42/1986, 22/1992 and 70/1993), as in force at the material time, provided as follows: Section 64 “2. If a specially protected tenancy was acquired by one spouse who lives with the other, the other shall also be considered as having acquired it.. 3. If one of the spouses dies or permanently ceases to use the flat, the other spouse shall retain the tenancy, unless otherwise provided for by this Act.” Section 102a “1. A specially protected tenancy of those who participated or participate in enemy activities against the Republic of Croatia shall be terminated. 2. Following the court decision on the termination, the owner of the flat shall provide either the same flat or other appropriate lodging for use by the [other] members of the household.” Section 105 “1. The provider of the flat shall terminate a specially protected tenancy by bringing an action in the competent court. 2.... 3. The judgment ordering eviction shall not be enforced if the person to be evicted is not provided with another flat or basic accommodation [nužni smještaj], when that is required by this Act. 4. Another flat shall be secured by the provider of the flat at the latest by the end of the main hearing in the proceedings for the termination of the specially protected tenancy, unless otherwise provided for by this Act.” 5. Basic accommodation shall be secured in enforcement proceedings.” Section 108 “The duty of the tenant to vacate the flat extends to other users of that flat, unless otherwise provided for by this Act.” According to the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence, the specially protected tenancy was terminated as soon as the court’s judgment, upholding the claim of the provider of the flat to that end, became res judicata (see, inter alia, the Supreme Court’s decision no. Rev-1009/1993-2 of 15 June 1994). In its decisions nos. Gzz-11/1996-2 of 27 November 1996, Rev-211/1996-2 of 28 January 1997, Rev-935/1995-2 of 23 September 1997, Gzz-7/1996-2 and Gzz-35/1996-2 of 7 September 1999 the Supreme Court held that where a spouse acquired a specially protected tenancy on the basis of section 64 of the Housing Act, his or her right was to be considered derived from that of the other spouse to whom the flat had originally been awarded (that is, the original holder of the tenancy). Consequently, when the specially protected tenancy of the original holder was terminated, the tenancy of the other spouse derived from it was to be considered terminated as well. In its opinion no. Su-IV-482/2002 of 17 May 2002 and decisions nos. Rev-431/1998-2 and Gzz-46/01- 2 of 10 January 2002, Gzz-33/00-2 of 19 November 2002, Gzz-36/1999-2 of 26 March 2003, Gzz-81/2003-2 of 7 May 2003 and Gzz-35/2000 of 6 October 2004 the Supreme Court held that in a judgment terminating the specially protected tenancy of the original holder, and consequently that of the spouse, on the basis of section 102a (1) of the Housing Act, a court was entitled to order the eviction of the original holder but not of the spouse whose tenancy was derived from it. This was so because the spouse was entitled to remain in the flat in the capacity of a household member, pursuant to section 102a (2) of the Housing Act, until the provider of the flat either gave him or her the same flat for use or provided him or her with other appropriate lodging. Only in circumstances where the requisite alternative accommodation was secured for the spouse and other household members, but they nevertheless continued to occupy the flat, was the provider of the flat entitled to bring a separate civil action for their eviction. However, in the above mentioned decision no. Gzz-36/1999-2 of 26 March 2003 the Supreme Court upheld a judgment in which, apart from terminating the specially protected tenancy of both spouses under section 102a (1) of the Housing Act, the lower court also ordered their eviction but made that order in respect of the wife – a household member – conditional upon providing her with alternative accommodation. The Supreme Court upheld the judgment because, as it was formulated, it was not detrimental for the wife as the household member. In its decisions nos. U-I-116/1992 of 24 June 1992, U-III-326/1995 of 24 February 1999, U-III-435/2000 of 17 May 2000 and U-III-457/2000 of 13 December 2000 the Constitutional Court held that section 102a of the Housing Act did not introduce the principle of collective guilt because its paragraph 2 obliged the State to provide for the household members by meeting their housing needs. Nor did it violate the constitutional right to be presumed innocent because, properly interpreted, that provision could only be applied to those holders of specially protected tenancies who had been convicted by a final judgment delivered in criminal proceedings. The Specially Protected Tenancies (Sale to Occupier) Act (Zakon o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo, Official Gazette no. 27/1991 with subsequent amendments – “the Sale to Occupier Act”), which entered into force on 19 June 1991, entitled the holder of a specially protected tenancy (“the tenant”) of a socially-owned flat to purchase it from the provider of the flat under favourable conditions. The members of the tenant’s household were also entitled to do so upon his or her approval (section 6 paragraph 1). Where both spouses were holders of the specially protected tenancy of a flat, they could buy it either jointly or individually with the consent of the other (section 6 paragraph 2). Section 4 (2) provided that a written request for purchase (the first request) had to be made within one year of the date of the Act’s entry into force (this time-limit was by subsequent amendments to the Act extended until 31 December 1995), and a further request for the actual conclusion of the purchase contract (the second request) within the two years following the first request. In its decision no. Rev-944/99-2 of 13 August 2002 the Supreme Court interpreted section 4 (2) of the Specially Protected Tenancies (Sale to Occupier) Act as follows: “Since the plaintiff did not make a request for purchase of the flat to the respondents in written form until 31 December 1995, as provided by law, [...], the lower-instance courts correctly assessed that the plaintiff had lost his right to request the conclusion of the purchase contract.” The Amendments to the Sale to Occupier Act (Zakon o izmjenama i dopunama Zakona o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo, Official Gazette no. 58/1995 – “the 1995 Amendments”), which entered into force on 17 August 1995, extended the right of purchase to the holders of specially protected tenancies of state-owned flats. Section 16 read as follows: (1) Holders of specially protected tenancies [...] shall have the right to purchase their flats in state ownership. (2) The provisions of section 6 of [the Sale to Occupier Act] shall not apply to the purchase of flats in state ownership. (3) The following persons shall not be entitled to purchase, or transfer the right to purchase, a flat in state ownership: - those sentenced by a final judgment for crimes against humanity and international law, - those sentenced by a final judgment for crimes against the Republic of Croatia, - those against whom criminal proceedings for crimes against humanity and international law or crimes against the Republic of Croatia have been instituted, until the judgment becomes final, - those who participated or participate in enemy activities against the Republic of Croatia, - those who have evaded conscription, - those against whom proceedings for termination of a specially protected tenancy or termination of a lease agreement in respect of a flat have been instituted, until the end of those proceedings, - those owning a dwelling house or flat in the same place [village, town or city], - those who have left the Republic of Croatia or have moved to the occupied territories and have not used the flat for more than six months. Section 20 (1 and 2) of the 1995 Amendments provided that a written request to purchase a state-owned flat (the first request) had to be made within sixty days of the date of the 1995 Amendments’ entry into force (paragraph 1), after the expiry of which the tenant lost his or her right to purchase the flat (paragraph 2). Section 20 (3) provided that the seller had to conclude the purchase contract with the buyer within one year after the expiry of the time-limit referred to in paragraph 1 (this time-limit was by subsequent amendments extended until 31 December 1998). Section 20 (4) provided that if the seller, at the request of the buyer, failed to conclude the contract within the time-limit referred in paragraph 3, the buyer had a right to bring a civil action in the competent court with a view to obtaining a judgment entirely substituting the contract. Following 37 petitions to review the constitutionality of the 1995 Amendments, on 26 June 1996 the Constitutional Court accepted the initiative and instituted proceedings to that end. On 29 January 1997 it delivered decision no. U-I-697/1995 abrogating a number of provisions of the 1995 Amendments as being unconstitutional. In particular, the Constitutional Court abrogated paragraphs 1 and 2 of sections 16 and 20. It further abrogated paragraph 3 of section 16 in the part relating to the transfer of the right to purchase but held that this abrogation did not relate to sub-paragraphs 6 and 7. Sub-paragraphs 4, 5 and 8 of paragraph 3 of the same section were also abrogated. It observed that paragraph 2 of section 16, as it read, in fact entitled only the holder of the specially protected tenancy of a state-owned flat to purchase it, thereby effectively excluding the spouse and other members of the household from doing so, an option otherwise available to them under section 6 of the Sale to Occupier Act in respect of socially-owned flats. The Constitutional Court held that the exclusion of that option in respect of state-owned flats was unwarranted and thus amounted to constitutionally impermissible discrimination. In particular, the Constitutional Court held that this discrimination adversely affected, inter alia, a spouse who had acquired a specially protected tenancy by operation of section 64 of the Housing Act but whose tenancy was subsequently terminated as a consequence of the termination of the tenancy of the original holder pursuant to section 102a (1) of that Act. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of section 20 were also abrogated because of an unwarranted distinction as regards the time-limits for making a request to purchase the flat between the holders of specially protected tenancies of state-owned flats and those of socially-owned flats. The Constitutional Court noted that the holders of specially protected tenancies of state-owned flats had been obliged to make their request within only sixty days following the entry into force of the 1995 Amendments whereas the holders of tenancies of socially-owned flats had had to do so within one year following the entry into force of the Sale to Occupier Act, which time-limit had been extended several times (eventually until 31 December 1995). In its decision no. Rev-1256/02-2 of 14 July 2004 the Supreme Court interpreted the relationship between the Sale to Occupier Act (in particular its section 4) and the 1995 Amendments as follows: “The plaintiff made a request for purchase of the flat to the respondent on 18 October 1996, that is, after the expiry of the prescribed time-limit (31 December 1995), so the courts [ruled] correctly [when they] dismissed her claim. The time-limit in question is preclusive, meaning that after its expiry a holder of a specially protected tenancy loses his or her right to make a request to purchase the flat ... The fact that the proceedings for termination of the specially protected tenancy – that ended by the first-instance judgment [...] of 16 April 1996, which became final on 11 July 1996 – were pending between the parties at the time when the time-limit expired (31 December 1995) is not relevant. [...][Those proceedings] did not prevent the plaintiff from making a request to purchase the flat. ... The provisions of section 16 of the 1995 Amendments on which the plaintiff relies, and which concern the so-called state-owned flats, did not extend the time-limit for making the request to purchase the flat. Under [section 16 of the 1995 Amendments] the persons, against whom the proceedings for termination of the specially protected tenancy ... have been instituted, could not, until the end of those proceedings, buy a state-owned flat. That means, in particular, that the plaintiff could not have concluded a contract of sale in respect of the flat until 11 July 1996, when the proceedings for the termination of the specially protected tenancy ended ... On that day that impediment ceased to exist ... [H]owever making a written request to purchase the flat before the expiry of the prescribed time-limit is a precondition for the conclusion of the contract [of sale]. Since the plaintiff had not made such a request before the time-limit had expired (31 December 1995) she had lost the right to make the request and the respondent was not obliged to sell her the flat on the basis of the request made after the expiry of the time-limit (18 October 1996). The proceedings for termination of the specially protected tenancy were an impediment to buying the flat (for the conclusion of a contract), but not to making a request to purchase the flat. The existence of the [pending] proceedings does not extend the time-limit for making a request to purchase the flat. The Constitutional Court’s decision U-I-697/1995 of 29 January 1997 abrogating, inter alia, section 20 paragraphs 1 and 2 of the 1995 Amendments is of no relevance to the outcome of these proceedings. Those abrogated provisions provided that the request ... to purchase the state-owned flat had to be made within sixty days following the entry into force of the 1995 Amendments and that after the expiry of that time-limit the applicant lost the right to buy the flat. [Those provisions] placed the holders of specially protected tenancies of state-owned flats in an unequal position compared to the holders of such tenancies of flats not owned by the State, because for them the considerably shorter preclusive time-limit for making their request to purchase the flat was prescribed (the prescribed time-limit of sixty days expired on 16 October 1995). By the Constitutional Court’s decision the buyers of state-owned flats were put in the same position as other buyers, but they were not given a privileged status so that the prescribed time-limit for making a request to purchase the flat (31 December 1995), valid for all other buyers, would not apply to them.” The Lease of Flats Act (Zakon o najmu stanova, Official Gazette no. 91/1996 of 28 October 1996), which entered into force on 5 November 1996, abolished the specially protected tenancy as such (section 30 paragraph 1) but provided that proceedings instituted under the Housing Act should be concluded under the provisions of that Act (section 8 paragraph 1). The Lease of Flats Act regulates the legal relationship between landlord and tenant with respect to the lease of flats. It recognises a special category of tenants, namely those who were previously holders of specially protected tenancies of privately-owned flats or those who did not purchase their flats under the Sale to Occupier Act. That category is subject to a number of protections, for instance, an obligation on the owners that a contractual lease should last for an unlimited period of time; payment of a protected rent (zaštićena najamnina), the amount of which is to be prescribed by the Government, as well as limited reasons for the termination of the lease. Section 37 provides that if none of the persons living in the flat held the specially protected tenancy at the moment of the Act’s entry into force (for example, the household members) they could institute proceedings before the competent court to obtain the status of lessees under a lease agreement with protected rent. On 3 October 1991 the Government adopted a decree (Uredba o preuzimanju sredstava JNA i SSNO na teritoriju Republike Hrvatske u vlasništvo Republike Hrvatske) whereby it took all the YPA’s property in Croatia into state ownership.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
46,001-72819,ENG,POL,ADMISSIBILITY,2006,STENZEL v. POLAND,4,Inadmissible,Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant, Mr Krzysztof Stenzel, is an Polish national who was born in 1964 and lives in Rumia, Poland. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. In 1990 the applicant married J.S. In 1991 their daughter P. was born. On an unspecified date in 1992 the applicant moved out of the family home. On 4 June 1992 the applicant applied to the Gdynia District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) for a residence order in respect of P.. Consequently, access proceedings were instituted. In June 1992 the applicant filed a petition for divorce with the Gdynia District Court. On 13 July 1992 the applicant requested the Gdynia District Court to make an interim order on access arrangements during the custody and access proceedings. On 27 July 1992 he also requested that J.S. be divested of parental rights. On 10 August 1992 the applicant was awarded interim access to the child by the Gdynia District Court. This allowed him to visit the child on Saturdays. J.S. refused to comply with that order. On 3 September 1992 the applicant applied for a court order prohibiting his wife from removing the child from Poland without his consent. On 4 November 1992 the court refused his request. On 30 December 1992 he requested the Gdynia District Court to change the access arrangements determined on 10 August 1992. On 8 June 1993 the Gdańsk Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) dissolved the applicant’s marriage. The court awarded parental rights to both parents. It also limited the applicant in the exercise of his rights: it ordered that P.’s permanent residence be with her mother, but allowed the applicant to co-decide about the child’s education and health. The court did not specify access arrangements. On 10 December 1993 the applicant appealed against the divorce. On 9 December 1993 J.S. instituted proceedings in which she requested that the applicant be divested of his parental rights on the ground that he had been aggressive towards her. On 14 December 1993 the custody and access case was joined with the case instituted by the applicant’s wife. In January 1994 J.S. left Poland together with the child and settled in Germany. She did not inform the applicant about it and did not give their new address in Germany. In February 1994 the court gave J.S. three months in which to ensure compliance with the access arrangements provided for by the order of 10 August 1992. In February and in April 1994 the applicant again amended his application concerning the access arrangements and requested that the court issue a new interim decision to replace that of August 1992. On 5 April 1994 the Gdynia District Court issued a decision allowing the applicant to see P. every Tuesday for two hours at the Family Diagnostics Centre in Sopot in her mother’s presence. The mother appealed. On 6 September 1994 the Gdańsk Regional Court quashed this decision and remitted the case. In October 1994 J.S. married a German citizen, changed her name to J.V. and moved to Hamburg with P.. She did not inform the applicant of her whereabouts. The applicant subsequently established their address with the assistance of the Polish consulate in Hamburg. On 1 November 1994 the mother submitted that she would agree to report with the child at the Family Diagnostics Centre for an interview if she was granted appropriate protection against the applicant’s aggressive behaviour. Following the remittal, on 19 October 1995 the Gdynia District Court issued its decision. The court dismissed J.V.’s motion that the applicant be divested of his parental rights, and the applicant’s motion that the child reside permanently with him. The court found that J.V was living with her new husband, a German citizen, his parents and P. in a house with a garden. It had been established by German social assistance authorities that P. got on well with her new environment and called her stepfather “dad”. P was happy, healthy and well cared for in her mother’s house. In April 1995 J.V. gave birth to another child. Conversely, the applicant was unemployed, lost his right to social security assistance and lived in his parent’s house. He had been also paying maintenance for another child – a six-year old son. The court considered that P. had every chance of obtaining an upbringing in a functional restructured family composed of her mother, her step-father and half-sister. She had a sense of security and stability in her mother’s house and it had been in the child’s interest to stay there. The court did not find any reasons to divest J.V of her parental rights. The fact that she had left Poland without informing the applicant thereof had certainly been an abuse of her parental rights, but could not serve as a ground on which to divest her of her rights in respect of P.’s custody. As to the applicant, there were also no grounds on which to divest him of his parental rights. The applicant lodged an appeal with the Gdańsk Regional Court. He submitted that since 1992 the mother had made it impossible for him to have any contacts with P. On 11 April 1996 the Gdańsk Regional Court upheld this decision. The court repeated the arguments of the first-instance court. On 15 April 1996 the applicant instituted new proceedings in which he again requested the Gdynia District Court to establish access arrangements. On 23 April 1996 he lodged a further motion asking that full custody rights be restored to him. On 20 May 1997 the Gdynia District Court dismissed the applicant’s motion of 23 April 1996 and refused to award custody to him. The court found, on the basis of new evidence obtained meanwhile from the German authorities, that P. was well integrated in her new family in Hamburg. She had no distinct memory of her life with her father before the divorce. Moreover, she received affection from her mother, her mother’s husband and his family. The spouses cared well for her, providing P. with the best conditions for her upbringing. The court accepted J.V.’s testimony that she had not deprived the applicant of effective access to the child as it had been the applicant who had made the contacts difficult due to his aggressive behaviour. The court concluded that removing P. from her mother’s custody, or even establishing a permanent access arrangement with the applicant, would harm the health and development of the child. On 19 June 1997 the applicant appealed against this decision. On 16 September 1997 the Gdańsk Regional Court upheld the contested decision and dismissed his appeal. It noted that having regard to the child’s well-being there were no circumstances which would justify a new decision on access arrangements. On 10 April 1998 the Ombudsman lodged a motion on the applicant’s behalf with the Gdynia District Court to determine access arrangements. It was argued that the question of the applicant’s access to P. had never been settled except for the interim order of 10 August 1992. The child’s mother had deprived the applicant and the child of any possibility of contact. The applicant was right in emphasising that J.V. had abused her parental rights by removing the child from Poland without the applicant’s or the court’s permission or knowledge. That had constituted a violation of the domestic regulations and relevant provisions of international law. The Ombudsman stressed that J.V.’s actions had been clearly unlawful. On 18 December 1998 the Gdynia District Court dismissed the applicant’s request for an interim access decision allowing him to send letters and presents to P. On 18 March 1999 the Gdynia District Court established a temporary access arrangement and allowed the applicant to call P. once a week and to send letters to her. The applicant’s further appeal against this access arrangement was dismissed by the decision of the Gdańsk Regional Court on 28 May 1999. On 6 July 2001 the Gdańsk District Court gave a decision on access arrangements. The child would visit the applicant once a year and he would be allowed to spend 14 days with her during the summer holidays. In addition the child would twice a month call the applicant. The applicant was allowed to send letters to his daughter. The child’s mother appealed against this decision On 14 June 2002 the Gdańsk Regional Court amended the first instance decision. The court considered that there were no grounds on which to accept that the child should have direct contacts with the applicant. P. had been brought up without any contacts with her father and she did not know him. Furthermore, as it appeared from her statements given in the proceedings before the German authorities, she had not been interested in having contact with the applicant. The court held that establishing a permanent access arrangement with the applicant could harm the child’s health and her development. In conclusion, the court allowed the applicant to send letters and gifts to his daughter. On 12 December 1994 and 26 January 1996 the Gdynia District Court imposed fines on J.V. in the amount of 10 PLN for failure to comply with its order of 10 August 1992. On an unknown later date J.V. paid the fine which had been imposed on her on 12 December 1994. The enforcement proceedings concerning the second fine were discontinued in July 1997. On 10 November 1999 the applicant again requested the court to impose a fine on J.V, alleging that she had prevented him from talking to P. on the phone and that she had refused to accept letters he had sent to P. On 16 November 2000 the Gdynia District Court dismissed his request. The court considered that the applicant had failed to contact the mother in order to obtain her telephone number, and that it was not established that the mother had sent back any applicant’s letters. On 27 March 2001, the Gdańsk Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the first-instance decision. The court considered that it had not been confirmed that J.V. had obstructed the applicant’s attempts to contact his daughter. On 20 January 2000 the Reinbeck District Court in Germany decided to change the divorce judgment insofar as it concerned the custody of P. and granted custody solely to the mother. It considered that the parents were in conflict and that, in any event, the applicant and the child lived far away from each other. The applicant had failed to appeal against this decision. The Family and Custody Code (Kodeks Rodzinny i Opiekuńczy) provides: Article 58 § 1 “In a decision on divorce, the court is competent to issue orders as to the care of the parties’ minor children (...). The court may grant custody right to one parent and limit the custody rights of the other one.” The Code of Civil Proceedings (Kodeks Postępowania Cywilnego) provides: Article 557 “The custody court can change its decision if the best interest of the person whom it concerns so require. “ According to the Supreme Court’s resolution, if a parent who has been obliged by a court decision to respect the other parents’ access rights refuses to comply therewith, access decisions are liable to the enforcement proceedings. The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure on enforcement of non-pecuniary obligations are applicable to enforcement of court decisions on parental rights or access rights (resolution of the Supreme Court of 30 January 1976, III CZP 94/75, OSNCP 1976 7-8): Article 1050 “1. If the debtor is obliged to take measures which cannot be taken by any other person, the court in whose district the enforcement proceedings were instituted, on the motion of a creditor and after hearing the parties, shall fix the time-limit within which the debtor shall comply with his obligation, on pain of a fine (...). 2. If the debtor fails to comply with this obligation, further time-limits may be fixed and further fines may be imposed by the court.” If the court obliges a parent exercising custody rights to ensure access to a child to the other parent, Article 1050 of the Code of Civil Proceedings is applicable to the enforcement of this obligation. The Hague Convention on Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction of 1980 provides in so far as relevant. Article 21 “An application to make arrangements for organizing or securing the effective exercise of rights of access may be presented to the Central Authorities of the Contracting States in the same way as an application for the return of a child. The Central Authorities are bound by the obligations of co-operation which are set forth in Article 7 to promote the peaceful enjoyment of access rights and the fulfilment of any conditions to which the exercise of such rights may be subject. The central Authorities shall take steps to remove, as far as possible, all obstacles to the exercise of such rights. The Central Authorities, either directly or through intermediaries, may initiate or assist in the institution of proceedings with a view to organizing or protecting these rights and securing respect for the conditions to which the exercise of these rights may be subject.”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
47,001-96087,ENG,SRB,CHAMBER,2009,CASE OF MOLNAR GABOR v. SERBIA,3,Preliminary objection joined to merits (ratione temporis);Preliminary objection dismissed (non-exhaustion of domestic remedies);No violation of Art. 6-1;No violation of P1-1,Françoise Tulkens;Ireneu Cabral Barreto;Nona Tsotsoria;Vladimiro Zagrebelsky,"6. Following the financial crisis in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as well as the collapse of the banking system in Serbia in the 1990s, in 1998 and 2002 the respondent State adopted specific legislation accepting the conversion of foreign currency deposits in certain banks, including Vojvođanska banka, into a public debt. The legislation set the time-frame (2016) and the amounts, including interest, to be paid back to the banks' former clients. It also explicitly provided, inter alia, that any foreign currency-related judicial proceedings were to be discontinued (for details concerning the relevant domestic law see paragraphs 20-27 below). 7. The applicant was born in 1926 and lives in Subotica, Serbia. He is retired and receives a pension in the net amount of approximately 250 Euros (“EUR”) monthly. 8. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 9. On a number of separate occasions, the applicant deposited a certain amount of his foreign currency savings with the Subotica branch of Vojvođanska banka, a bank based in Novi Sad. 10. In 1991 the said bank refused to release the applicant's funds. 11. On 21 July 1993 the applicant filed a civil claim, seeking the release of his foreign currency deposits with the interest stipulated. 12. On 27 September 1993 the Municipal Court in Subotica ruled partly in favour of the applicant and ordered the bank to pay him: (i) 15,584.41 German Marks (“DEM”), on account of his foreign currency savings; (ii) 37,460,000,000 Yugoslav Dinars (“YUD”), for his legal costs; and (iii) the statutory interest due in respect of the latter as of 27 September 1993. 13. On 20 March 1996 the District Court in Subotica upheld this judgment, adding that the respondent bank should also pay interest on the sum of DEM 15,584.41 which had been awarded. In particular, this interest was to be paid as of 1 January 1993, based on the DEM sight deposit rate (kamata na štedne uloge po viđenju). 14. On 2 October 1996 the Supreme Court rejected the respondent's appeal on points of law (revizija) and confirmed the District Court's judgment. 15. On 24 April 2001 and 26 September 2001, respectively, the applicant filed two separate requests with the Municipal Court in Subotica, seeking enforcement of the above judgment by means of a bank account transfer. 16. On 2 April 2002 the Municipal Court rejected those requests, stating that, under the relevant domestic legislation, all judicial enforcement proceedings aimed at the collection of foreign currency deposits had to be discontinued. 17. On 30 March 2004 the bank confirmed that the applicant's foreign currency savings had been converted into a public debt in the amount of EUR 8,740.18. 18. As of 1 March 2007 the applicant was still owed EUR 6,652, having in the meantime, in several instalments and on various grounds, been reimbursed a total of EUR 2,088.18. 19. There is no information in the case file whether the applicant received any payments thereafter. 20. Articles 1, 2, 3 and 4 provided that all foreign currency savings deposited with “authorised banks” before 18 March 1995, including explicitly the deposits held by the bank at issue in the present case, were to become a public debt. 21. Under Article 10, the State's responsibility in that respect was to be fully honoured by 2012 through the payment of specified amounts, plus interest, and according to a certain time-frame. 22. Article 22 provided that, as of the date of this Act's entry into force (12 December 1998), “all pending lawsuits, including judicial enforcement proceedings, aimed at the collection of the foreign currency covered by this Act shall be discontinued.” 23. This Act repeals the Act described above. In so doing, however, it explicitly acknowledges as part of the public debt all deposits previously recognised as such (in the total amount of EUR 4.2 billion as of 31 March 2002). It modifies the time-frame for honouring the debt in question (from 2012 to 2016) and specifies amended amounts, plus interest, to be paid annually. 24. Pursuant to Article 13, the banks' clients can make use of their deposits converted into Government bonds in order to pay taxes or indeed, under Articles 12 and 14, in advance of the said time-frame, for a number of purposes such as buying State property, taking part in the privatisation of State-owned businesses and banks, as well as, under certain conditions and up to a specified amount, the payment of medical treatment, medication and funeral costs. 25. In accordance with Articles 10 and 11, former clients of the banks in question may sell the said bonds on the stock exchange or to other banks or individuals. Such trading is exempt from all taxation. 26. Article 36 reaffirms that “all lawsuits aimed at the collection of the foreign currency savings covered by this Act, including the judicial enforcement proceedings, shall be discontinued.” 27. This Act has been in force since 4 July 2002. It was subsequently amended on two occasions, but these amendments concerned peripheral issues unrelated to the savers above-described status. 28. Articles 199 and 200 provide, inter alia, that anyone who has suffered fear, physical pain or mental anguish as a consequence of a breach of “personal rights” (prava ličnosti) may, depending on its duration and intensity, sue for financial compensation before the civil courts and, in addition, request other forms of redress “which may be capable” of affording adequate non-pecuniary satisfaction. 29. Article 379 § 1 provides, inter alia, that all claims recognised by a final court decision shall become time-barred within ten years, including those claims which would otherwise have become time-barred within a shorter period of time. 30. Article 360 § 3 provides that courts shall not take into account whether a given claim is time-barred unless and until there is a specific objection by the debtor to this effect. 31. Article 1 provides that statutory interest shall be paid as of the date of maturity of a recognised monetary claim in YUD until the date of its settlement (which includes awards granted by final court judgments). 32. Article 2 states that such interest shall be calculated on the basis of the official retail price index (mesečna stopa rasta cena na malo) plus another 0.5% monthly (mesečna fiksna stopa).",[],[],[],['6'],['6-1'],[],0
48,001-68291,ENG,TUR,ADMISSIBILITY,2005,F.A. v. TURKEY,4,Inadmissible,,"The applicant, who was born in 1971, is a Turkish national and lives in Diyarbakır. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 23 and 24 June 1996 the HADEP (Halkın Demokrasi Partisi – People's Democracy Party) held its annual congress in Ankara. The applicant participated in the congress as a delegate from Diyarbakır. During the congress, he was elected secretary of the board. While some of the delegates were reading their reports, a group of masked persons entered the congress building and chanted slogans in support of the PKK. They subsequently pulled down the Turkish flag and hung up a PKK banner and posters of Abdullah Öcalan. On 24 June 1996, on the instructions of the Ankara State Security Court Chief Public Prosecutor, police officers surrounded the congress building. When the congress was over, the police arrested the applicant as he was leaving the building. The police also arrested the executive board members of HADEP, the chairman and deputy chairman of the congress, as well as those involved in the pro-PKK actions. The applicant was taken to the anti-terror branch of the Ankara Security Directorate, where he was allegedly kept in a cell with four other persons and subjected to verbal abuse. On 4 July 1996 the applicant was brought before the Ankara State Security Court and subsequently placed in detention on remand. On 23 August 1996 the public prosecutor at the Ankara State Security Court filed an indictment with the court. He accused the applicant of being a member of an illegal organisation, namely the PKK. He referred to the events that had taken place during the HADEP congress. The prosecutor considered that as the applicant had been acting as secretary of the board during the congress, he could have stopped the masked persons from pulling down the Turkish flag and from displaying the PKK banner and posters of Abdullah Öcalan. The prosecutor called for the applicant to be sentenced pursuant to Article 168 § 2 of the Criminal Code for aiding and abetting a terrorist organisation. On 23 October 1996 the applicant was released pending trial. During the trial, the applicant maintained that he was not a member of the group which had pulled down the Turkish flag. He denied any responsibility for the impugned acts and requested to be acquitted. On 4 June 1997 the Ankara State Security Court delivered its decision. In the first place, the court found it necessary to distinguish the case from a simple case of insult to the Turkish flag. It took into consideration the statement of one of the accused persons who had pulled down the flag during the congress. In his statement, this accused person had explained that he had been acting on the instructions of HADEP officials. He stated that several university students had been brought to Ankara by bus to participate in the congress and had been instructed to shout slogans in support of the PKK and to hang posters of Öcalan and PKK banners on the walls. The court further noted that this was the first time that such a big Turkish flag had been hung in a congress building. According to the court, this act was planned by the HADEP officials in order to provoke a reaction. The court further examined video footage taken during the congress and concluded that the applicant, who was acting as secretary of the board during the congress, could have stopped the masked individuals from carrying out their acts. The court stated, inter alia, “...All the accused persons are competent and responsible persons in the HADEP. They had therefore the possibility of interrupting or even suspending the congress. By doing so, they could have helped the police force to capture the PKK militants who had taken down the Turkish flag and put up posters of Abdullah Öcalan instead... On the contrary the accused persons hid the PKK militants by forming groups and they assisted them in performing their activities...” In delivering its decision, the State Security Court further referred to sections 2 and 3 of the United Kingdom Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989, which concerned the membership of, support for and meetings of proscribed organisations and display of support to such organisations in public. The State Security Court convicted the applicant of aiding and abetting the members of a proscribed organisation and sentenced him to four years and six months' imprisonment pursuant to Article 169 of the Criminal Code and Article 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713 of 12 April 1991). The applicant appealed. The Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the Ankara State Security Court on the ground that the case file lacked relevant information and documents. The case was sent back to the Ankara State Security Court. While the proceedings were pending before the Ankara State Security Court, on 21 December 2000 new legislation (Law No. 4616), which governed the conditional release, suspension of proceedings or execution of sentences in respect of offences committed before 23 April 1999, came into force. The court accordingly suspended the proceedings against the applicant. According to Law No. 4616, these proceedings would be resumed only if the applicant were to commit an offence of the same or more serious kind within five years of the court's decision to suspend the proceedings. Pursuant to Article 4 of Law No. 4758, it was open to the applicant to request the Ankara State Security Court to continue the proceedings against him. However, he did not make such a request.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
49,001-61623,ENG,FRA,CHAMBER,2004,CASE OF D.P. v. FRANCE,1,No violation of Art. 6-1,,"8. The applicant was born in 1951 and is currently detained in Eysses Prison, Villeneuve-sur-Lot. 9. He was held in police custody from 25 to 27 September 1994, on suspicion of having sexually assaulted his stepdaughters. He made a full confession and, at the end of the period in police custody, he was charged with rape and aggravated sexual assault. He was detained on remand. 10. On 21 April 1995, under questioning by the investigating judge, the applicant retracted his confession; on 5 May 1995 he denied all the accusations made against him. He said that he had taken valium while in police custody and claimed that this drug could have impaired his mental faculties. 11. On 7 September 1995 the investigating judge extended the detention order. By an order of 22 December 1995, he rejected an application by the applicant for release. In a judgment of 9 January 1996, the Indictment Division of the Bordeaux Court of Appeal upheld the order. On 30 April 1996 the Court of Cassation dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant. The Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation which ruled in that judgment was composed of Mr Le Gunehec, President, a reporting judge and six other judges, including Mr Guilloux and Mr Le Gall. 12. On 9 February 1996 the parties were informed that the investigation was complete. By a judgment of 2 July 1996 the Indictment Division committed the applicant to stand trial at the Gironde Assize Court. 13. The applicant appealed on points of law and put forward two grounds in support of his appeal: the first alleged that the Indictment Division had failed to comply with the procedural rules necessary for the effective exercise of the rights of the defence, as set out in Article 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, concerning the parties' access to the case file before the hearing; the second concerned a lack of sufficient reasoning in the order committing him for trial, and noted that it did not set out the facts on which the charges were based or explain why the alleged offences were classified as they were. 14. The Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation delivered a judgment dismissing the appeal on 12 February 1997. The Division which ruled on the appeal was composed of Mr Guilloux, acting as president in the absence of the incumbent president who was unable to attend, Mr Le Gall as reporting judge, and six other judges. 15. In a judgment of 3 April 1998, the Gironde Assize Court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to nineteen years' imprisonment and suspended his civic, civil and family rights for ten years. 16. On that same date the applicant lodged an appeal with the Court of Cassation, in which he raised six points of law. The first alleged a violation of Article 362 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, on the ground that the Assize Court had not stated by what majority of votes the sentence had been imposed; the second concerned a failure to comply with the principle that hearings must be oral and, in particular, with Article 347 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which in principle prevented the court proper and the jury from deliberating with the case file before them; in his third point, the applicant complained of a violation of Article 379 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which prohibited the content of statements being mentioned in the official record, unless the presiding judge decided otherwise; the fourth and fifth points concerned the wording of the questions put to the jury; the final point alleged a breach of the rights of the defence, on the ground that the accused had not spoken last on the question of the withdrawal of parental responsibility. 17. The applicant was provisionally granted legal aid but, in a decision of 8 April 1999, the Legal Aid Office refused his request on the ground that “no arguable ground” of appeal on points of law could be made out against the judgment of 3 April 1998. 18. In a judgment of 9 June 1999, the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant's appeal on points of law. The Division was composed of Mr Gomez, President, Mr Guilloux, reporting judge, and Mr Le Gall, judge. 19. On 7 July 1999 the President of the Court of Cassation dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant against the Legal Aid Office's decision. 20. The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure applicable at the material time are the following: “Where appropriate, after delivering the judgment the president [of the assize court] shall, if applicable, inform the accused of his or her right to lodge an appeal on points of law, and inform him or her of the time-limit for such an appeal.” “In the event of a breach of the law, judgments of indictment divisions and judgments of the criminal courts against which no ordinary appeal lies may be set aside on an appeal on points of law to the Court of Cassation lodged by the public prosecutor or by the party adversely affected, according to the distinctions made hereafter. Such appeals shall be lodged with the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation.” “Judgments of indictment divisions and judgments of trial and appellate courts against which no ordinary appeal lies and which comply with the formal requirements laid down by statute may be quashed only on grounds of a breach of the law.” “Such judgments shall be declared null and void if they are not delivered by the prescribed number of judges or have been delivered by judges who have not attended all the hearings in the case. Where several hearings have been held in one and the same case, the judges who have taken part in the decision shall be presumed to have attended all of them. Such judgments shall also be declared null and void if they have been delivered without submissions having been heard from the public prosecutor. Subject to the exceptions laid down by law, judgments which have not been delivered, or in respect of which the proceedings have not been conducted in open court, shall also be declared null and void.” “Judgments of indictment divisions and judgments against which no ordinary appeal lies shall be declared null and void if they contain no reasons or if the reasons are insufficient and do not enable the Court of Cassation to exercise its power of review and to ascertain that the law has been complied with in the operative provisions. The same rule shall apply in the event of a failure or refusal to rule either on one or more applications by the parties or on one or more applications by the public prosecutor.” “In criminal matters, the judgment by the indictment division committing the accused for trial shall, when it has become final, determine the jurisdiction of the assize court and cover all procedural defects, should any exist, arising from the previous proceedings.”",[],[],[],['6'],['6-1'],[],0
50,001-78785,ENG,HRV,ADMISSIBILITY,2006,PILIPOVIC v. CROATIA,4,Inadmissible,Christos Rozakis,"The applicant, Mr Branko Pilipović, who is of Serbian origin and whose nationality is unknown, was born in 1956 and lives in Johova, Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was represented before the Court by Mrs B. Isailović, a lawyer practising in Paris. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs Š. Stažnik. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 2 March 1990 the Sisak Employment Tribunal (Osnovni sud udruženog rada u Sisku) gave judgment ordering company A. (“the company”) to pay the applicant the amount of 801.80 Yugoslav dinars (“YUD”) together with the pertaining statutory interest and the litigation costs. The judgment became final on 7 November 1990 when it was upheld by the Employment Tribunal of Croatia (Sud udruženog rada Hrvatske). On 21 March 1991 the applicant applied to the Sisak Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Sisku) for enforcement of the above judgment. On 27 March 1991 the Municipal Court issued a writ of execution (rješenje o izvršenju) ordering the financial institution operating the company’s account (Služba društvenog knjigovodstva, subsequently Zavod za platni promet and eventually Financijska agencija) (“the FINA”) to collect the amount corresponding to the applicant’s claim, i.e. 333,724.54 YUD, and transfer it to his account. On 11 April 1991 the company filed an objection (prigovor) to the writ. The applicant replied on 23 April 1991. On 2 December 1991 the Municipal Court dismissed the company’s objection and the writ thereby became final. It appears that on 4 February 1993 the writ was sent to the FINA in order to be carried out. The Government submitted that the proceedings had ended on 4 February 1993. However, since the case-file had been closed and, eventually, destroyed on 1 December 1998 pursuant to section 248 of the Courts’ Rules (see below under the Relevant domestic law), the Government were unable to specify whether the proceedings had been terminated because the applicant’s claim had been satisfied or for some other reason. The applicant submitted that in July 1991 he had gone to stay with his parents in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He further submitted that due to the escalation of the war in Croatia in October 1991, he had been unable to return. Thus, he had decided to stay in Bosnia and Herzegovina where he had later on been granted refugee status. The applicant also submitted that since April 1991 he had not received any information from the Sisak Municipal Court concerning his case. On 3 December 1999 he wrote to the Sisak Municipal Court asking it to continue the enforcement proceedings. He received no reply. On 3 May 2001 the applicant, through his advocate R.B., repeated his request. The court replied on 2 August 2001 informing the applicant’s advocate that the enforcement proceedings at issue had been discontinued and the case-file destroyed. On 15 May and 31 July 2002 the applicant again requested the Sisak Municipal Court to continue the enforcement proceedings. On 25 April 2003 he wrote to the President of the Sisak Municipal Court complaining that he had received no reply to his previous letters. The President replied on 29 May 2003 informing the applicant that the proceedings had ended on 4 December 1993, and the case-file had been destroyed on 1 December 1998. Meanwhile, following the applicant’s enquiry about the writ of execution, on 10 March 2003 the FINA – Sisak Office informed him that it had never received the writ from the Sisak Municipal Court. The 1991 Enforcement Proceedings Act (Zakon o izvršnom postupku, Official Gazette nos. 53/1991 and 91/1992), in force at the material time, did not provide for a possibility to continue enforcement proceedings that had already ended but only those that had been stayed or postponed (section 67). Moreover, the Act provided that a petition for reopening of a case (prijedlog za ponavljanje postupka) was not allowed as a remedy in the enforcement proceedings (section 9). The 1996 Enforcement Act (Ovršni zakon, Official Gazette nos. 57/1996), which entered into force on 11 September 1996, contains the same rules on continuation of the proceedings (sections 9 and 66) and reopening of a case (section 12). The Courts’ Rules (Sudski poslovnik, Official Gazette nos. 80/1997 and 20/98), as in force at the material time, regulated, inter alia, time-limits for keeping case-files in archives of the courts. They provided that the case-files concerning enforcement proceedings had to be kept for five years following the discontinuation or termination of such proceedings, unless they concerned rights in rem, in which case the files had to be kept for thirty years (section 248). After the expiry of those time-limits the case-files had to either be delivered to the institution keeping historical archives or be destroyed (section 247).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
51,001-75650,ENG,GBR,ADMISSIBILITY,2006,DEARNLEY v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,4,Inadmissible,Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant, Mr Robert Dearnley, is a British national who was born in 1951 and lives in Guildford. The respondent Government are represented by their agent, Mr D. Walton, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. In 1991, the applicant and his wife entered into a form of agricultural tenancy agreement with the Guildford Borough Council which involved the applicant and his wife setting up and running a demonstration farm. Clause 13 provided that “Any question difference or dispute which may arise between the landlord and the tenants ... not being a matter compulsorily referred to arbitration under the Agricultural Holdings Acts shall if the parties cannot settle it by agreement be referred to a single arbitrator to be appointed by the parties hereto or in default of agreement ... by the President for the time being of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors on the application of the landlord or the tenants.” After a series of disputes with the council, the applicant asked for an arbitrator to be appointed. According to the applicant, in February 1997 the President of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors appointed an arbitrator. In an opinion of 18/19 June 1997, the Bar Pro Bono Unit, in stating that the case fell outside the parameters of the Pro Bono scheme, made a number of comments on the case. In particular, it noted that clause 13 of the tenancy agreement did not stipulate the Act under which the arbitration should be carried out, did not stipulate the procedure or law to be applied, and did not expressly remove the jurisdiction of the courts. On 1 or 2 July 1997 the applicant brought proceedings against the Council in the Guildford County Court (GU 770520) for, amongst other things, misrepresentation, negligence and breach of contract. In his claim, he asked the court whether an arbitrator could consider all the points in the claim, or whether the applicant could proceed in the courts on the ground that he had entered into the contract as a result of misrepresentation or, alternatively, whether an arbitrator could deal with some claims whilst the courts dealt with the others. He also included a series of allegations of misrepresentation, breach of contract and deception and misinformation. The court stayed the proceedings on 6 August 1997: the Government suggested that by the stay the court was declining jurisdiction over the applicant’s claims on the basis that he had agreed that those claims would be dealt with by an arbitrator. A further application by the applicant, of 11 December 1997, was dismissed on 14 April 1998, and the applicant’s appeal was adjourned on 19 October 1998 pending an application for legal aid. Leave to withdraw the appeal was granted on 3 November 1998, and on 16 June 1999 the council’s costs (which the applicant was to pay) were fixed at £2,823.90. On 23 April 1999 the applicant and his wife and the council signed an agreement by which a series of disputes were referred to an arbitrator in accordance with the Arbitration Act 1996. The disputes were defined by reference to seven bundles. Bundle A included the matters which formed part of the applicant’s action before the county court. Since then, it appears that the arbitrator has made two interim awards in the applicant’s favour, in February 2001 and October 2002, but that most of the matters referred to arbitration are still outstanding. On 3 August 2002 the applicant wrote to the Guildford county court, referring to section 24 of the Arbitration Act 1996 and asking for the arbitrator to be removed. On 18 September 2002 District Judge Derbyshire declined to dismiss the arbitrator even though he accepted that the delays in the case were inexcusable. The Court has not been supplied with the judge’s reasons for that decision, although it appears from a letter from the council to the arbitrator that the judge stated that he might have been prepared to change his decision if matters did not proceed at a faster pace.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
52,001-79282,ENG,DEU,CHAMBER,2007,CASE OF PALJIC v. GERMANY,3,No violation of Art. 6-1,Peer Lorenzen,"6. The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Blaichach, Germany. 7. Since July 1990 the applicant worked as a cleaner in a home for the care of mentally disabled persons. 8. On 11 August 1994 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having sexually abused Ms U., a mentally disabled resident of the said home. 9. On 14 February 1995 the Munich Public Prosecutor's Office charged the applicant with having attempted to sexually abuse Ms U. twice, once on an unspecified date at the end of 1993 or the beginning of 1994 (first charge) and a second time on 12 July 1994 (second charge). 10. On 29 February 1996 the Munich Regional Court II convicted the applicant on two charges of sexual abuse of a person unfit to defend herself and sentenced him to a cumulative sentence of three years' imprisonment (one year for the first charge and two years and six months for the second one). 11. On 5 September 1996, following the applicant's appeal on points of law, the Federal Court of Justice quashed the Regional Court's judgment and remitted the case to a different chamber of the Munich Regional Court. The Federal Court of Justice found that the Regional Court, in dismissing the defence's motion to obtain another report of a psychiatric expert, had made a procedural mistake. In view of the fact that witness U. had abused alcohol and tablets at a period in time prior to the offences, it was necessary to have her examined by a medical expert in order to verify whether she suffered from a mental illness affecting her ability to give correct evidence (Aussagetüchtigkeit). In these circumstances, it was not sufficient, as was done by the Regional Court, to have the witness's credibility examined by a psychological expert. 12. During an oral hearing on 15 December 1999, the sixth hearing in the case, the Munich Regional Court II heard further witnesses. It indicated to the parties that the offences in question could be qualified differently in law as Ms U. had not proved unable to defend herself. Following a short interruption of the hearing, the Regional Court discontinued the proceedings concerning the first charge preliminarily according to section 154 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 26 below) upon a motion by the Public Prosecutor's Office. The minutes of the hearing do not contain any reasons given either by the Public Prosecutor's Office or by the Regional Court for proceeding in this manner. It had not been possible throughout the proceedings to establish the exact date on which the offence underlying the first charge had been committed. 13. On 17 December 1999 the Munich Regional Court II convicted the applicant in respect of the remaining second charge of sexual abuse and of bodily injury and sentenced him to two years' imprisonment suspended on probation. The Regional Court based its judgment mainly on the evidence given by Ms U., who was the only eye-witness to the alleged crime. Relying on reports given by both a psychological and a psychiatric expert, the court noted that due to her slight mental disability, Ms U.'s ability to give correct evidence was considerably restricted. Nevertheless, it was convinced that Ms U.'s statements were correct. She had not reported the offence on her own motion, but had confessed it to her partner on the same day when the latter had noticed that she felt depressed. Her partner had then convinced her some days later to inform the management of the home of the incident. Numerous other signs, such as the fact that U. had not tried unnecessarily to incriminate the applicant and had no other motives to accuse him demonstrated that the witness was credible. Moreover, two further female witnesses had confirmed that the applicant had harassed them. 14. In the judgment, no reasons were given for discontinuing the proceedings in respect of the first charge. 15. On 20 December 1999 the applicant, represented by counsel, lodged an appeal on points of law with the Federal Court of Justice, which he reasoned on 13 March 2000. He complained, inter alia, that there was a procedural error as no reasons for discontinuing the proceedings in respect of the first charge emerged either from the Public Prosecutor's request to do so or from the Regional Court's decision to partly discontinue the proceedings or from its judgment. However, the Regional Court had not found witness U. to be credible in this respect, which was documented by the fact that it had decided to discontinue the proceedings pursuant to section 154 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The reasons for discontinuing the proceedings could be essential for the evaluation of Ms U.'s credibility as both charges concerned similar offences and were primarily based on Ms U.'s assertions. If the Regional Court did not follow Ms U.'s testimony with respect to the first charge, it would have been necessary to explain why that court found the same witness's testimony to be credible with respect to the second charge. 16. On 18 April 2000 the General Public Prosecutor requested the court to dismiss the applicant's appeal on points of law as ill-founded. He argued in particular that no reasons had to be given for partly discontinuing the proceedings pursuant to section 154 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 17. In his submissions in reply dated 9 May 2000, the applicant agreed that section 154 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure did not prescribe that reasons had to be given for the discontinuance of the proceedings. However, failure to do so nevertheless rendered the evaluation of evidence defective in the circumstances of the present case. 18. On 30 May 2000 the Federal Court of Justice rejected the applicant's appeal on points of law. In respect of the said procedural error complained of, it dismissed his appeal on points of law as inadmissible, finding that the applicant had not sufficiently set out the facts which were relevant for his complaint as required by section 344 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 26 below). 19. The court agreed with the applicant's submission that “in cases in which the charges for two offences were based on the statement of only one witness and the proceedings were discontinued pursuant to section 154 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in respect of one of these offences, the reasons to do so can have evidential value for the decisive question of the credibility of the sole witness for the prosecution; if no grounds for discontinuing the proceedings are given, there is a lack of reasoning (Erörterungsmangel) (see Federal Court of Justice, Strafverteidiger (StV) 1998, pp. 580, 582).” 20. However, what had been discussed in the hearing before the Regional Court discontinued the proceedings pursuant to section 154 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure could not be known by having regard to the text of the judgment alone, as there was no duty to mention the discontinuance of the proceedings pursuant to that section or the reasons therefor in the judgment. It was true that there were judgments in which courts had set out in detail the reasons for partly discontinuing the proceedings and the influence of that decision on the evaluation of evidence, but this was only done if the court saw reasons to do so. 21. In the present case, the Federal Court of Justice was unable to ascertain on the basis of the applicant's reasoning in his appeal alone whether there had been a procedural error assuming that the facts submitted by him proved to be true (the court referred to its previous decisions published in the Neue Juristische Wochenschrift (NJW) 1995, p. 2047 and StV 1996, p. 530 in this respect). 22. According to the Federal Court of Justice, “what is missing is a statement as to which reasons, if any, for discontinuing the proceedings were orally discussed during the court's hearing, because the failure to give reasons for the discontinuance could only constitute a procedural error if these reasons could have had an influence on the outcome of the judgment, such as doubts about the credibility of the statements of the only prosecution witness.” 23. The Federal Court of Justice noted that as a rule, proceedings were not discontinued pursuant to section 154 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure without any comments, despite the fact that there was no duty to record such statements in the minutes. If, in exceptional circumstances, no comments were made, the appellant was at least obliged expressly to state that the court had not given any other grounds, such as a limitation of the offences at issue in the proceedings for reasons of efficiency, which were irrelevant for the evaluation of evidence. 24. On 7 September 2000 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court. He argued that his rights to be heard and to a fair trial were violated as in its decision the Federal Court of Justice had applied new admissibility criteria which he could not have foreseen. According to the applicant, the Federal Court of Justice, in its previous case-law, had demanded an account of the oral statements during the hearing only if the minutes disclosed that there had been such statements at all. Now on the contrary, that same court asked for an account of statements which (might) have been made in the course of the hearing and which were not included in the record. 25. On 15 October 2000 the Federal Constitutional Court, sitting as a panel of three judges, refused to admit the applicant's constitutional complaint. The decision was served on the applicant's counsel on 19 October 2000. 26. The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure read as follows: Section 154 [Insignificant further offences] “(1) The Public Prosecutor's Office may dispense with prosecuting an offence 1. if the penalty or the measure of correction and prevention (Maβregel der Besserung und Sicherung) in which the prosecution might result is not particularly significant compared to a penalty or measure of correction and prevention which was imposed with binding effect upon the defendant for another offence or which he has to expect for another offence, or 2. furthermore, if a judgment for such offence is not to be expected within a reasonable time and if the penalty or the measure of correction and prevention which was imposed with binding effect upon the defendant or which he has to expect for another offence, appears sufficient to have an influence on the offender and to defend the legal order. (2) If public charges have already been preferred, the court may provisionally discontinue the proceedings upon the motion of the Public Prosecutor's Office at any stage. ... (4) If the proceedings were discontinued provisionally on account of a penalty or measure of correction and prevention which was to be expected for another offence, the proceedings may be resumed, unless barred by limitation in the meantime, within three months after the judgment delivered in respect of the other offence became final.” Section 344 [Reasoning of an appeal on points of law] “(1) The appellant shall make a statement on the extent to which he contests the judgment and applies for it to be quashed (notices of appeal on points of law) and shall give reasons for his motions. (2) The reasoning must show whether the judgment is contested because of a violation of the law of procedure or because of a violation of a different legal provision. In the former case the facts which constitute the defect have to be set out.” Section 345 [Time-limit for reasoning the appeal on points of law] “(...) (2) The defendant may only do so [i.e. submit notices of appeal and the grounds therefor] in the form of observations signed by defence counsel or a lawyer or orally to be recorded by the court's registry.” Section 273 [Recording of the main hearing] “(1) The record must indicate the course and the results of the main hearing in essence, and show that all essential formalities have been observed; it must also specify the documents read out or those documents the reading of which has been dispensed with ..., as well as the applications filed during the course of the hearing, the decisions given, and the operative provisions of the judgment. (2) The main outcome of questionings in the main hearing ... shall also be included in the record; ...” Section 274 [Probative value of the record] “Observance of the formalities required for the main hearing can only be proved by the record. Against the contents of the record concerning these formalities only proof of forgery is possible.” 27. Pursuant to the well-established case-law of the Federal Court of Justice, an appellant alleging a violation of a procedural rule must set out the facts which constitute the defect within the meaning of section 344 § 2, second sentence, of the Code of Criminal Procedure in such a comprehensive and detailed manner that the appellate court is in a position to verify on the basis of the appellant's reasoning alone whether there would be a procedural error if the alleged facts were proved. It is not only necessary for the appellant not to omit facts weighing against him, but also to submit facts militating in favour of exceptional circumstances which would render his complaint unfounded. Depending on the nature of the violation of the procedural rule, the Federal Court of Justice developed special requirements in its case-law on how to reason an appeal on points of law (see the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court of 25 January 2005, nos. 2 BvR 656/99, 2 BvR 657/99 and 2 BvR 683/99, § 92 with many references to decisions taken by the Federal Court of Justice between 1982 and 2002). 28. In its decision of 25 January 2005 (cited in paragraph 27 above) the Federal Constitutional Court examined the constitutionality of the requirements set up in the case-law of the Federal Court of Justice which an appellant has to satisfy in order to lodge an admissible appeal on points of law about a procedural error in accordance with section 344 § 2, second sentence, of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The Federal Constitutional Court found that as a rule, these requirements did not violate the individuals' right to effective legal protection and did not limit access to the Federal Court of Justice in an arbitrary manner (see §§ 91-108 of the decision). It stressed that the interpretation of the said section by the Federal Court of Justice served to prevent that court from being overcharged, which would itself compromise an effective legal protection (see § 107 of the decision). 29. The Federal Court of Justice, in its decision of 9 March 1995 (no. 4 StR 77/95, NJW 1995, p. 2047), considered an appeal on points of law lodged by the Public Prosecutor's Office complaining about a procedural error to be inadmissible for failure to comply with the requirements of section 344 § 2, second sentence, of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It found that the appellant failed to set out all the facts which constituted the defect in such a comprehensive and detailed manner that the appellate court was in a position to verify on the basis of the appellant's reasoning alone whether there would be a procedural error if the alleged facts were proved. The submissions failed to give an account of the contents of the statements made by the defendant prior to the hearing before the police. 30. In its decision taken on 5 March 1996 (no. 5 StR 643/95, StV 1996, pp. 529-530) the Federal Court of Justice dismissed the defendant's appeal on points of law concerning a procedural error as inadmissible pursuant to section 344 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The appellant, who complained that his motion to appoint a further expert had wrongly been dismissed, despite the fact that the court-appointed expert allegedly lacked expertise, failed to set out the full contents of the report given by that expert. In so far as the appellant based his allegations on statements made by that expert during the hearing, the account given in the judgment of the discussion with the expert in the hearing proved that there was no lack of expertise on his part. Accordingly, the Federal Court of Justice was not in a position to verify whether the allegation of a lack of expertise was wellfounded. 31. On 29 July 1998 the Federal Court of Justice (no. 1 StR 94/98, StV 1998, pp. 580-582) allowed the defendant's appeal on points of law alleging that the law had been applied wrongly to the facts ascertained in the judgment (Sachrüge). The defendant had been charged with six counts of sexual abuse of children, which had all been based on the statements made by the only witness for the prosecution. He was acquitted as the witness had been proved to have invented the incident in respect of one count and convicted in respect of three other counts; in respect of two counts of sexual abuse the proceedings were discontinued pursuant to section 154 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. According to the Federal Court of Justice, the evaluation of evidence in the Regional Court's judgment was defective, inter alia, because that court had discontinued the proceedings in respect of two counts of sexual abuse of children without giving reasons therefore. In the circumstances of the case – there was notably only one witness for the prosecution, no further incriminating evidence and the defendant's innocence was established in respect of one of the comparable offences he had been charged with – the reasons for discontinuing the proceedings in respect of two further counts could have had evidential value for the decisive question of the credibility of the sole witness for the prosecution.",[],[],[],['6'],['6-1'],[],0
53,001-107997,ENG,SVN,ADMISSIBILITY,2011,MESIC v. SLOVENIA,4,Inadmissible,André Potocki;Angelika Nußberger;Ann Power-Forde;Dean Spielmann;Elisabet Fura;Ganna Yudkivska,"The applicant, Mr Jasmin Mešić, is a Slovenian national who was born in 1979. He was represented before the Court by Odvetniška Družba Matoz O.P. D.O.O., a law firm practising in Koper. The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs T. Mihelič Žitko, State Attorney. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant has been serving his sentence in the closed section of Dob Prison since 24 July 2006. As regards the facilities available to the applicant in the cells and common areas, as well as the health care regime in the prison, the conditions imposed on the applicant regarding activities outside the cells and contact with the outside world, see the Court’s decision in the case of Lalić and Others v. Slovenia (dec.), no. 5711/10 etc., 27 September 2011. The applicant has been held in different cells. Until 21 November 2009 he was held in Block 4 in cells measuring 59.25 square metres, in which the number of inmates varied between thirteen and sixteen (3.7 to 4.5 square metres of personal space available to each inmate). During this time he was on five occasions placed in Block 1 – for about thirteen months altogether, mostly for security reasons. There, he was held in cells accommodating no more than four inmates at a time, while most of the time each inmate had more than seven square metres of personal space, and never less than 3.9. The applicant was held in the same conditions in Block 1 between 21 November 2009 and 13 February 2010. Afterwards he was placed in Block 3, where he was held in cells measuring 59.89 square metres and accommodating between thirteen and fourteen inmates (4.2 to 4.6 square metres of personal space available to each inmate). The applicant has completed his primary education in prison, and is continuing with secondary education, including food-preparation and catering classes. During the initial months of his imprisonment he worked in the Pohorje Public Institute (agricultural activities and metalwork), later he attended work therapy sessions. The applicant suffers from hepatitis C. Further to the results of the blood test which confirmed that he had this disease, received on 17 August 2006, he was referred to a specialist in order to undergo an examination. He underwent an abdominal ultrasound in December 2006. On 29 March 2010, following the applicant’s notifying the prison doctor about his hepatitis C infection, he was again referred to the specialist and underwent a further abdominal ultrasound. The doctor specialised in this field found that the applicant was chronically ill with hepatitis C, and should undergo appropriate medical treatment. A liver biopsy was scheduled for October 2010, but was postponed. Between 6 and 8 December 2010, the applicant was hospitalised in General Hospital Novo Mesto in order to undergo a liver biopsy. According to a report dated 13 August 2010 drawn up by a prison doctor, the applicant had been treated in the prison clinic on ninety-nine occasions for various medical problems. He had not raised the issue of hepatitis C when visiting the prison doctor until March 2010. The additional report by the aforementioned doctor dated 7 December 2010 read, as far as relevant, as follows: “[The applicant] had not shown interest in continuing treatment and had not mentioned anything connected to the treatment of hepatitis C until 29 March 2010. The disease had not manifested itself during that period. In the opinion of the representative for the patient’s rights, M. P, ... the patient’s rights under the Patient Rights Act had not been breached [in the applicant’s case]. Section 54 of the aforementioned Act states that in order to obtain health care of good quality, the patient should actively participate in his or her treatment. Jasmin Mešić certainly had not actively participated in his treatment.” The applicant had also been visiting the prison psychiatrist and had for a while been undergoing methadone-maintenance treatment. According to the information submitted by the Government, in 2008 eighty-one prisoners in Dob prison were tested for hepatitis B and C, and seven were tested for HIV. Two were diagnosed with hepatitis B, and fifteen with hepatitis C. In 2009 sixty-five prisoners in Dob prison were tested for hepatitis B and C, while eight were tested for HIV. One was diagnosed with hepatitis B, and seven with hepatitis C. No one was diagnosed with HIV. For the relevant domestic law and practice, see paragraphs 33-35 and 38-47 of the Court’s judgment in the case of Štrucl and Others v. Slovenia (nos. 5903/10, 6003/10 and 6544/10, 27 September 2011), and paragraphs 34-36 of Mandić and Jović v. Slovenia (nos. 5774/10 and 5985/10, 27 September 2011), as well as Lalić and Others, cited above. In addition, the Patient Rights Act (Official Gazette no. 15/2008, entry into force on 26 August 2008) provides for procedures for dealing with complaints concerning, inter alia, inadequate medical treatment or care. In accordance with the provisions of that Act, a patient can lodge a complaint directly with a health-care provider. If unsatisfied, he or she can complain to the Commission for Protection of Patients Rights. Ultimately, a patient whose complaint has been unsuccessful can challenge the decisions made in his or her case before the Administrative Court. The Act also regulates the work of the Representative for Patients’ Rights, whose main role is to assist, provide advice to and represent patients in the exercise of their rights provided therein.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
54,001-60166,ENG,FRA,CHAMBER,2002,CASE OF DEL SOL v. FRANCE,1,No violation of Art. 6-1,Nicolas Bratza,"8. By a judgment of 6 October 1995, the Paris tribunal de grande instance made a divorce order terminating the marriage of Mr and Mrs Del Sol, ordered the liquidation and partition of the matrimonial property, set the level of maintenance to be paid to the applicant at 1,300 French francs (FRF) monthly and dismissed a claim for damages by the applicant. 9. On 8 December 1995 the applicant appealed against that judgment, stating, inter alia, that her husband, the petitioner in the proceedings, had failed to satisfy the conditions set out in the Civil Code, as he had no rights in the assets he had offered to leave her. She argued in the alternative that a divorce would cause her exceptional hardship and that her husband's petition should be dismissed in accordance with Article 240 of the Civil Code, which empowered the court to dismiss a divorce petition if the respondent showed that “the divorce would cause the respondent ... or the children exceptional material or psychological hardship ...”. The applicant also sought maintenance in the form of monthly payments of FRF 3,000. 10. On 25 February 1997 the Paris Court of Appeal upheld all the provisions of the impugned judgment, with the exception of the decision relating to maintenance, which was reduced to FRF 1,000 monthly. It held, inter alia, that the applicant's husband satisfied all the conditions on which the admissibility of the divorce petition depended, as he had offered to assign to the applicant his rights in property which the couple jointly owned in Italy. It further held that the applicant had failed to show that the divorce would cause her exceptional hardship, either psychologically or materially. 11. On 20 May 1997 the applicant applied to the Legal Aid Office at the Court of Cassation for legal aid to enable her to appeal to that court against the Court of Appeal's decision. Her application was refused on 2 April 1998 on the ground that no arguable ground of appeal could be made out against the impugned judgment. The Legal Aid Office noted, however, that the applicant satisfied the means test for legal aid. 12. On 22 May 1998 the applicant appealed against that decision. By an order of 11 June 1998 the President of the Court of Cassation upheld it, holding that the Legal Aid Office had “found no arguable ground of appeal after assessing the facts of the case in its unfettered discretion”. 13. The French system of legal aid enabling persons of limited means to assert their right through the courts was established by Law no. 91-647 of 10 July 1991 and its implementing Decree no. 91-1266 of 19 December 1991. Under Article 33 of the decree: “Applications for legal aid ... shall contain the following information: ... the purpose of the application and a brief summary of the reasons”. Applications for legal aid are examined by the legal aid office of the court dealing with the case in respect of which the application is made. The Legal Aid Office at the Court of Cassation is composed of a judge of that court, who acts as its president, the senior registrar who acts as vice-president, two members chosen by the Court of Cassation, two civil servants, two court officers one at least of whom must be a lawyer and a member appointed by the general public (section 16 of the Law). The Legal Aid Office may refuse an application under section 7(3) of the Law, which provides: “In cases before the Court of Cassation, an application for legal aid shall be refused if no arguable ground of appeal can be made out.” An appeal lies against a decision of the Legal Aid Office to the President of the Court of Cassation (section 23 of the Law).",[],[],[],['6'],['6-1'],[],0
55,001-83781,ENG,DEU,ADMISSIBILITY,2007,GRUBER v. GERMANY,4,Inadmissible,Peer Lorenzen,"The applicant, Mr Karl-Heinz Gruber, is a German national who was born in 1942 and lives in Berlin. He was represented before the Court by Mr C. Lenz, a lawyer practising in Stuttgart. On 6 March 2000 the Berlin Regional Court convicted the applicant of seventy-one counts of fraudulent breach of trust (Untreue) and sentenced him to a cumulative sentence of two years’ imprisonment suspended on probation and a fine of 3,600 Deutschmarks (DEM). It found that the applicant, as a liquidator employed by the Treuhand agency (Treuhandanstalt), had embezzled a total of more than eleven million Deutschmarks belonging to the various firms he had liquidated or to the Treuhand agency itself. In particular, he had received money for a stock corporation he was liquidating and, contrary to a decision made by its shareholders to pay part of the sum to the Jewish Claims Conference, had transferred some 1,93 million Deutschmarks to another company to conceal damage he had previously caused. The applicant had decided to embezzle money as the Treuhand agency had failed to pay him the supplementary commissions he had claimed under his contracts with it. In fixing the sentence of one year’s imprisonment for the most serious count of fraudulent breach of trust (compare ‘Relevant domestic law’ below), the court considered as an aggravating factor the extraordinarily high amount of damage caused, amounting to almost two million Deutschmarks. On 19 December 2000 the Federal Court of Justice, allowing the appeal on points of law lodged by the Public Prosecutor’s Office solely against the fixing of the sentence, quashed the Regional Court’s judgment in this respect and remitted the case to a different chamber of the Regional Court. It left open whether, having regard to the amount of damage caused, the very mild sentence imposed could still be considered as an appropriate sanction. In any event, the Regional Court had, inter alia, unlawfully taken into consideration grounds for granting probation when fixing the sentence itself. On 16 July 2001 the Berlin Regional Court sentenced the applicant to a cumulative sentence of two years and six months’ imprisonment – a sentence which could not be suspended on probation (see ‘Relevant domestic law’ below) – for forty-five counts of fraudulent breach of trust. It had previously discontinued the proceedings in respect of twenty-six counts of fraudulent breach of trust in view of the sentence the applicant had to expect for the remaining counts he had been found guilty of. In fixing the sentence of one year and six months’ imprisonment for the most serious count of fraudulent breach of trust (compare ‘Relevant domestic law’ below), the Regional Court considered in mitigation that the applicant had confessed to the offences and regretted them, that he had no previous convictions and that he made serious efforts to redress the damage caused. Moreover, the proceedings had been lengthy and he might be prohibited from further exercising his profession as a tax consultant. Furthermore, following recent developments in the case-law, the applicant might be able to enforce the payment of supplementary commissions he had claimed from his former employer. As aggravating circumstances the Regional Court took into consideration that the applicant had caused very serious damage amounting to 1,93 million Deutschmarks and that he had flagrantly breached his duty as a tax consultant to keep accounts for assets not belonging to him separated from his own accounts. By withdrawing and transferring money on his own motion to settle his claims against his employer at that time instead of enforcing them in court, the applicant had negligently handled the assets of others in breach of his duties and had recklessly pursued his own profit. Moreover, the court considered as an aggravating factor that the applicant had embezzled money which belonged to, inter alia, the Jewish Claims Conference, whereby, against the background of German history, he had touched upon a very sensitive issue. The Regional Court noted that, compared to other cases in which a similarly grave damage had been caused, the cumulative sentence imposed was comparatively low, which was mainly owing to the fact that the applicant could now most probably enforce his claim for supplementary commissions before the civil courts. On 28 September 2001 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. He complained that the Regional Court had considered as an aggravating factor that his offence had affected assets belonging to the Jewish Claims Conference. This was not an element which could lawfully be taken into account in determining his penalty. In his submissions dated 5 February 2002, the Federal Public Prosecutor General argued that the Regional Court, in referring to the fact that the applicant had embezzled money which should have been transferred to the Jewish Claims Conference, took account of the way in which the applicant had committed his offence and its background, which were permissible criteria for fixing a sentence under section 46 § 2 of the Criminal Code (see ‘Relevant domestic law’ below). On 5 March 2002 the Federal Court of Justice, without giving reasons, dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law as ill-founded. On 12 April 2002 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court. Setting out the course of the proceedings before the criminal courts and the reasons given for their decisions, he complained that his sentence had been fixed at two years and six months’ imprisonment by reference to the fact that he had embezzled assets belonging to the Jewish Claims Conference. He had to serve this sentence as, contrary to his initial sentence, it exceeded two years and could therefore no longer be suspended on probation. He had been imposed an executable prison sentence contrary to the rule of law and arbitrarily. In particular, the courts had failed to verify whether he had known at the time of the offence in August 1998 that the Jewish Claims Conference was affected by his acts. Its involvement had in fact become apparent only in November 1998 when the decision on the distribution of the assets belonging to the company in liquidation had been taken. In any event, it had been a share of less than ten per cent of the amount of money in liquidation which had been claimed by the heirs of former associates of the company in liquidation who were represented by the Jewish Claims Conference. Moreover, by taking this criterion into account the courts had treated proprietors differently on grounds of their race or religion contrary to the right to equal treatment. On 2 October 2002 the Federal Constitutional Court communicated the complaint to the Government of the Land Berlin and the Federal Court of Justice for observations. The Berlin Ministry of Justice (Senatsverwaltung) arranged for the execution of the applicant’s prison sentence to be suspended while the proceedings were pending before the Federal Constitutional Court following that court’s informal request to do so. In its observations of 3 December 2002 the Federal Court of Justice recalled that according to its case-law, only foreseen or foreseeable consequences of an offence could be considered as aggravating circumstances. On 3 September 2004 the Federal Constitutional Court declined to consider the applicant’s constitutional complaint and declared that the motion for an injunction was therefore disposed of (file no. 2 BvR 587/02). The Federal Constitutional Court found that it was not necessary to consider the applicant’s complaint in order to enforce his rights as the violation he alleged was neither severe nor did he suffer a particularly grave disadvantage by not obtaining a decision on the merits. The court noted that the applicant complained only that the Regional Court, in fixing his sentence, had wrongfully considered as an aggravating factor that he had embezzled assets belonging to the Jewish Claims Conference. However, even assuming that the impugned criterion had not been taken into consideration in determining his punishment, the Regional Court would not have imposed a different sentence. The Regional Court, in fixing the sentence for the most severe count of fraudulent breach of trust, had not attached decisive importance to the fact that the applicant had embezzled assets belonging to the Jewish Claims Conference. It had mainly taken into account the amount of damage the applicant had caused (DEM 1,930,000), the disrespect of his professional duties as a tax consultant and his reprehensible pursuit of personal profit. Having regard to the enormous damage caused by the most severe count of fraudulent breach of trust alone, the impugned criterion could not have had a decisive influence on the sentence fixed. In these circumstances, the applicant did not suffer a particularly grave disadvantage by not obtaining a decision of the Federal Constitutional Court. Section 46 of the Criminal Code lays down the principles to be observed in determining a perpetrator’s punishment. The guilt of the perpetrator is the basis for fixing the punishment (section 46 § 1). In fixing the penalty, the court shall counterbalance the circumstances being in the perpetrator’s favour and against him, in particular his motives and aims, the extent of the breach of his duties, the manner in which the offence was executed and its consequences caused by fault of the perpetrator, his past life, personal and financial circumstances and his conduct after the offence (section 46 § 2). If a perpetrator committed more than one offence and thus incurred more than one term of imprisonment or more than one fine, the court, when giving its judgment on these offences at the same time, shall fix a cumulative sentence (section 53 § 1 of the Criminal Code). The cumulative sentence shall be fixed by increasing the severest sentence or fine incurred (section 54 § 1 of the Criminal Code). Pursuant to section 56 of the Criminal Code, the court may, under certain circumstances, suspend on probation the execution of a prison term which does not exceed two years. The court may grant probation if it can be expected that the conviction as such will already serve the convicted person as a warning and that he will not commit any further offences in the future even without the influence exerted by the execution of the sentence. Moreover, a comprehensive evaluation of the act and personality of the convicted person must reveal the presence of special circumstances.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
56,001-22713,ENG,HRV,ADMISSIBILITY,2002,JEFTIC v. CROATIA,4,Inadmissible,Christos Rozakis,"The applicant, Mr Milan Jeftić, is a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who was born in 1947 and lives in Derventa, Bosnia and Herzegovina. The respondent Government are represented by their Agent Ms Lidija Lukina-Krajković. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant was an employee of the Croatian company “Graditelj”, in Grubišno Polje, Croatia. On 25 May 1989 he had an accident at his workplace and suffered injuries. Since then he has mostly been on sick-leave. On 28 August 1991 the applicant obtained a certificate from the Kutina Health Insurance Fund (Republički fond zdravstvene zaštite Kutina) that the Croatian Health Insurance Fund covered sick-leave allowance regardless of the applicants’ place of living. The applicant left Croatia some time in the autumn of 1991 and went to live in Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 13 January 1992 the company sent him a letter informing him that they had terminated his contract of employment as of 30 September 1991 since the Croatian Health Insurance Fund had refused to pay his sick-leave allowance. On 22 January 1992 the applicant claimed a sick-leave allowance as from 1 October 1990 before the Croatian Health Insurance Fund, Grubišno Polje Office (Republički fond zdravstvenog osiguranja i zdravstva Hrvatske - Ispostava Grubišno Polje). He relied on the Kutina Health Insurance Fund’s certificate. This request was rejected on 10 March 1992 by the Croatian Health Insurance Fund in Grubišno Polje. It was found that the applicant received sick-leave allowance for the period from 29 May 1991 until 30 September 1991. The last time he had attended an examination before a medical experts’ commission in charge of grating sick-leave was on 10 September 1991. After that he had left for Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Fund did not accept medical certificates from Bosnia and Herzegovina because, according to Croatian laws, the applicant had to present himself in person before a medical experts’ commission in Croatia in order to have his sick-leave prolonged. On 16 March 1992 the applicant appealed against that decision to the Appellate Commission of the Croatian Health Insurance Fund (Direkcija republičkog fonda zdravstvenog osiguranja i zdravstva Hrvatske). According to the applicant, on 18 November 1997 and 19 February 1999, respectively, he lodged requests with the Appellate Commission for speeding up the proceedings. He received no reply. As the above Commission failed to decide upon the applicant’s appeal, on 3 June 1999 he instituted administrative proceedings in the Administrative Court (Upravni Sud Republike Hrvatske) asking it to decide the matter. On 9 December 1999 he lodged a request for speeding up the proceedings, but received no reply. It appears that the proceedings are still pending before that court. According to the Government on 17 June 1992 the Appellate Commission of the Croatian Health Insurance Fund rejected the applicant’s appeal of 16 March 1992. Since the postal services with Bosnia and Herzegovina at that time were interrupted, the decision was placed on the Fund’s public notice-board. As regards the applicant’s claim before the Administrative Court, the Government submit that on 21 November 2001 the court invited the applicant to inform it whether he wished to extend his claim against the second instance decision. Section 26 (1) of the Administrative Disputes Act (Zakon o upravnim sporovima) allows an applicant to lodge a claim in the Administrative Court if an appellate body does not issue a decision upon his appeal within 60 days followed by an additional period of seven days upon the applicant’s repeated request. Section 42 of the same Act provides that the Administrative Court must either instruct the lower bodies on how to resolve the case or resolve the case itself. Section 26 of the Constitutional Act on the Changes of the Constitutional Act on the Constitutional Court (entered into force on 15 March 2002, published in the Official Gazette no. 29 of 22 March 2002 - hereinafter “The Act of 15 March 2002” - Ustavni zakon o izmjenama i dopunama Ustavnog zakona o Ustavnom sudu Republike Hrvatske) introduced a new Section 59 (a), which subsequently became Section 63 of the 2002 Constitutional Act on the Constitutional Court. The relevant parts of that Section read as follows: (1) The Constitutional Court shall examine a constitutional complaint even before all legal remedies have been exhausted in cases when a competent court has not decided within a reasonable time a claim concerning the applicant’s rights and obligations or a criminal charge against him ... (2) If the constitutional complaint ... under paragraph 1 of this Section is accepted, the Constitutional Court shall determine a time-limit within which a competent court shall decide the case on the merits... (3) In a decision under paragraph 2 of this Article, the Constitutional Court shall fix appropriate compensation for the applicant in respect of the violation found concerning his constitutional rights ... The compensation shall be paid from the State budget within a term of three months from the date when the party lodged a request for its payment.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

He is represented before the Court by Ms Banasik, a lawyer practising in Łódź. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. On 8 August 1997 the Łódź District Court convicted the applicant of uttering threats and battering his wife and sentenced him to four years’ imprisonment, with execution of the sentence stayed for a probationary period of four years. On 9 December 1997 the Łódź Regional Court dismissed his appeal. The applicant lodged with the Łódź Regional Court a cassation appeal within the thirty days’ time-limit provided for by law, alleging various procedural shortcomings which, in his argument, negatively affected both his defence rights and the outcome of the case. The Regional Court, having examined the appeal, found that it complied with the formal requirements specified by the Code of Criminal Procedure and subsequently forwarded it to the Supreme Court. On 20 December 2000 the Supreme Court, at a court session held in camera, dismissed his cassation appeal as manifestly ill-founded. Under the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1998 a party to criminal proceedings can lodge a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court against a final judgment of the appellate court, which has terminated the proceedings. The cassation appeal has to be drafted and signed by a lawyer. A cassation appeal can be lodged only on the grounds referred to in Article 439 of the Code. These grounds include certain procedural shortcomings, which justify quashing of a first-instance decision, regardless of whether they are invoked by the party lodging any remedy against such decision (for example, wrong composition of the court, lack of legal assistance in cases where such assistance was compulsory, violation of the rules governing jurisdiction of criminal courts, certain breaches of defence rights). A cassation appeal can also be lodged on the ground of another flagrant breach of law, if such a breach negatively affected the judicial decision under appeal. Article 530 of the Code provides that the court which gave the decision appealed against is competent to decide whether the formal requirements for a cassation appeal are satisfied, and to refuse to accept the appeal, if this is not the case. If the appeal is admissible, it is forwarded to the Supreme Court. Pursuant to Article 535 of the Code, as amended on 20 July 2000 to take effect as of 1 September 2000, the Supreme Court shall consider the cassation appeal against a judgment at a hearing. However, it is open to the Court to dismiss such appeal at a session held in camera, if it considers that it is manifestly ill-founded. No written grounds shall be prepared for such a decision.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
58,001-81724,ENG,DEU,ADMISSIBILITY,2007,POZNANSKI AND OTHERS v. GERMANY,3,Inadmissible,Peer Lorenzen,"The application was lodged with the Court by Mr Mordechai Poznanski, Mr Jakob Silberstein, Mrs Erna Stasiak and in the name of Mr David Handwohl. Mr Poznanski and Mr Silberstein, born in 1925 and 1924 respectively, are Israeli nationals and reside in Israel. Mr Handwohl, who was born in 1923 and died on 29 May 2005, was a U.S. national. Mrs Stasiak is a Polish national and resides in Poland. They are represented before the Court by Ms S. Reppenhagen, a lawyer practising in Berlin. The respondent Government are represented by their agent, Mrs A. Wittling-Vogel, Ministerialdirigentin, of the Federal Ministry of Justice. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. During the Second World War Mr Poznanski, Mr Silberstein, Mr Handwohl and Mrs Stasiak’s late husband Leon Stasiak, then Polish nationals, were subjected to forced labour in the Auschwitz-Monowitz concentration camp which was operated by the I.G. Farbenindustrie Corporation (I.G. Farbenindustrie AG). The forced labourers had to carry out physically hard work for 84 hours a week without receiving adequate nutrition. Once they were no longer physically capable of working, the forced labourers were sent to the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp to be killed. Mr Poznanski, Mr Silberstein and Mr Handwohl, who are of Jewish faith, and Mrs Stasiak’s late husband had been arrested by the German army following the occupation of Poland. Having been detained in several concentration camps, they were finally transferred to the Auschwitz-Monowitz concentration camp, where they remained until their liberation by the Red Army in January 1945. Following the end of the Second World War, the allied forces split up the I.G. Farbenindustrie Corporation inter alia into the companies Bayer, Hoechst and BASF. Legal successor to the corporation was the I.G. Farbenindustrie Corporation in liquidation (I.G. Farbenindustrie AG in Abwicklung, “IG Farben”). The Federal Republic of Germany, after its foundation on 23 May 1949, did not establish any compensation schemes for forced labourers. Under the London Agreement on Germany’s External Debts (London Debt Agreement) of 27 February 1953, the regulation of compensation claims was deferred until the final settlement of reparation. Subsequently many actions brought by former forced labourers against German companies were rejected with reference to the London Debt Agreement. Nevertheless, the Federal Republic of Germany paid compensation to victims of the Nazi regime, mostly to those who were living in Israel, the Federal Republic of Germany and other Western European States, in particular pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Act on Compensation for Victims of Nazi Persecution (Bundesentschädigungs-gesetz), which entered into force on 1 October 1953. It provides inter alia compensation for the detention in a concentration camp and the resulting damage to the health of the former detainees. Forced labour as such was not covered by the existing legislation. Mr Poznanski received payments of 8,100 Deutschmarks (DEM) in 1957 and 21,705 DEM in 1964, as well as a monthly pension of 136 DEM as of 1 June 1964. In 1989 he received additional payments of 3,271 and 10,365 DEM and his monthly pension was increased from 580 to 723 DEM. As of August 2004 the applicant has been in receipt of a monthly pension of 526 euros (EUR). Mr Silberstein received a payment of 10,050 DEM in 1959. On 6 February 1957 IG Farben and the Conference on Jewish Material Claims against Germany (“Jewish Claims Conference”) entered into a friendly settlement during the course of a lawsuit brought by a former forced labourer (the so-called Wollheim case). Pursuant to that settlement I.G. Farben undertook to pay 30 million DEM to its former forced labourers. Mr Poznanski and Mr Silberstein received 5,000 DEM each under that settlement. Although the settlement stipulated that the recipients were to waive all further claims against I.G. Farben, it is not clear whether the applicants signed such a waiver. After 1990 the Federal Republic of Germany paid lump sums to several Eastern European States, which then created funds for victims of the Nazi regime. The Federal Republic of Germany paid 500 million DEM to a Polish foundation, which then granted compensation to former detainees of concentration camps. That Polish foundation granted Mrs Stasiak’s late husband benefits amounting to 3,780 new Polish zlotys (PLN) on 19 March 1993 and 4,301 PLN on 9 June 1997. However, individual compensation for forced labour as such was still not provided by the Federal Republic of Germany. Many of those former forced labourers brought actions against German companies, in particular class action suits in the United States of America. Against that background the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Government of the United States of America concluded a treaty that envisaged the creation of the foundation “Remembrance, Responsibility and Future” (Stiftung “Erinnerung, Verantwortung und Zukunft” - hereinafter called “Foundation”) which would provide individual compensation for former forced labourers. Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Jewish Claims Conference, legal representatives of former forced labourers and representatives of German industry had participated in those negotiations. In 1999 Mr Poznanski, Mr Silberstein, Mr Handwohl and Mrs Stasiak’s late husband brought actions for compensation for non-pecuniary damages and actions for restitution of the unjustified enrichment (Klage auf Herausgabe der ungerechtfertigten Bereicherung) against the I.G. Farben requesting between 40,000 DEM (20,452 EUR) and 70,000 DEM (35,790 EUR) each. On 12 August 2000 the “Law on the Creation of the Foundation “Remembrance, Responsibility and Future” (Gesetz zur Errichtung einer Stiftung “Erinnerung, Verantwortung und Zukunft” – hereinafter called “Foundation Law”) entered into force (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below). The Foundation was subsequently set up and both the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German companies provided for the Foundation’s funding. I.G. Farben did not make any contributions. The Frankfurt Regional Court rejected the actions stating that claims against I.G. Farben were excluded by the Foundation Law. Rejecting the claimants’ appeal the court held that their claims were excluded by the Foundation Law. Nevertheless, the court came to the conclusion that some of their claims had not been time-barred when the Foundation Law entered into force. At the outset the court recalled that the statute of limitations (Verjährung) for claims relating to forced labour during the Second World War had been suspended (gehemmt) by the London Debt Agreement. That suspension had been lifted with the conclusion of the Treaty on the Final Settlement with respect to Germany of 12 September 1990 (the socalled TwoPlusFour Treaty). As regards the claims for compensation for non-pecuniary damages the court applied a prescription period of three years, holding that the claims had become time-barred in the end of 1993. In respect of their claims of restitution of the unjustified enrichment (Anspruch auf Herausgabe der ungerechtfertigten Bereicherung) the court found that, contrary to the case-law of the Federal Court of Justice (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below), those claims were not time-barred. Instead of applying a prescription period of two or four years as the Federal Court of Justice had done, the Court of Appeal applied a prescription period of thirty years. In its reasoning the court stressed that before the Foundation Law had entered into force the question whether claims for forced labour were time-barred had not been finally settled. Leave to appeal on points of law was refused. The Federal Court of Justice rejected the complaint against the refusal of leave to appeal on points of law. The court stated that the Court of Appeal’s holding that claims of restitution of the unjustified enrichment were not time-barred deviated from the existing case-law of the Federal Court of Justice. However, the court found it unnecessary to rule on that issue because the claims were excluded by the Foundation Law in any event. During the proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court Mr Stasiak died and his widow pursued the proceedings. The Federal Constitutional Court refused to admit the constitutional complaint against the aforementioned decisions and section 16 of the Foundation Law, holding that they did not violate the complainants’ rights under Article 14 of the German Basic Law (right of property). The court found that Article 14 was applicable, because the complainants had had claims for restitution of the unjustified enrichment prior to the Foundation Law’s entry into force, as held by the Court of Appeal; the findings of which were binding as a starting point for the constitutional review insofar the question of prescription was concerned. The Federal Constitutional Court went on to say that although there had been an interference with the complainants’ right of property, it did not constitute an expropriation. It found that the exclusion of claims under the Foundation Law was not undertaken for public purposes (zur Erfüllung öffentlicher Aufgaben). On the contrary, the exclusion of claims was meant to balance the purely private interests of the former forced labourers on the one hand and German industry on the other hand. Therefore, section 16 of the Foundation Law determined the extent of the right of property and its limitations (Inhalts- und Schrankenbestimmung). The court concluded that the Foundation Law was an overall settlement (Gesamtregelung) which had struck a fair balance between those competing interests. The court held that both the creation of a compensation scheme on the one hand and the achievement of legal certainty for German companies and the State on the other hand pursued legitimate interests. The court acknowledged that the amount of compensation under the Foundation’s scheme was in some cases inferior to the claims the former forced labourers had had under German civil law. However, the court pointed out that the overall settlement as set up by the Foundation Law had several advantages that balanced its shortcomings. First, the court noted that the Foundation Law created legal certainty for former forced labourers by replacing their claims against companies which were bankrupt or no longer existed with claims against a foundation endowed with sufficient funds. Moreover, the Federal Constitutional Court highlighted that, before the Foundation Law had entered into force, it had been open whether the Federal Court of Justice would change its case-law regarding the prescription of claims for forced labour. Hence the former forced labourers did not have to bring proceedings before the German courts, which would have entailed considerable financial risks and would have been time-consuming. In this respect the court stressed that all former forced labourers were well advanced in years and that only the Foundation’s compensation scheme guaranteed that they would receive compensation within their lifetime. The decision was served on 4 January 2005. On an unknown date Mr Poznanski, Mr Silberstein, Mr Handwohl and Mrs Stasiak, as her late husband’s heir, were granted payments under the Foundation Law amounting to the equivalent of 7,669 EUR each. On 29 May 2005 Mr Handwohl died. According to the preliminary sixth report of the Federal Ministry of Finances on the activities of the Foundation, which covers its activities until 31 March 2006, about 2,330,000 applications for compensation had been lodged with the Foundation’s partner organisations. In approximately 1,650,000 cases the partner organisations rendered positive decisions, while about 678,000 requests were denied. Approximately six thousand cases were still pending before the partner organisations’ appeals boards. All partner organisations combined had awarded payments amounting to about 4.3 billion EUR. In about 22,400 cases the partner organisations were still in the process of making the payments. According to the judgment of the Federal Court of Justice of 22 June 1967, claims against a company for the restitution of the unjustified enrichment or claims for compensation for non-pecuniary damages for forced labour carried out during the Second World War were time-barred. The court found that tort claims were prescribed after three years, while claims for restitution of the unjustified enrichment became time-barred after either two or four years (no. VII ZR 181/65, Decisions of the Federal Court of Justice in Civil Matters (BGHZ) vol. 48, pp. 125 et seq.). In decisions rendered after the year 2000 several Courts of Appeal held that the statute of limitations for claims relating to forced labour during the Second World War had been suspended (gehemmt) by the London Debt Agreement. That suspension had been lifted with the conclusion of the Treaty on the Final Settlement with respect to Germany of 12 September 1990 (the socalled TwoPlusFour Treaty) because that treaty was considered a final settlement of reparation. However, applying the prescription periods (Verjährungsfristen) as determined by the Federal Court of Justice in its aforementioned judgment, the courts concluded that the claims against the respondent companies had become time-barred before the actions were brought (see the judgment of the Stuttgart Court of Appeal of 20 June 2000, no. 12 U 37/00; the decision of the Court of Appeal of Schleswig-Holstein of 19 January 2001, no. 4 W 47/99; the decision of the Koblenz Court of Appeal of 30 October 2000, no. 10 W 542/00; decision of the Bamberg Court of Appeal of 17 October 2000, no. 3 W 86/00). There has never been a final judgment confirming the existence of claims arising from forced labour carried out during the Second World War. The Foundation Law stipulates that the Foundation should be endowed with 10 billion DEM (5.11 billion EUR), to be provided equally by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany and German companies. The sum of 8.1 billion DEM was intended for the compensation of forced labour. The remaining funds inter alia aimed at compensating the loss of property or were granted as humanitarian aid to the Jewish Claims Conference and the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims which finance social programmes for Holocaust survivors. All German companies which exploited forced labourers during the Second World War are protected by the Foundation Law, regardless of whether they actually contributed to the Foundation. Requests for compensation are not processed by the Foundation itself, but by its regional partner organisations in several European countries. The highest amount of compensation - for forced labour in a concentration camp - is 15,000 DEM (7,669 EUR). That amount can be reduced if the funds do not suffice to fully compensate all individuals entitled under the Foundation Law. The compensation is made in two instalments. First, 35 % or 50 % of the total sum is paid out, while the second instalment is made after all requests have been processed, provided that the funds suffice. As a matter of principle, only the forced labourers themselves are entitled to compensation. Heirs are only eligible if the forced labourer died after 15 February 1999. According to section 16 of the Foundation Law all further claims against the German State or German companies are excluded. That provision reads as follows: “Exclusions from Claims (1) Payments from public funds, including social security, and from German business enterprises for injustice suffered under National Socialism as defined in Section 11 may be claimed only under the terms of this Law. Any further claims in connection with National Socialist injustices are excluded. This applies also to cases in which claims have been transferred to third persons by operation of law, transition, or a legal transaction. (2) On receipt of a payment under this Law, each claimant shall provide a statement ... irrevocably renouncing, without prejudice to Sentences 3 to 5, after receipt of a payment under this Law any further claim against the authorities for forced labour and property damage, all claims against German enterprises in connection with National Socialist injustice, and forced-labour claims against the Republic of Austria or Austrian enterprises. The renunciation becomes effective upon receipt of a payment under this Law. ...”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. In 1991 the applicant lent a certain sum to R.K. On 21 July 1993 he sued his debtor before the Szczecin District Court (Sąd Rejonowy). On 5 October 1993 the court issued a payment order granting the applicant's claim. In December 1993 the bailiff of the Szczecin District Court instituted enforcement proceedings against R.K. The enforcement proceedings are pending. On 17 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”) entered into force. It lays down various legal means designed to counteract and/or redress the undue length of judicial proceedings. Section 2 of the 2004 Act reads, in so far as relevant: “1. Parties Section 5 reads, in so far as relevant: “1. A complaint about the unreasonable length of proceedings shall be lodged while the proceedings are pending. ...” Section 12 provides for measures that may be applied by the court dealing with the complaint. It reads, in so far as relevant: “1. The court shall dismiss a complaint which is unjustified. 2. If the court considers that the complaint is justified, it shall find that there was an unreasonable delay in the impugned proceedings. 3. At the request of the complainant, the court may instruct the court examining the merits of the case to take certain measures within a fixed time-limit. Such instructions shall not concern the factual and legal assessment of the case. 4. If the complaint is justified the court may, at the request of the complainant, grant ... just satisfaction in an amount not exceeding PLN 10,000 to be paid by the State Treasury.

61,001-57526,ENG,GBR,CHAMBER,1986,CASE OF LITHGOW AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,2,No violation of P1-1;No violation of Art. 14+P1-1;No violation of Art. 6-1;No violation of Art. 13,C. Russo,"9. The applicants in the present case had certain of their interests nationalised under the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977 (""the 1977 Act""). Whilst not contesting the principle of the nationalisation as such, they claimed that the compensation which they received was grossly inadequate and discriminatory and alleged that they had been victims of breaches of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the Convention, taken alone and in conjunction with Article 14 (art. 14+P1-1) of the Convention. They also invoked Article 6 (art. 6) and - in one case - Article 13 (art. 13) of the Convention. Certain claims of violation of Articles 17 and 18 (art. 17, art. 18) of the Convention, which had been made before the Commission, were not pursued before the Court. 10. In its election manifesto published on 8 February 1974, the Labour Party stated that its political programme included nationalisation of the United Kingdom aircraft and shipbuilding industries. It had made previous statements to that effect in 1971, 1972 and 1973. At a general election held on 28 February 1974, the Labour Party gained office from the Conservatives and formed a government; it did not then have an overall majority in the House of Commons. On 31 July 1974, the Secretary of State for Industry announced that the shipbuilding and shiprepair industries would be taken into public ownership and that legislative provisions for safeguarding their assets would be effective from that date; details of the Government’s proposals for nationalising those industries were set out in a discussion paper published on the same day. A further general election was held on 10 October 1974, at which the Labour Party was returned with an overall majority. On 29 October, the Queen’s Speech at the opening of Parliament referred to the Government’s intention to bring the aerospace industry into public ownership and a statement concerning safeguarding provisions for its assets was made in the House of Commons on 4 November. On 15 January 1975, the Government published a consultative document relative to their plans for the nationalisation of that industry. 11. The above-mentioned discussion paper and consultative document contained particulars of the companies to be nationalised and stated that ""fair compensation"" would be paid, though without giving details of the compensation terms. Both documents set out the political, economic and social considerations that motivated the nationalisation proposed; essentially, the Government considered that it would put the industries concerned - which had been in receipt of substantial Government assistance and were heavily dependent on Government contracts - on a sounder organisational and economic footing and bring to them a desirably greater degree of public control and accountability. 12. On 17 March 1975, the Secretary of State for Industry announced in the House of Commons the forthcoming introduction of an Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill to give effect to the nationalisation proposals. He indicated, for the first time, the basis on which compensation would be determined, namely by reference to the value of the securities of the companies to be acquired: securities quoted on a recognised Stock Exchange were to be valued at their average price during the six months ending on 28 February 1974, whilst the value of unquoted securities was to be determined, by agreement or arbitration, as if they had been quoted during that period. Details of the safeguarding provisions were also given. 13. A Bill on the lines announced was duly published, providing for the securities of forty-three companies to pass into the ownership of public corporations. Although the Bill received its first reading on 30 April 1975, it lapsed at the end of the Parliamentary session due to lack of time. The Government then reviewed the proposed compensation terms (including the choice of the valuation reference period) in the light of representations received, but decided not to change them, notably on account of the uncertainty which this would have created, of the extent of share dealings that had taken place on the basis of the terms already announced and of the fact that in the alternative reference periods canvassed share prices were likely to have been distorted by the commitment to nationalisation. 14. A second Bill, in essentially the same terms as the first, was introduced in November 1975. It gave rise to protracted proceedings in the House of Commons, covering such matters as the principle and the scope of the nationalisation measure and the compensation terms. In February 1976, the Government themselves announced the exclusion from the ambit of the Bill of Drypool Group Ltd.; this shipbuilding company had become insolvent after February 1974 and the Government considered that it would be unjustifiable to pay its shareholders the full value of the shares during the compensation reference period. Having received its third reading in the House of Commons on 29 July 1976, the Bill passed to the House of Lords where, after further lengthy debates, various amendments were made which were not acceptable to the Government; in particular, certain shiprepairing and warship-building companies were excluded and a provision was inserted whereby the Arbitration Tribunal - which was to assess compensation in default of agreement - would have been able to award ""fair compensation"" if it considered that this would not be provided under the statutory formula. The ensuing disagreement between the two Houses of Parliament over the amendments could not be resolved by the end of the session and the second Bill therefore also lapsed. 15. A third Bill in the same terms as the second was introduced into the House of Commons on 26 November 1976, completed all procedural stages there by 7 December and was then introduced into the House of Lords under a special procedure whereby it could pass into law without the assent of that House. It received the Royal Assent and came into force on 17 March 1977. The compensation terms enacted were essentially identical to those provided for in the first Bill; the same applied to the interests to be nationalised, except for the exclusion of Drypool Group Ltd. and also - following an amendment accepted by the Government during the proceedings on the third Bill - of certain companies whose business consisted solely of shiprepairing. In the final event, thirty-one companies (four aerospace and the remainder shipbuilding, marine engineering or shipbuilding training) were listed for nationalisation in the 1977 Act. 16. The Parliamentary debates were characterised throughout by opposition concentrated, in particular, on the alleged unfairness of the compensation terms. The criticisms - which were substantially identical to those made by the applicants in the present proceedings and were all withdrawn or rejected after debate - related, inter alia, to the use of a hypothetical Stock Exchange method of valuation for unlisted shares; the choice of the valuation reference period; the absence of provision for taking account of growth in the companies concerned, or fall in the value of money, after the reference period; the non-inclusion in the compensation formula of any equivalent of the ""control premium"" (see paragraph 98 below); and the fact that the valuation of certain acquired companies might be related to the stock market quotation of their parent companies’ shares. Government spokesmen, for their part, maintained that the terms were fair. They argued, amongst other things, that it was proper to value securities at a date before they were affected by the possibility of nationalisation; that the subsequent performance of a particular company would normally have been in prospect at the reference period and hence reflected in the imputed share price; that it was reasonable that the Government should benefit from any improvements in the companies after the end of the reference period since they accepted the risk of any deterioration, short of bankruptcy; that it was fallacious to assume that there was a correlation between share values and the rate of inflation; that the choice of reference period protected shareholders against the subsequent fluctuations in market prices; that the terms on which compensation was being offered were not those on which a willing buyer acquired control of a company from a willing seller, since this was not a transaction of that kind but a nationalisation by Act of Parliament; and that regard would be had to the quotation of a parent company’s shares only where the acquired company’s activities constituted a ""very substantial"" part of the whole undertaking. The Government also acknowledged that the settlement of compensation would take some time, but expressed their intention of making payments on account as large and as quickly as possible and within six months of passage of the companies into public ownership. 17. In May 1979 - at which time compensation negotiations were still in progress (see paragraphs 33-35 below) -, a further general election was held and the Conservative Party returned to office. The new Government reviewed, in the light of representations made, the compensations terms contained in the 1977 Act but decided not to change them. In a written answer the new Secretary of State for Industry announced this to the House of Commons on 7 August 1980, in the following terms: ""We recognise that some previous owners and many members of this House and of the public believe that the terms of compensation imposed by the 1977 Act were grossly unfair to some of the companies and we share this view. We have explored every possibility to right the injustice done by the previous Government but to our very great regret we have concluded that amending legislation to establish new compensation terms retrospectively would be unjust to the many people who sold shares on the basis of the previous terms."" The new Government also considered, but decided against, any immediate denationalisation of certain of the companies that had passed into public ownership. 18. Sections 19 and 20 of the 1977 Act provided that, on a date to be specified by the Secretary of State for Industry (""Vesting Day""), the securities of the companies engaged in the aircraft and shipbuilding industries which were listed in Schedules 1 and 2, together with certain other assets appurtenant to their activities, should vest in ""British Aerospace"" or ""British Shipbuilders"", two public corporations established under the Act. The dates subsequently so specified were, for aerospace companies, 29 April 1977 and, for shipbuilding companies, 1 July 1977. The Act also made provision for compensation to be paid to the former holders of securities of the acquired companies, for the safeguarding of the assets of the nationalised undertakings, for the appointment of stockholders’ representatives and for the establishment of an Arbitration Tribunal. 19. Under section 35(3), the amount of compensation payable was, generally, an amount equal to the ""base value"" of the nationalised securities, less any deduction which was appropriate by virtue of section 39 (see paragraphs 23-24 below). For securities listed on the London Stock Exchange, the ""base value"" was, under section 37(1), the average of their weekly quotations during the six months between 1 September 1973 and 28 February 1974 (""the Reference Period"", the second date being that of the general election referred to in paragraph 10, second sub-paragraph, above). For securities not so listed and issued before the end of the Reference Period, the ""base value"" was ""such as may be determined by agreement between the Secretary of State and the stockholders’ representative"" (see paragraph 28 below) ""or, in default of such agreement, as may be determined by arbitration under this Act to be the base value which the securities would have had under section 37 ... if they had been listed"" on the Stock Exchange throughout the Reference Period (section 38(1)). The ""base value"" of unlisted securities issued after the end of the Reference Period was, generally, their issue price (section 38(10)). Among the reasons given by the Government for the choice of this reference period were: the need to avoid a period when the value of the shares was distorted by the prospect of nationalisation; subject to this, the need to take as recent a period as possible; and the general decline in share prices between mid-1972 and March 1975, when the compensation terms were announced, making it desirable to choose a period reflecting the mid-point of the share market over those years. In determining the ""base value"" of unlisted securities, the Arbitration Tribunal (see paragraphs 29-32 below) was to have regard to ""all relevant factors""; when the acquired company was the subsidiary of a company all or part of whose shares were listed on the Stock Exchange and carried on an undertaking which ""formed a substantial part of the undertakings of the group of companies of which the company and the parent company were members"", one of those factors was the stock market quotation of the parent company’s shares (section 38(3) and (6)). During negotiations, the Secretary of State, whilst having some scope for judgment, could not offer by way of compensation more than was possible under the statutory formula. The Arbitration Tribunal, for its part, was in no way bound by the amount offered or contended for in negotiations. In determining compensation, no regard was had to any grants to the nationalised undertakings from public funds. 20. Under section 36, compensation was not payable until the ""base value"" of the nationalised shares and the amount of any deduction to be made under section 39 (see paragraphs 23-24 below) had been determined. However, it was provided that, at any time after Vesting Day, ""such sum may be paid on account of compensation ... as the Secretary of State thinks fit ..."". The payments on account made to the applicants in the present case were unconditional. 21. (a) Compensation was to take the form of government stock, known as ""Compensation Stock"" (section 35(1)). Interest thereon was to accrue from Vesting Day (Schedule 5). The rate of such interest was to be determined by the Treasury, as were the conditions as to repayment, redemption and other matters (section 40). (b) Compensation was not subject to tax on receipt, but disposal or redemption of Compensation Stock gave rise to liability to capital gains tax, the gain being calculated by reference to the cost of acquisition by the shareholder of the nationalised shares. However, by virtue of section 54 of the Finance Act 1976, the replacement of Compensation Stock by new business assets could give rise to an entitlement to ""roll-over relief"", whereby liability to tax would be deferred until the new assets, or their successors, were ultimately disposed of. Such relief was available only where the recipient of the Compensation Stock was a company and where the nationalised concern had been either a subsidiary, at least 75% owned, of that company or a wholly-owned subsidiary of a consortium consisting of five or fewer companies; it could not be claimed by a private individual, regardless of the size of his shareholding in the nationalised concern. These criteria were intended to limit the ambit of ""roll-over relief"" to cases where the shares in the nationalised company had been held as a business asset rather than as a purely financial investment. 22. During the course of the Parliamentary proceedings on the various Bills, Government spokesmen stated that the undertakings to be nationalised were to continue to operate as normal commercial concerns until Vesting Day. And, in fact, all the companies with which the present case is concerned did so. Although the undertakings remained private property until Vesting Day, the 1977 Act contained a number of safeguarding provisions whose general aim was to ensure that, between the end of the Reference Period (28 February 1974) and that Day, there was no abnormal action by the existing owners or management which might be detrimental to the public sector. The provisions, whose broad effect is summarised below, did not apply if the action in question had been approved by the Secretary of State for Industry; retroactive approval was possible in certain circumstances, notably in respect of ""material transactions"" (see paragraph 24 below). The Government gave assurances that the safeguarding provisions would not be used in such a way as to penalise reasonable action taken in the normal course of business and in good faith. 23. Holders of securities of the acquired companies were entitled to dividends and interest thereon for all periods up to Vesting Day. However, limits were in effect imposed on the amount of dividends and interest paid pursuant to resolutions passed between the end of the Reference Period and Vesting Day: if the date of the resolution lay between 28 February 1974 and the ""Safeguarding Date"" (generally 17 March 1975, being the date of the statement in Parliament outlining the compensation terms and safeguarding provisions; see paragraph 12 above), the amount of any payments in excess of the permissible maximum fell, under section 39, to be deducted from the compensation payable for shares under section 35; if the date of the resolution was after the Safeguarding Date and before Vesting Day, the directors of the acquired company were personally liable to the relevant public corporation for any such excess (section 23). For a dividend, the permissible maximum was generally either the net revenue of the company for the period in respect of which the dividend was declared or the amount of the most recent ordinary dividend previously paid (whichever was the less); for interest, it was the minimum necessary to avoid default on obligations or the carrying over of interest for subsequent payment (section 24). During the Parliamentary debates, the Government gave assurances that higher payments would be authorised if the circumstances warranted. 24. British Aerospace and British Shipbuilders were protected against losses occasioned by ""material"" or ""onerous"" transactions entered into by an acquired company between the end of the Reference Period and Vesting Day. Broadly speaking, a ""material transaction"" was one, such as a special dividend, that involved the direct or indirect transfer of company assets to shareholders and an ""onerous transaction"" was one that was unusual or unreasonable and foreseeably caused loss to the company (sections 30 and 31). If the transaction had been entered into between 28 February 1974 and the Safeguarding Date - or in certain cases the ""Initial Date"" (31 July 1974 for the shipbuilding industry or 4 November 1974 for the aerospace industry) -, the net loss caused thereby to the relevant public corporation fell, under section 39, to be deducted from the compensation payable for shares under section 35; if the transaction had been entered into after the Safeguarding Date - or the Initial Date - and before Vesting Day, that corporation could institute proceedings before the Arbitration Tribunal (see paragraphs 29-32 below) to recover from the directors or the parties to the transaction the loss caused thereby and, in the case of an ""onerous transaction"", to have the same declared void (sections 30 and 31). 25. There was also a general prohibition on the transfer away by an acquired company of certain assets, coupled with the possibility for the relevant public corporation to institute proceedings before the Arbitration Tribunal to have the damage suffered as a result of the transfer made good by the directors or the parties thereto (section 28). If the transfer had been effected after the Initial Date, the corporation could recover the assets, either by acquiring certain additional companies or by acquiring the assets themselves (sections 26 and 29). 26. The Secretary of State could in certain circumstances (notably insolvency) remove a company from the list of companies to be nationalised (section 27). 27. Questions arising as to the amount of the appropriate deduction to be made from compensation under section 39 were to be determined by agreement between the Secretary of State and the Stockholders’ Representative (see paragraph 28 below) or, in default of such agreement, by the Arbitration Tribunal. The latter also had jurisdiction over various other issues arising under the safeguarding provisions. 28. Section 41(1) of the 1977 Act provided that a Stockholders’ Representative was to be appointed in respect of each acquired company ""to represent the interests of holders of securities of that company in connection with the determination of the base value of those securities"". He was to be appointed by the holders of the securities at a meeting held within a prescribed time-limit, failing which, by the Secretary of State; he could be removed by resolution passed at a meeting of the security holders (Schedule 6). His remuneration and expenses were to be met by the Secretary of State. The raison d’être for the institution of Stockholders’ Representative was that it was considered essential, in order to prevent negotiations and arbitration being rendered unworkable by a multiplicity of individual claims, that they be conducted, on behalf of the former owners, exclusively by a nominee representing their collective interests. As a result, although the individual shareholders had voting rights at stockholders’ meetings, they had no direct standing in compensation negotiations. According to Sir William Lithgow, the Representative was not obliged to seek the stockholders’ consent before agreeing to compensation in negotiations or to refer the question of compensation to arbitration if so requested by them; in this applicant’s view, a stockholder had, in practice, no means of ensuring that the Representative complied with his wishes, save for the aforesaid possibility of removal. According to the Government, stockholders would have had a remedy in the domestic courts against a Representative for failure to comply either with his obligations under the 1977 Act or with his common-law obligations as agent. They further maintained that he could not refuse to institute arbitration proceedings if so directed by the stockholders or, probably, a majority of them and that, as a matter of pure practice, he would not agree the quantum of compensation in negotiations without their consent. 29. Section 42 of the 1977 Act established the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Arbitration Tribunal. For the hearing of any proceedings, the Tribunal was to consist of a legally-qualified president (appointed by the Lord Chancellor or, in the case of Scottish proceedings, the Lord President of the Court of Session) and two other members (appointed by the Secretary of State after consultation with all the Stockholders’ Representatives), one being of experience in business and the other in finance. Criteria for the selection of members of the Tribunal - relating to their standing and experience and including a requirement that they should not have any connection with the companies nationalised - were worked out in consultation with the Stockholders’ Representatives, who were also invited to make proposals as to suitable members. Members of the Tribunal were to hold office ""for such period as may be determined at the time of their respective appointments"". The appointor of a member could declare his office vacant ""on the ground that he is unfit to continue in his office"" but, by virtue of section 8(1) of the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1971, this power was exercisable only with the consent of the Lord Chancellor or the Lord President of the Court of Session. Provision was also made for resignation, vacation of office on grounds of bankruptcy or replacement in case of illness. 30. The Tribunal’s jurisdiction was limited to the issues specified in the 1977 Act; these included various claims and questions arising under the safeguarding provisions and, in the context of compensation, determination of the ""base value"" referred to in section 38(1) and of the deductions to be made therefrom under section 39 (see paragraphs 19 and 23-24 above). In assessing the ""base value"", the Tribunal could hear argument about the weight to be attached to any relevant factor, but not about the alleged unfairness of the statutory formula, by which it was bound. The jurisdiction in relation to ""base value"" and deductions arose only ""in default of agreement"" between the Secretary of State and the Stockholders’ Representative, but the latter was free to refer the question of compensation to the Tribunal at any moment after Vesting Day. In the view of the Government - which was contested by Sir William Lithgow -, there was no legal bar to access to the Tribunal by an individual shareholder, unless and until agreement had been reached in negotiations. Thereafter, he could not seise the Tribunal even if he considered that the sum agreed was too small under the statutory formula. 31. The procedure before the Tribunal was governed by The Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Arbitration Tribunal Rules 1977 and The Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Arbitration Tribunal (Scottish Proceedings) Rules 1977, made by the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Advocate, respectively. These statutory instruments provided for proceedings similar to those of a court; in particular, hearings were generally to be held in public. 32. An appeal on any question of law - but not on the quantum of compensation - lay from the Tribunal to the Court of Appeal in England or the Court of Session in Scotland and thereafter, with leave, to the House of Lords (Schedule 7). Furthermore, a Stockholders’ Representative could, according to the Government, test in the ordinary courts whether the Secretary of State, in formulating a compensation offer, had erred in law by misinterpreting or misapplying the 1977 Act. 33. On the passing of the 1977 Act, Messrs. Whinney Murray & Co., a leading firm of chartered accountants appointed by the Government to advise them in the compensation procedures, set about valuing the companies concerned by issuing a questionnaire to all of them. According to the Government, it was not possible to seek the cooperation of the companies or their shareholders at an earlier date because there was no certainty as to when or in what form the strongly contested legislation would be passed. 34. Compensation for those shares in the acquired companies which were listed on the Stock Exchange was agreed before, and paid on, 1 July 1977, the relevant Vesting Day. As regards the remaining, unquoted, shares, Messrs. Whinney Murray & Co. provided the Department of Industry with preliminary valuations on most of the companies during January 1978 and on the remainder during April 1978, for the purpose of calculating payments on account of compensation which were made during those months. On various dates between December 1977 and May 1978, the accountants supplied the Department with full valuation reports, factual information wherefrom was sent for comment to the company concerned and to the Stockholders’ Representative acting on behalf of the holders of its securities (see paragraph 28 above). The Department and the Representatives exchanged memoranda on various dates between March and October 1978 and negotiations between them followed. Further payments on account of compensation were announced in July and November 1978 and, in some cases, in 1979. 35. Between July 1978 and 7 August 1980 (being the date of the new Government’s announcement that they had decided not to change the compensation terms; see paragraph 17 above), various settlements were reached but, with the exception of the Kincaid case (see paragraphs 40-45 below), none of them related to the acquired companies with which the present proceedings are concerned. Shortly after the aforesaid announcement, the Minister of State indicated in a series of meetings with Stockholders’ Representatives that, within the confines of the statutory formula, the Department of Industry would be prepared to settle the remaining cases at amounts somewhat beyond those already offered in negotiations. Settlements regarding the other companies with which the present proceedings are concerned were reached by the end of 1980. 36. In the compensation negotiations the Department of Industry and their advisers used the following four methods of arriving at a hypothetical Stock Exchange quotation for unlisted shares. (a) For most of the profitable companies an earnings-based valuation was applied. This method, which involved considering the company’s historic and prospective post-tax earnings (as at the Reference Period) and applying thereto an appropriate multiplier (price/earnings ratio) assessed by comparison with listed companies, was used in all the cases with which the present proceedings are concerned, other than the Vosper Thornycroft and the Yarrow Shipbuilders cases (see paragraphs 46-53 and 70-75 below). Since stock market quotations are not dependent solely on earnings, the Government’s accountants, in preparing their valuations, reviewed, where appropriate, the figure arrived at by the above method against the criteria of asset-backing and dividend yield. (b) Where the acquired company was a subsidiary carrying on the main part of the total undertaking of a company all or part of whose shares were listed on the Stock Exchange, a parent-company-related valuation was employed, in view of section 38(6) of the 1977 Act (see paragraph 19 above). This method, which involved deducting from the parent company’s average capitalisation during the Reference Period a valuation for the non-vesting elements in the group, or apportioning the capitalisation according to the contribution to group earnings of the vesting and the non-vesting elements, was used in the Vosper Thornycroft and the Yarrow Shipbuilders cases. (c) In certain other cases, where the company acquired was not making a profit, recourse was had to an assets-based valuation, based on the hypothesis of an open-market sale of the assets during the Reference Period. (d) One other unprofitable company was valued by a share-capital-related method that is at a discount to the nominal value of its issued share capital. 37. The present proceedings arise from the nationalisation under the 1977 Act of the seven undertakings described below. Save for the preference shares in Kincaid (see paragraph 40 below), none of the shares in the companies concerned was listed on the Stock Exchange, so that, with that exception, compensation fell to be assessed on the basis of a hypothetical Stock Exchange quotation (see paragraph 19 above). 38. The descriptions of the seven undertakings include particulars of profits and assets which, except where otherwise stated, are taken from the company’s audited accounts. Pre-tax profits have been shown as the post-tax figures are not in the Court’s possession in every case. Figures for net assets do not include amounts in respect of deferred taxation and for this reason differ from the figures appearing in the Commission’s report. References to cash in hand or equivalent are to gross amounts, that is without taking account of any outstanding liabilities. 39. Reference is also made below to various estimates submitted by the applicants, both to the Commission and to the Court, concerning the value of their nationalised interests. This material was not generally challenged or commented on by the Government. This was not because they accepted it as correct, but because they considered that it was inappropriate to do so since those estimates did not reflect the statutory formula, which formula, in their view, was consistent with the requirements of the Convention. 40. On 1 July 1977, there vested in British Shipbuilders the preference and the ordinary shares in John G. Kincaid & Company Ltd. (""Kincaid""), which manufactured marine diesel engines at Greenock. The preference shares were listed on the Stock Exchange and no complaint was made in the present proceedings regarding the compensation received therefor. Sir William Lithgow, who is a shipbuilder by profession and was the largest single shareholder in the company, owned 186,320 - or slightly over 28% - of its 662,500 issued ordinary shares. 41. (a) Kincaid’s pre-tax profits for the following years, ending on 31 December, were: 1971 - £860,000 1972 - £595,000 1973 - £387,000 1974 - £1,258,000 1975 - £1,740,000 1976 - £1,356,000. In the half-year to 30 June 1977, the pre-tax profits were, according to the Commission’s report, approximately £700,000. Kincaid had no Government orders and required no special Government subsidies. From 1974 to Vesting Day a total of £513,000 was paid in dividends on the ordinary shares; according to Sir William Lithgow, Government- imposed dividend restraint resulted in £1,953,000 being added to company funds between the Reference Period and Vesting Day. (b) Kincaid’s net assets were: at 31 December 1972 - £3,679,530 at 31 December 1973 - £3,723,528 at 30 June 1977 - £5,988,096. At the hearings before the Court, Sir William Lithgow declared that Kincaid had cash reserves of £5.058 million at 30 June 1977. 42. Sir William Lithgow, however, stated that during the Reference Period Kincaid had net assets of approximately £9,500,000 and he supplied a valuation, prepared after the proceedings before the Commission, indicating that the value of the company at 28 February 1974, calculated in accordance with the 1977 Act on the basis of a hypothetical Stock Exchange quotation, was in the region of £8,750,000 to £10,250,000. He further estimated that the net assets attributable to ordinary shareholders as at Vesting Day were worth at least £18,000,000. All these various figures took account of revaluations of the company’s premises and plant, effected by a firm of chartered surveyors, indicating that they were worth substantially more than the amounts shown in the balance sheet. The cash reserves at 30 June 1977 were described by Sir William Lithgow as surplus to Kincaid’s requirements. 43. Messrs. Whinney Murray & Co.’s valuation report on Kincaid - suggesting a figure in the range of £3,000,000 to £3,300,000 - was submitted to the Department of Industry in February 1978; it was based on earnings (see paragraph 36 (a) above). The report took no account of a revaluation of fixed assets, effected after the end of the Reference Period. Memoranda were exchanged between the Department and the Stockholders’ Representative in August 1978 and formal negotiations then began. The Department offered £2,750,000 and the Representative claimed £5,500,000. Subsequent discussions focused in particular on the question whether a different accounting treatment would have been followed had Kincaid’s ordinary shares been listed on the Stock Exchange. By February 1979, the gap between the parties had narrowed (£3,500,000 being offered by the Department and £4,700,000 claimed by the Representative) and, after further negotiation, agreement was reached, subject to the former shareholders’ approval, at a figure of £3,809,375. 44. After the Stockholders’ Representative had recommended acceptance of this figure, a meeting of the shareholders was held on 21 November 1979 to consider a resolution approving the agreement. Sir William Lithgow and eight other stockholders were present but he abstained from voting, as he considered that the information available about the settlement was insufficient and that the figure did not represent Kincaid’s value during the Reference Period or at Vesting Day. All the votes cast were in favour and the resolution was thus carried. The Stockholders’ Representative ratified the settlement on the following day and on 4 December 1979 British Shipbuilders issued a notice to all the former shareholders, informing them of the agreed compensation. 45. Compensation payments in respect of Kincaid’s ordinary shares were made as follows: - in January 1978, a first payment on account (section 36(6) of the 1977 Act; see paragraph 20 above), of £1,450,000; - in November 1978, a second payment on account, of £800,000; - shortly after the settlement in November 1979, the final payment, of £1,559,375. All these payments were effected by the issue of 9 3/4 % Treasury Stock 1981, bearing a running yield of about 10% per annum. The total compensation received by Sir William Lithgow for his ordinary shares was £1,071,340. He stated that he sustained on this sum, which he expended on trading assets, a liability to capital gains tax of £207,752. 46. On 1 July 1977, there vested in British Shipbuilders the shares in Vosper Thornycroft (UK) Ltd. and Vosper Shiprepairers Ltd. (hereinafter together referred to as ""Vosper Thornycroft""), which were primarily engaged in naval shipbuilding and also operated a shiprepair business. Both of these companies were wholly-owned subsidiaries of Vosper and their activities formed a substantial part of the latter’s business. The shares of Vosper were listed on the Stock Exchange, but it was nevertheless a tightly-controlled subsidiary of a private unlisted company, David Brown Holdings Ltd. Various organisational changes had taken place in the Vosper Group between 1974 and 1977. In brief, its trading activities, which had previously been carried on mainly by one subsidiary company, were first transferred to the parent company and then, on 15 March 1977, transferred back to two subsidiaries, one - Vosper Thornycroft (UK) Ltd. - dealing with shipbuilding and the other - Vosper Shiprepairers Ltd. - with shiprepair. The second transfer had the object (which was not fulfilled) of avoiding nationalisation of the shiprepair business. 47. (a) The pre-tax profits of Vosper Thornycroft, or its predecessors, for the following years, ending on 31 October, were: 1971 - £622,000 1972 - £1,321,000 1973 - £1,658,000 1974 - £3,262,000 1975 - £4,059,000 1976 - £5,536,000. According to the Commission’s report, in the part-year to 30 June 1977, the pre-tax profits were £5,236,000, giving an annual pre-tax profit rate at Vesting Day of £7,850,000. Between 1972 and 1974, Vosper Thornycroft received £2,108,000 by way of Government shipbuilding grants. Vosper Thornycroft obtained a substantial amount of business from the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence; however, according to the valuation report referred to in the following paragraph, during the period 1971-1976 United Kingdom Government contracts contributed only 17% of profits, 83% being contributed by exports and other business, and exports amounting to 64% of turnover. (b) According to the Commission’s report, the net assets of Vosper Thornycroft, as appearing from the accounts, were £5,857,000 as at 31 October 1972 and £25,633,000 as at 30 June 1977. At the hearings before the Court, Vosper stated that Vosper Thornycroft’s net assets at Vesting Day included £5,500,000 in cash. (c) The average market capitalisation of Vosper’s ordinary shares during the Reference Period was £4,500,000; on 30 June 1977, the capitalisation was £5,800,000. 48. Vosper has submitted a valuation report on Vosper Thornycroft, prepared by a chartered accountant who was also the Stockholders’ Representative in this case and made on the hypothesis of an open-market sale of the business as a going concern on Vesting Day by a willing seller to a single willing buyer. The report analysed Vosper Thornycroft’s profit record, assets, liabilities, cash flow and future prospects and concluded that its value as at Vesting Day was £37,700,000. This figure was reached by estimating the maintainable post-tax profit level and applying thereto a price/earnings multiplier, adjusted to take account of the ""control premium"" (see paragraph 98 below); the adjustment was lower than average as it was considered that the number of potential purchasers would have been limited. During the compensation negotiations, the Stockholders’ Representative prepared another valuation, based this time on the hypothesis that the shares of Vosper Thornycroft had been the subject of a public offer for sale on Vesting Day, which resulted in a figure of £35,400,000. The valuation made allowance for the fact that shares offered for sale to the public would be offered at a price below that at which it was estimated they would stand if already listed on the Stock Exchange. 49. Messrs. Whinney Murray & Co.’s valuation report on Vosper Thornycroft - suggesting a figure in the range of £4,200,000 to £4,600,000, subject to deductions of £1,139,200 under section 39 of the 1977 Act - was submitted to the Department of Industry in December 1977; for the reasons indicated in paragraph 36 (b) above, it was based on the stock market capitalisation of Vosper, the parent company, during the Reference Period. In March 1978, they made a further report to the Department, concerning the group reorganisations, and in June 1978 memoranda were exchanged between the Department and the Stockholders’ Representative. The Department indicated in their memorandum that they valued Vosper Thornycroft at £3,757,000, without taking into account deductions which they considered fell to be made under section 39 in respect of dividends paid for the year 1973-1974 in excess of the permissible maximum and in respect of the 1976-1977 group reorganisation, which was alleged to constitute a ""material transaction"" (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above). In view of the uncertainty as to the amount of the deductions, they deferred making an offer of compensation. The Stockholders’ Representative, in his memorandum, claimed compensation of £35,400,000, based on a Vesting Day valuation of the shares. 50. Four negotiating meetings were held between July 1978 and March 1979. The amount of the deduction for the excessive dividend was agreed and the Department of Industry agreed to forego, in the context of a negotiated settlement, the claim for a deduction arising out of the reorganisation. On this basis, they made, on 1 March 1979, their first formal offer of compensation, in the sum of £3,500,000 net of deductions. 51. Following the general election of May 1979 (see paragraph 17 above) and after representations had been made to the new Government, the Department of Industry made, in September 1979, a revised offer of £4,500,000. Further representations and preparation for arbitration ensued. At a meeting in August 1980, the Minister of State at the Department increased the offer to £4,800,000 net of deductions and indicated that a further 10% increase might be possible. At a further meeting on 17 September 1980, the Stockholders’ Representative - who had apparently previously made his case primarily on the basis that compensation should be based on Vesting Day value - indicated for the first time his view of a Reference Period valuation, on the basis of the statutory formula. He gave a figure of £10,000,000 and indicated that he would expect the Arbitration Tribunal to award around £6,000,000. The Minister of State finally agreed at the meeting to raise the Government’s offer to £5,300,000, but no further. 52. On 19 September 1980, the Stockholders’ Representative wrote to the Minister of State: he regretted the Government’s decision not to offer more or to alter the statutory compensation terms despite their acknowledgement that they were grossly unfair, but he recognised that the final offer was the maximum likely to be recovered by arbitration. To mitigate the effects of further delay, he was prepared to recommend acceptance of the offer. On 7 October 1980, Vosper authorised him to accept it. 53. Compensation payments in respect of Vosper Thornycroft’s shares were made as follows: - in April 1978, a first payment on account, of £650,000; - in November 1978, a second payment on account, of £700,000; - shortly after the settlement in October 1980, the final payment, of £3,950,000. The payments on account were effected by the issue of 9 3/4% Treasury Stock 1981, with a running yield of about 10% per annum, and the final payment, by the issue of 10% Exchequer Stock 1983, with a running yield of slightly under 11%. 54. On 29 April 1977, there vested in British Aerospace the shares in British Aircraft Corporation (Holdings) Ltd. (""BAC""), which was the major aerospace manufacturer in the United Kingdom. Half of its shares were owned by English Electric, a wholly-owned subsidiary of The General Electric Company PLC (""GEC""), and half by Vickers. The shares of GEC and Vickers are quoted on the Stock Exchange, but the activities of BAC did not constitute a substantial part of the latter’s undertaking. BAC was not itself listed in the 1977 Act as one of the companies to be nationalised but it was taken into public ownership - in the place of a subsidiary, British Aircraft Corporation Ltd., that was so listed - on the ground that it owned certain works that had previously belonged to that subsidiary (sections 26 and 27; see paragraphs 25 and 26 above). 55. (a) BAC’s pre-tax profits for the following years, ending on 31 December, were: 1972 - £ 6,571,000 1973 - £13,742,000 1974 - £24,207,000 1975 - £30,003,000 1976 - £39,912,000 1977 - £53,644,000. BAC received no special Government subsidies. Over 70% of its 1977 production was exported. (b) BAC’s net assets were £32.4 million at the end of 1972, £75,620,000 at the end of 1976 and £80,575,000 at the end of 1977. At the hearings before the Court, the former owners of BAC said that it had cash in hand of £57.8 million at the end of 1976 and of £98.7 million at the end of 1977. 56. English Electric and Vickers stated that BAC was one of the most successful companies of the 1970’s in the United Kingdom. They pointed, for example, to the growth in sales, profits, assets and order books between 1973 and 1977 and to future prospects, and asserted that a company with such earnings growth would have commanded on the Stock Exchange a substantial price/earnings ratio and a market value considerably over net asset value. They submitted a valuation indicating that BAC’s value as at Vesting Day was at least £275,000,000 and that this figure should be increased by not less than 30% to take account of the ""control premium"" (see paragraph 98 below), giving an overall value of at least £350,000,000. 57. Negotiations in this case were marked throughout by a basic difference of approach between the Stockholders’ Representative and the Department of Industry. The Representative adopted the ""discretionary approach"", according to which the Secretary of State had a discretion as to the amount of compensation he could agree in negotiations, the statutory compensation formula being binding only on the Arbitration Tribunal; on this basis, the Reference Period was not relevant to the negotiations and compensation could and should be based on market value at Vesting Day. The Department, on the other hand, adopted the ""statutory approach"", according to which negotiations could be conducted only in terms of the statutory formula; on this basis, negotiated compensation would be related to the value which BAC’s shares would have had if they had been quoted during the Reference Period and the performance of the company thereafter was irrelevant save in so far as it could have been foreseen by a prudent investor. 58. On 15 April 1977, the Stockholders’ Representative indicated to the Department of Industry, as a preliminary view, that on the basis of the 1976 profits, BAC’s capitalisation in the stock market would be likely to be in the region of £150,000,000 to £165,000,000, excluding any ""control premium"" which would take the figure up to at least £200,000,000. On 15 August 1977, he revised this figure to £250,000,000. There followed correspondence in which Department and Representative argued, respectively, for the ""statutory approach"" and the ""discretionary approach"". The Department added that it was the large amount of detailed work needed to reach a reasoned view on the base value of the shares at the Reference Period that was holding up the opening of negotiations. 59. Messrs. Whinney Murray & Co.’s valuation report on BAC - suggesting a figure in the range of £31,000,000 to £35,000,000, subject to deductions of £13,736,000 under section 39 of the 1977 Act - was submitted to the Department of Industry in January 1978; it was based on earnings (see paragraph 36 (a) above). On 25 January 1978, the Government announced a first payment on account of compensation, in the sum of £6,100,000; GEC and Vickers issued a joint statement in which, basically, they objected to the small size of the payment. After receiving the factual part of the valuation report, the Stockholders’ Representative wrote, on 9 February 1978, to the Department saying that, attempting to arrive at a figure which was ""fair and reasonable in all the circumstances"" and having regard, inter alia, to profit trend, growth in order books, exports and cash flow, he assessed the value of BAC at £255,100,000, a figure which would have to be substantially higher to take account of any ""control premium"". In May 1978, the Department sent to the Stockholders’ Representative a memorandum indicating that in their view the appropriate method of valuation was by a capitalisation, through the application of an appropriate price/earnings ratio, of the post-tax earnings for the year ending on 31 December 1972 (namely £3,300,000); from the base value thus established deductions fell to be made, under section 39 of the 1977 Act (see paragraphs 23-24 above), in respect of certain dividends paid in 1974. The memorandum did not contain any offer of compensation because, according to the Government, the ""discretionary approach"", for which the Stockholders’ Representative continued to argue in intervening correspondence, was not within the terms of the Act. Maintaining that approach, the Representative gave to the Department on 6 July 1978 a report with his estimate of a stock market valuation of BAC on Vesting Day, namely £275,000,000. According to English Electric and Vickers, a representative of the Department accepted that they would probably have arrived at a similar figure if they were attempting a Vesting Day stock market valuation and stated that BAC’s growth from 1973 to 1977 had been ""spectacular"". However, the Department reaffirmed that, on the basis of legal advice, they could only negotiate on the ""statutory approach"". 60. On 7 August 1978, the Stockholders’ Representative, without renouncing the ""discretionary approach"", wrote to the Department with his view of the hypothetical stock market value of BAC in 1974. This was that a figure of £255,000,000 would have given a prospective dividend yield of just under 4%, dividend cover of 1.7 times and a prospective price/earnings ratio of just over 20, figures which would not have been abnormal for a share with the growth rate of BAC. He added that at £200,000,000 the shares would have been very reasonably valued. There were then discussions as to whether BAC’s profits after the Reference Period had been predictable. On 29 September 1978, the Stockholders’ Representative said that cutting valuation during the Reference Period to the bone would still leave a figure of £175,000,000. The Department accepted that the 1973 earnings could be used as a base for estimating what prospective earnings would have been during the Reference Period. 61. On 16 November 1978, the Department of Industry made a preliminary offer of some £51,000,000, after deduction under section 39 of the 1977 Act of £19,700,000 relating to dividends totalling £31,810,000 paid by BAC in respect of the years 1973 to 1976, primarily a special dividend of £15,000,000 paid in February 1974 out of reserves and deemed to be a ""material transaction"" under section 30 (see paragraph 24 above). They indicated that if the matter went to arbitration, they would argue that £51,000,000 was the appropriate valuation. In December 1978, however, they offered £81,000,000 and in March 1979 the Stockholders’ Representative indicated that £127,000,000 would be acceptable as a compromise. 62. After the general election of May 1979 (see paragraph 17 above), there were further discussions. In September 1979, the Department indicated that, in the context of a negotiated settlement, it might be possible to reduce the section 39 deduction to £15,000,000 and that they could increase their offer to £85,000,000. The Stockholders’ Representative indicated that £115,000,000 would be an acceptable compromise. In November 1979, however, he submitted a memorandum in which he reverted to the ""discretionary approach"". He added that the stockholders’ merchant bankers had unequivocally advised that ""the ‘base value’ of BAC’s securities during the ‘relevant’ period, calculated as if by an arbitrator under the Act, would be at least £140,000,000"". He also argued that the Department, in their restriction of dividend distributions during the period from 1974 to Vesting Day, had gone beyond what was necessary or prudent; there was therefore justification for retroactive approval by the Secretary of State of the 1974 special dividend, so that it would not be deductible from compensation (see paragraphs 22-24 above). This request did not meet with a favourable response and, in the final event, £19,700,000 was deducted under section 39. 63. After further correspondence and discussion, the Department, in August 1980, made a final offer of £95,000,000, net of deductions. On 18 August 1980, the Stockholders’ Representative stated that he was prepared to recommend acceptance and agreement at the figure in question was duly reached. 64. Compensation payments in respect of BAC’s shares were made as follows: - on 10 February 1978, a first payment on account, of £6,100,000; - on 2 August 1978, a second payment on account, of £3,550,000; - on 5 December 1978, a third payment on account, of £30,350,000; - on 28 August 1980, the final payment, of £55,000,000. The payments on account were effected by the issue of 9 3/4% Treasury Stock 1981, carrying a running yield of about 10% per annum, and the final payment, by the issue of 10% Exchequer Stock 1983, carrying a running yield of about 11%. 65. On 1 July 1977, there vested in British Shipbuilders the shares in Hall Russell & Company Ltd. (""Hall Russell""), a limited company registered in Scotland, which carried on a shipbuilding and shiprepair business in Aberdeen and was wholly-owned by Banstonian, an unlimited company. Banstonian was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northern Shipbuilding, of which there were in turn four shareholders. 66. (a) Hall Russell’s pre-tax profits for the following years, ending on 31 March, were, according to the Commission’s report: 1972 - £425,000 1973 - £480,000 1974 - £151,000 1975 - £177,000 1976 - £498,000 1977 - £825,000. In the three months to 30 June 1977, pre-tax profits were £292,374. Between 1973 and 1975, Hall Russell received £657,000 by way of Government shipbuilding grants. (b) Hall Russell’s net assets were £1,358,000 as at 31 March 1973 and £1,622,573 as at 30 June 1977. In their memorial filed with the Court, the former owners of Hall Russell said that it had £3,355,000 available in cash on Vesting Day. 67. Banstonian and Northern Shipbuilding stated that Hall Russell was a sound, successful and growing undertaking and that this was confirmed by its results after nationalisation. By reference to a valuation report, prepared in October 1978 for the purposes of the compensation negotiations and taking into account the earnings record, the value of the net tangible assets and the dividend yield, they submitted that if Hall Russell had been valued as at Vesting Day, they should have received compensation of £3,500,000. 68. Messrs. Whinney Murray & Co.’s valuation report on Hall Russell - suggesting a figure in the range of £900,000 to £1,000,000 - was submitted to the Department of Industry in March 1978; it was based on earnings (see paragraph 36 (a) above). In October 1978, memoranda on the valuation were exchanged between the Department and the Stockholders’ Representative. The former offered £800,000. The latter maintained that section 38 of the 1977 Act (see paragraph 19 above) gave the Secretary of State a discretion in settling compensation, and that the only fair basis was value at Vesting Day, namely £3,500,000. In November 1978, the Stockholders’ Representative put forward a Reference Period valuation of £2,500,000 - £3,000,000. In March 1979, the Government offered £1,000,000. This offer was subsequently increased to £1,500,000 and settlement at that figure was concluded in November 1980. 69. Compensation payments in respect of Hall Russell’s shares were made as follows: - on 7 February 1978, a first payment on account, of £300,000; - on 1 August 1978, a second payment on account, of £100,000; - on 5 December 1978, a third payment on account, of £250,000; - on 21 November 1980, the final payment, of £850,000. The payments on account were effected by the issue of 9 3/4 % Treasury Stock 1981, carrying a running yield of about 10% per annum, and the final payment, by the issue of 10% Exchequer Stock 1983, carrying a running yield of slightly under 11%. 70. On 1 July 1977, there vested in British Shipbuilders the shares in Yarrow (Shipbuilders) Ltd. (""Yarrow Shipbuilders""), which was engaged in building in Glasgow warships and other specialist vessels. This company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yarrow, whose shares were listed on the Stock Exchange, and its activities comprised a substantial part of the latter’s business. In 1968, Yarrow, which had previously owned all the shares in Yarrow Shipbuilders, had, allegedly in response to Government pressure, sold 51% of them to another company for £1,800,000. Yarrow Shipbuilders had subsequently incurred losses and in 1971 Yarrow had repurchased the shareholding for £1, a loan of £4,500,000 having been negotiated from the Ministry of Defence to replace working capital eroded by the losses. It was a condition of the loan that, on returning to profitability, Yarrow Shipbuilders could distribute profits by way of dividend to the parent company only with the prior authority of the Secretary of State for Defence. By 1973/1974, the loan could have been repaid, but Yarrow decided not to do so; the dividend restrictions accordingly applied throughout the Reference Period. 71. (a) The pre-tax profits of Yarrow Shipbuilders for the following years, ending on 30 June, were: 1971 - £308,000 1972 - £607,000 1973 - £3,025,000 1974 - £7,088,000 1975 - £5,619,000 1976 - £4,887,000 1977 - £3,123,000. According to Yarrow, the post-tax profits from the Reference Period to Vesting Day totalled some £12,000,000; during this period Yarrow Shipbuilders was authorised by the Secretary of State for Defence to pay dividends of only £2,600,000 to its parent company, with the result that £9,400,000 of the profits remained within the company and were included in the shareholders’ funds obtained by the Government on nationalisation. The yield which Yarrow was allowed to obtain from its subsidiary in this period was said to have been only about one-third of what it should have been. In addition to the 1971 loan from the Ministry of Defence, Yarrow Shipbuilders received between 1972 and 1977 £3,114,000 by way of Government shipbuilding grants. They all related to export contracts, such contracts having always played a significant role in the company’s turnover. (b) Yarrow stated that the value of Yarrow Shipbuilders’ net tangible assets, in accordance with accounting standards, was £1,327,000 at 30 June 1973 and that it was shown in the accounts as at 30 June 1977 to be £10,500,000. (c) The average market capitalisation of Yarrow’s ordinary shares during the Reference Period did not exceed £4,800,000. 72. Yarrow has submitted a valuation report prepared by a firm of chartered accountants, according to which a fair value for Yarrow Shipbuilders as at Vesting Day was £16,000,000. The valuation method employed was to consider what a single willing buyer, obtaining 100% control, would have paid. Two alternative approaches were used: the first involved estimating the maintainable post-tax profit level and capitalising it by the application of a price/earnings multiplier, giving a value of £16,320,000; the second involved applying a price/earnings multiplier to the latest reported after-tax earnings, giving a value of £15,750,000. The report commented that ""the net asset value of a company which is carrying on business as a going concern is generally not a major determinant in valuing its shares. The purchaser does not normally buy the shares in the expectation that its assets are to be sold, but expects them to be used in the business to earn profits"". In the alternative, Yarrow claimed that, as had been contended by the Stockholders’ Representative at the outset of the compensation negotiations (see paragraph 73 below), Yarrow Shipbuilders’ value in the Reference Period was £17,500,000. 73. In September 1977, the Stockholders’ Representative supplied the Department of Industry with a factual memorandum about Yarrow Shipbuilders. Messrs. Whinney Murray & Co.’s valuation report on the company - suggesting a figure in the range of £2,800,000 to £3,200,000 - was submitted to the Department in December 1977. It was based on the stock market capitalisation of the parent company, Yarrow, during the Reference Period. This was not only because the major part of Yarrow’s activity was carried on by Yarrow Shipbuilders (see paragraph 36 (b) above) but also because the accountants considered that ""without the financial backing of Yarrow and being unable to pay dividends under the terms of the [Ministry of Defence] loan, a purely nominal value for [Yarrow Shipbuilders] might result"". They also took the view that Yarrow Shipbuilders could not be valued on the normal criteria of earnings, dividend yield or asset backing, and noted that the stringent dividend restrictions ""affected the standing and worth"" of both the subsidiary and the parent. In March 1978, negotiations opened with an exchange of valuations between the parties: the Department’s was £2,800,000, whilst the Representative’s was £17,500,000, being an earnings-based valuation arrived at on a view of the prospective profits of Yarrow Shipbuilders for the year to June 1974 and on the assumption of an offer for sale of the shares on the stock market immediately before the Reference Period. During subsequent negotiations, points discussed included the possibility that further dividend payments in respect of the period up to Vesting Day could be authorised; whether it should be assumed that the Ministry of Defence loan would have been refinanced if the shares of Yarrow Shipbuilders had been listed on the Stock Exchange; the appropriateness of an offer-for-sale approach to valuation; the relevance of the parent-company-related method of valuation; and the effect of the dividend restriction (if any) on the stock market capitalisation of Yarrow. 74. In July 1978, the Government offered £4,000,000 and in September the Stockholders’ Representative put forward an alternative claim of £12,000,000. Further offers were made by the Government in August 1979 and August 1980, and in October 1980 compensation was finally agreed at £6,000,000. This figure was accepted by Yarrow as it had been advised that arbitration proceedings might have resulted, under the terms of the 1977 Act, in the award of an amount not exceeding its own total capitalisation of not more than £4,800,000. 75. Compensation in respect of Yarrow Shipbuilders’ shares was paid as follows: - in February 1978, a first payment on account, of £1,400,000; - in December 1978, a second payment on account, of £850,000; - on 21 October 1980, the final payment, of £3,750,000. The payments on account were effected by the issue of 9 3/4% Treasury Stock 1981, with a running yield of about 10% per annum, and the final payment, by the issue of 10% Exchequer Stock 1983, with a running yield of slightly under 11%. 76. On 1 July 1977, there vested in British Shipbuilders: (a) the shares in Vickers Shipbuilding Group Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vickers; and (b) certain other shipbuilding interests of Vickers which had, by operation of section 20 of the 1977 Act (see paragraph 18 above), vested in Vickers Shipbuilding Group Ltd., as assets appurtenant to its activities. The business thus nationalised (collectively referred to as ""Vickers Shipbuilding"") specialised in the design and construction of sophisticated warships. The activities of Vickers Shipbuilding did not constitute more than one-quarter of the total undertaking of Vickers. 77. (a) The pre-tax profits of Vickers Shipbuilding for the following years, ending on 31 December, were: 1972 - £2,618,000 1973 - £2,177,000 1974 - £5,515,000 1975 - £4,841,000 1976 - £3,746,000. In the half-year to 30 June 1977, pre-tax profits were £3,948,000. Vickers Shipbuilding was in receipt of small amounts by way of Government shipbuilding grants, all of which related to export contracts. (b) The net assets of Vickers Shipbuilding amounted to £14,337,000 as at 31 December 1972; as at 30 June 1977 its net tangible assets (that is, making no allowance for deferred tax, the amount of which is not shown in the information before the Court) were £32,431,000. 78. Vickers have submitted a valuation which, taking into account profit record, future prospects and net assets, indicated that, on the basis of a transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller, the value of Vickers Shipbuilding as at Vesting Day was not less than £25,000,000. This figure was reached by estimating the maintainable post-tax profit level and applying thereto a price/earnings multiplier, adjusted to take account of the ""control premium"" (see paragraph 98 below). 79. By virtue of section 38(7) of the 1977 Act, the shares of Vickers Shipbuilding Group Ltd. had to be valued on the assumption that during the Reference Period it had owned the interests which vested in it under section 20 (see paragraph 76 above). The compensation negotiations were therefore conducted on the basis that Vickers Shipbuilding had been a single enterprise at all relevant times and financial data so treating it, prepared by the auditors of Vickers for use in the negotiations, were agreed in March 1978. Certain other preliminary matters (including one related to taxation) arose, and were ultimately settled. 80. Messrs. Whinney Murray & Co.’s valuation report on Vickers Shipbuilding - suggesting a figure in the range of £11,500,000 to £12,700,000 - was submitted to the Department of Industry in May 1978; it was based on earnings (see paragraph 36 (a) above). Formal negotiations opened in the following month with an exchange of memoranda: the Department offered compensation of £10,550,000 and the Stockholders’ Representative claimed £20,060,000. The Department subsequently increased their offer to £13,500,000, whilst the Representative indicated that £17,000,000 was the lowest acceptable figure. In November 1978, the Department stated that they were not prepared to increase their offer further and that, in the event of arbitration, they would take their stand at a lower figure; the Stockholders’ Representative replied that resort would be had to arbitration. In September 1979 - after the general election of May 1979 (see paragraph 17 above) -, Vickers was informed that the new Government had decided not to change the compensation terms and had confirmed the Department’s negotiating limit of £13,500,000. 81. In the same month, the Stockholders’ Representative instituted proceedings before the Arbitration Tribunal (see paragraphs 29-32 above). Written pleadings were exchanged, in which the Stockholders’ Representative contended for compensation of £16,695,999 and the Department, of £12,210,000. The hearing started in September 1980. However, on 26 September 1980, compensation was agreed between the parties at a figure of £14,450,000. 82. In January 1978, the Department of Industry had informed Vickers that no payment on account of compensation, pursuant to section 36(6) of the 1977 Act, would then be made because discussions on the taxation matter (see paragraph 79 in fine above) were not then concluded. Compensation in respect of the nationalised undertaking was subsequently paid as follows: - in April 1978 or thereabouts, a first payment on account, of £4,000,000; - in July 1978 or thereabouts, a second payment on account, of £1,250,000; - in November 1978 or thereabouts, a third payment on account, of £3,200,000; - in March 1980 or thereabouts, a fourth payment on account, of £3,150,000; - in September 1980 or thereabouts, the final payment, of £2,850,000. The first three payments on account were effected by the issue of 9 3/4% Treasury Stock 1981, bearing a running yield of about 10% per annum, and the fourth payment on account and the final payment, by the issue of 10% Exchequer Stock 1983, bearing a running yield of about 11%. 83. On 1 July 1977, there vested in British Shipbuilders the shares in Brooke Marine Ltd. (""Brooke Marine""), which carried on at Lowestoft a shipbuilding business specialised in the construction of small naval vessels. Those shares were owned as to 74.39% by Dowsett, as to 21.34% by Investors and as to 4.27% by Prudential. The securities which vested included 196,000 shares issued to the owners in March 1976, following their exercise of an option, exercisable by that date, to convert debenture stock into new shares. 84. (a) Brooke Marine’s pre-tax profits for the following years, ending on 31 March, were: 1973 - £427,000 1974 - £523,000 1975 - £792,000 1976 - £711,000 1977 - £865,000. According to the Commission’s report, in the three months to 30 June 1977, the pre-tax profits were £270,000. Between 1973 and 1977, Brooke Marine received £888,000 by way of Government shipbuilding grants. About 70% of its turnover came from exports. (b) Brooke Marine’s net assets amounted to £1,049,000 as at 31 March 1973 and to £4,870,000 as at 30 June 1977. At the hearings before the Court, the former owners of Brooke Marine stated that its net assets at Vesting Day included £2.2 million in cash. 85. During 1973-1974, Brooke Marine had negotiations with the Vickers Shipbuilding Group and Vosper Thornycroft Ltd. concerning a possible purchase of Brooke Marine - at a figure between £2,500,000 and £3,000,000 - by one or other of these companies. The negotiations lapsed due to the prospect of nationalisation. 86. Dowsett, Investors and Prudential have submitted a valuation report, prepared by a firm of chartered accountants, which indicated that, on the basis of a sale by a willing seller to a single willing buyer of the business as a going concern at Vesting Day, a fair valuation of Brooke Marine as at that day was £5,000,000. This figure was reached by estimating the maintainable post-tax profit level and applying thereto a price/earnings multiplier, adjusted to take account of the ""control premium"" (see paragraph 98 below). The Government did not accept that either the profits figure or the multiplier used was appropriate. 87. Prior to Vesting Day, Brooke Marine had had contacts with the Department of Industry about matters connected with compensation. In the first place, the Department declined, on 28 January 1975, to give an assurance that, in the fixing of compensation, account would be taken of certain development work in respect of which the Chairman of Brooke Marine had requested approval in the previous December. Such approval had been sought in order to preserve compensation rights and, possibly, to ensure compliance with the safeguarding provisions to be included in the nationalisation Act, details of which had not yet been announced. However, according to its former owners, Brooke Marine’s note of a meeting held between the company and the Department in June 1975 recorded an assurance by the latter that compensation would take into account changes in circumstances since February 1974 (the end of the Reference Period). In the second place, in view of the safeguarding provisions (see paragraphs 22-23 above), Brooke Marine, which had previously had a policy of retaining profits for investment in the development of its business, sought and obtained - with some exceptions - authorisation for the payment in the period up to July 1977 of certain dividends. According to its former owners, the company would have sought authorisation to pay higher dividends but for discussions with the Department of Industry which led it to believe that permission would be refused and that retained dividends would be taken into account under the statutory formula. According to Brooke Marine’s accounts, the total dividends authorised for the three years to 31 March 1975, 1976 and 1977 amounted to £190,000, whereas profits after tax for the same period amounted to £1,388,758. 88. In January 1978, the Stockholders’ Representative wrote to the Department protesting at the amount of the payment on account of compensation offered by the Government (£350,000), which he described as ""derisory"" in relation to the value of Brooke Marine. Messrs. Whinney Murray & Co.’s valuation report on the company - suggesting a figure in the range of £860,000 to £960,000 - was submitted to the Department in March 1978: the newly-issued shares (see paragraph 83 in fine above) were, pursuant to section 38(10) of the 1977 Act (see paragraph 19 above), valued at their issue price; the Reference Period value of the remaining shares was assessed on an earnings basis (see paragraph 36 (a) above). The factual part of the report was transmitted to the Stockholders’ Representative: according to Dowsett, Investors and Prudential, it contained some errors and important omissions, a view which was expressed in correspondence with the Department; according to the Government, there were no material inaccuracies. 89. In July 1978, formal negotiations opened: the Stockholders’ Representative sent to the Department a memorandum claiming compensation of £4,500,000, to which they responded with an offer of £806,000. After various meetings, the Department indicated, in March 1979, that they might be prepared to raise their offer, mentioning a figure of £1,400,000 to £1,500,000. During the negotiations, the Department contended that the value of Brooke Marine’s shares during the Reference Period would have been adversely affected by the existence of claims arising from certain unfavourable contracts and of the options to convert debenture stock into shares (see paragraph 83 above). According to the Department, the 1977 Act made no provision for taking into account, in determining the value, the worth of the options during the Reference Period. This view was not accepted by the Stockholders’ Representative and it was subsequently agreed that the matter should not be further discussed in negotiations. 90. In November 1979, the Department made a revised offer of £1,250,000. In further negotiations points discussed included whether section 38 of the 1977 Act required the Secretary of State (in assessing the hypothetical Stock Exchange value) to take account of the likely or only of the inevitable consequences of a company being listed; and whether the takeover negotiations with the Vickers Shipbuilding Group and Vosper Thornycroft Ltd. (see paragraph 85 above) would have been the subject of a public announcement if the shares of Brooke Marine had been listed. In August 1980, the Minister of State at the Department of Industry indicated that the Government’s absolute ceiling was £1,500,000, but, after further contacts, the offer was again raised, in December 1980, to £1,800,000. On 11 December 1980, the Stockholders’ Representative accepted this offer. 91. Compensation in respect of the Brooke Marine shares was paid as follows: - in January 1978, a first payment on account, of £350,000; - in July 1978, a second payment on account, of £50,000; - in November 1978, a third payment on account, of £250,000; - in December 1980, the final payment, of £1,150,000. The payments on account were effected by the issue of 9 3/4% Treasury Stock 1981, carrying a running yield of about 10% per annum, and the final payment, by the issue of 10% Exchequer Stock 1983, with a running yield of slightly under 11%. 92. Inflation in the United Kingdom, as measured by the official Retail Price Index, was relatively rapid in the years 1974-1980. At the start of the Reference Period (September 1973) the Index stood at 94.8. The figures for January in each of the following years were as follows: 1974 – 100 1975 - 119.9 1976 - 147.9 1977 - 172.4 1978 - 189.5 1979 - 207.2 1980 - 245.3. In April 1977, June 1977 and December 1980, the Index stood at 180.3, 183.6 and 275.6, respectively. The applicants recognised that inflation played some part in the increase in value which their nationalised undertakings were said to have shown between the end of the Reference Period and Vesting Day. 93. Share prices on the Stock Exchange did not follow the same pattern. The general level of share prices reached a high point in mid-1972, when the Financial Times Ordinary Share Index stood at over 500, and then declined to a low point in early January 1975, when that Index stood at under 150. Thereafter, the general trend was upwards for some time. The trend between the end of the Reference Period (28 February 1974) and the vesting dates under the 1977 Act (29 April and 1 July 1977) can be illustrated by reference to monthly average figures for the Financial Times Industrial Ordinary Share Index. In February 1974, the average for this Index was 316.5. The Index declined steadily during 1974, to an average of 160.1 in December. In January 1975, it rose slightly to 183.7; thereafter, there was a rapid rise, to 262.6 in February, 292.6 in March (when the compensation terms were first announced; see paragraph 12 above), 314.9 in April and 339.0 in May. After a decline between then and August, there was a more or less steady increase, until an average of 406.6 was reached in May 1976. There was then an overall decline until October 1976, when the monthly average was 293.6. Prices then rose again, the average figure in November 1976 (when the third Bill was introduced into Parliament) being 301, in April 1977 (the month of the aerospace industry Vesting Day) being 415.1 and in July 1977 (the month of the shipbuilding industry Vesting Day) being 443.1. The economic situation in the United Kingdom during the period leading up to the general election of February 1974 was affected by a number of events, including a substantial rise in the price of oil, and industrial conflict in November and December 1973 and in February 1974. Prices and dividends were subjected to control under the Counter-Inflation Act 1973. 94. The general level of interest rates rose between the vesting dates under the 1977 Act and the settlement of compensation claims. On both vesting dates, the Bank of England’s minimum lending rate stood at 8%; it rose to a peak of 17% from November 1979 to June 1980. The average rate from July 1977 to December 1979 was 10.4% and from July 1977 to December 1980, 12.1%. 95. During the proceedings before the Commission and the Court reference was made to a number of different methods of valuation of, and of compensating for, property nationalised or compulsorily acquired. The following is a brief outline of those methods. 96. A Stock Exchange valuation for listed shares merely involves looking at the price for the shares on the Stock Exchange on the specified date or dates. 97. The method laid down by the 1977 Act for valuing unlisted shares (the hypothetical Stock Exchange valuation) involved estimating what price the shares would have had on the Stock Exchange had they been listed during the Reference Period. The estimate would be made by reference to the price of any comparable quoted shares and account would be taken of all information about the company that would have been available to Stock Exchange investors during that period. Thus, Messrs. Whinney Murray & Co. based their valuations primarily on data appearing in the companies’ latest published accounts, which covered periods prior to the Reference Period, but they also made certain assumptions as to the interim - and more up-to-date - statements that would have been supplied to the stock market if the companies’ shares had been listed. However, questions might arise concerning the precise information that would have been available to investors and the extent to which they might have foreseen an undertaking’s future performance (see, for example, paragraph 57 above). Furthermore, it is implicit in this method that the company’s shares would be held by a number of different persons; accordingly, when valuing a wholly-owned subsidiary on this basis, hypothetical assumptions may have to be made as to what its business policies would have been if its shares had been more widely owned. 98. An alternative method is to consider what a single willing buyer would pay a willing seller (or sellers) for the whole of the shares in question. Here again, account would be taken of all the information that would be available to a buyer at the relevant time and an estimate would be made by reference to comparable quoted shares. However, this method could differ from the hypothetical Stock Exchange valuation method in three respects. Firstly, it might be assumed that a single buyer in takeover negotiations might have more complete information than a Stock Exchange investor. Secondly, it would not be necessary to assume that the ownership of the shares was different from the reality or to make consequent assumptions as to the company’s business policies. Thirdly, the price payable by a single buyer gaining control of a company would normally be materially higher than the Stock Exchange price, since the latter merely represents what would be paid for a small parcel of shares and does not reflect the market value of a controlling shareholding; guidance as to the additional amount (the ""control premium"") may be obtained from the premiums over previous market prices paid on successful takeover bids which, according to the applicants, averaged 34% in the first half of 1977. 99. The compensation provisions contained in the 1977 Act, whilst from many aspects similar to those contained in previous United Kingdom nationalisation legislation, differed therefrom in the following particular respects: (a) there was no choice of reference periods during which the nationalised shares were to be valued; (b) the reference period was, with certain exceptions, further removed in time from the vesting dates than the period fixed under earlier legislation, although the latter had always preceded those dates; (c) there was, in section 38(6) of the 1977 Act (see paragraph 19 above), an express requirement that when valuing a subsidiary the Arbitration Tribunal was to have regard in certain circumstances to the stock market quotation of the parent company. Furthermore, under earlier measures using share valuation methods a substantial proportion of the securities nationalised had been listed on the Stock Exchange and thus provided a comparison for valuing the unquoted securities. In the case of the 1977 Act, on the other hand, there was no quoted aerospace company and only one of the acquired shipbuilding companies, which was relatively small, had all its shares listed; however, a number of the companies nationalised were subsidiaries whose activities formed a substantial part of the business of a parent, such as Vosper and Yarrow, whose shares were listed. 100. Subject to the ultimate supremacy of Parliament, it is a rule of United Kingdom constitutional law that compensation is generally payable where property is taken by the Crown in the exercise of common-law powers. Furthermore, ""unless the words of a statute clearly so demand, a statute is not to be construed so as to take away the property of a subject without compensation"" (Attorney-General v. De Keyser’s Royal Hotel [1920] Appeal Cases 508 at p. 542). 101. The legislation on the compulsory purchase of land for public purposes provides for payment of compensation, the normal basis being the open-market value of the land with a willing seller. The value falls to be assessed, so the House of Lords held in Birmingham Corporation v. West Midland Baptist (Trust) Association [1969] 3 All England Law Reports 172, at the date when possession of the property is taken, or the date when compensation is agreed or assessed, whichever is the earlier, and not (as had previously been the practice) at the date of the ""notice to treat"", which might be considerably earlier. Works carried out after the ""notice to treat"" are excluded from the valuation, but, with some exceptions, account is taken of the possibility of development of the land.",[],[],[],"['13', '14', '6', 'P1']","['6-1', 'P1-1']",[],0
62,001-84067,ENG,LTU,ADMISSIBILITY,2007,SADAUSKIENE v. LITHUANIA,4,Inadmissible,,"The applicant, Mrs Krestina Sadauskienė, is a Lithuanian national who was born in 1948 and lives in Vilnius. The Lithuanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms E. Baltutytė. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 12 June 1998 the applicant’s 17-year-old son took part in a schoolchildren’s outdoor camp near the Girija lake in the Vilnius region, uniting over 100 pupils and their supervisors. The applicant’s son came with a group of 22 pupils, supervised by three teachers. On 13 June 1998 the police were alerted that the boy had gone missing. On 14 June 1998 the corpse of the applicant’s son was found in the lake. On the same date the police carried out an examination of the place of the incident and questioned several witnesses. An autopsy of the body began the same day and was completed on 18 June 1998. 1.43% of alcohol was found in his blood, but the body carried no signs of violence. The experts referred to the likelihood that the boy had drowned while swimming in the lake. The applicant applied to the prosecutors, claiming that her son may have been murdered, and that the schoolteachers had not performed their duty of supervision. On 1 July 1998 a Vilnius area district prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in respect of the death of the applicant’s son. On 7 July 1998 a higher prosecutor quashed this decision, ordering further investigation in order to confirm or rule out the hypothesis of a violent death. He instructed the prosecution to question all the schoolchildren who had gone to the camp with the applicant’s son and to examine the scene of the incident, the pictures of the deceased taken by the applicant just before the funeral, as well as, her son’s belongings in order to establish the origin of the blood stains noticeable on some of them. From 9 July 1998 to 17 August 1998, the prosecution questioned 14 witnesses, including the applicant, accepted the opinion of a medical expert, repeatedly examined the place of the incident and conducted an inquiry into a possible fight among the campmates. Furthermore, from 16 to 30 July 1998, a biological DNA examination of the belongings of the applicant’s son was performed. The expert found some blood stains on the T-shirt of the victim but, because of the small amount of blood involved, it was not possible to establish its origin. On 17 August 1998 a Vilnius area district prosecutor again took a decision to refuse to institute criminal proceedings in view of the absence of any indication of a violent death. The prosecutor referred to the results of the autopsy and the DNA examination, as well as the submissions of various witnesses. The applicant complained, requesting further details to be assessed. On 25 August 1998 a higher district prosecutor quashed the decision, ordering, inter alia, the questioning of all the participants of the camp, the divers who had found the corpse, and certain other people. In accordance with that order, the prosecution carried out additional investigative measures; in particular, the submissions of 52 witnesses were recorded, experts were questioned, the police and other relevant officials were called upon to conduct an inquiry into certain details of the incident, and further inspections of the scene of the incident was carried out. On 29 January 1999 a Vilnius area district prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the death of the applicant’s son (Article 104 of the Criminal Code as then in force). Nor did the prosecutor consider that there were any grounds for the criminal prosecution of the schoolteachers or organisers of the camp for the allegedly improper execution of their official duties (Article 288). The applicant was advised that she could claim damages by way of civil proceedings. The applicant and her husband addressed the General Prosecutor’s Office, submitting further details and requesting an additional inquiry. On 25 June 1999 a prosecutor in the Office of the Prosecutor General quashed the decision, ordering additional investigative measures, including the questioning of new witnesses, the examination of the towel of the deceased, an inquiry into the hypothesis that there may have been a fight at the camp, and a request for information about the meteorological conditions on the day of the incident. On 29 July 1999 the applicant reported that she had received an anonymous letter referring to the alleged “murderers” of her son. An inquiry into these newly discovered details was carried out, including the questioning of 10 witnesses. On 7 September 1999 a Vilnius area district prosecutor again refused to institute criminal proceedings on the same grounds as before. The applicant appealed, alleging that the prosecution had not made an adequate investigation into the anonymous letter. On 2 November 1999 a Vilnius regional prosecutor quashed the decision, instituting criminal proceedings into the death of the applicant’s son. Thereafter, the investigation was prolonged a number of times. During a further examination, 46 witnesses were questioned, some of them repeatedly, several confrontations of the witnesses were undertaken, additional information about the camp participants was gathered, the version of a possible fight in the camp was again assessed, writing samples were taken and an expert examination of the anonymous letter carried out, and several experts were heard. On 1 May 2000 the district prosecutor decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings. It was noted, inter alia, that no evidence of a violent crime could be found, despite the questioning of numerous witnesses and experts. The applicant filed a hierarchical complaint, requesting the quashing of the decision of 1 May 2000. On 16 June 2000 the Office of the Prosecutor General refused her request, stating that the decision to discontinue the investigation was lawful and substantiated. The applicant was advised that she could request judicial review of the decision of 1 May 2000. On 27 November 2001 the applicant applied to the Vilnius District Court, asking it to reinstate the time-limit to complain about the decision of 1 May 2000. On 1 March 2002 a judge the Vilnius District Court granted her request, quashed the decision of 1 May 2000 and ordered the Vilnius area district prosecutors to carry out further investigative measures, including the questioning of the applicant and her husband, as well as establishing the identity of certain persons with whom the applicant’s son could have had contact in the camp. The judge also referred to the pictures of the corpse that the applicant had made after the autopsy which allegedly showed signs of violence on the boy’s face, and ordered them to be submitted to an expert. The judge noted that it was not clear from the case file whether these particular pictures had been the subject of an expert examination before. The criminal investigation was renewed. Between 18 and 22 April 2002 a repeat medical expert examination of the pictures was carried out, in order to establish the credibility of the version of a violent death. The experts confirmed that no signs of violence could be identified from the pictures taken before the funeral. It was noted that the pictures taken by the applicant just before the burial exhibited some marks on the face of the boy. Whereas the applicant considered them to be signs of violence, the experts explained that the marks were the result of the fact that the body had stayed in the water. On 22 April 2002 the prosecutor discontinued the investigation because of the lack of evidence of a crime. On 7 May 2002 a Vilnius regional prosecutor quashed the decision, referring, inter alia, to the need to question witnesses and obtain supplementary data about the participants at the camp. The case was sent to the Vilnius city district prosecutors, who again reinstated the investigation on 13 May 2002. The further questioning of witnesses and experts as well as a confrontation were held. On 13 June 2002 the Vilnius city district prosecutor discontinued the investigation in view of the absence of evidence of the crime of murder or the improper execution of official duties. On 19 July 2002 the Vilnius regional prosecutor quashed the decision, ordering, inter alia, the questioning of further witnesses and the characterisation of certain participants at the camp. On 23 July 2002 the investigation was again renewed by the Vilnius city district prosecutors and further investigative actions were carried out, including the questioning of eight witnesses. On 23 October 2002 a Vilnius city district prosecutor adopted a 23-page long decision, discontinuing the criminal investigation in view of the absence of evidence of a crime under the then Articles 104 and 288 of the Criminal Code. It was concluded that the applicant’s son had drowned in the lake from swimming whilst under the influence of alcohol, and that he had been responsible for his own death. The decision was based on the submissions of 46 witnesses, some of whom had been confronted, in order to eliminate contradictions in the evidence, the results of four expert examinations, the expert submissions, as well as other evidence. On 3 December 2002 the Vilnius Region Prosecutors’ Office rejected the applicant’s hierarchical appeal. It was noted that the investigation had been thorough: 73 witnesses had been questioned, some of them many times; the examination of the place of the incident had been carried out three times; two medical examinations and a DNA examination of the blood sample had been completed, but with no result because of the small amount of blood involved; experts were questioned and a handwriting analysis of the anonymous letter had been performed. There was no evidence to indicate that the boy had been the victim of violence, despite the attempts to examine the numerous versions put forward by his parents. All hypotheses had been dutifully verified, inter alia, by questioning the relevant experts and the witnesses, some of whom had been heard several times but had not been able to provide any new information. The applicant applied to a court. On 23 January 2003 the Vilnius City First District Court examined the applicant’s appeal in a written procedure and rejected it. It noted that the main source of objective evidence – the expert examination of the corpse and the pictures. This hypothesis was corroborated by the submissions of various witnesses and other evidence. The court opined that all possible means to obtain evidence had been exhausted. That decision was final. On 25 August 1998 the three schoolteachers who had accompanied the applicant’s son to the camp received a disciplinary reprimand for their failure to ensure the safety of the camp participants. On an unspecified date the applicant brought civil proceedings for damages against the employer of those teachers – a State-run school. She claimed 9,379 Lithuanian litas (“LTL”; approximately 2,718 euros) to cover the funeral expenses. Whereas the applicant’s claims were rejected at first and second instance by, respectively, the Vilnius City Third District on 20 December 2000 and the Vilnius Regional Court on 14 February 2001, the Supreme Court reversed those decisions on 11 June 2001, holding that the school was liable to cover the expenses of the funeral of the applicant’s son. The Supreme Court reduced the amount claimed to LTL 7,500 (approximately EUR 2,174), referring to the fact that the applicant’s son had been largerly responsible for his own death. The applicant did not claim non-pecuniary damages. The Criminal Code applicable at the material time punished murder (Article 104) and the improper execution of official duties (Article 288). The Code of Criminal Procedure (in force from 12 June 1998 to 23 January 2003) provided: Article 5 “Criminal proceedings shall not be instituted or ... shall be discontinued in the following cases: 1) where no crime has occurred...” Article 128 “The prosecutor ... shall receive the applications and reports of a crime ... and shall take a relevant decision within three or, in exceptional circumstances, ten days from the receipt of the application or report. The necessary material shall be obtained and submissions taken, but no investigative actions foreseen in this Code shall be carried out. One of the following decisions shall be taken regarding the application or report: - to institute criminal proceedings; - to refuse to institute criminal proceedings ... . The applicant shall be informed about the decision taken.” Article 131 “Where no grounds for the institution of criminal proceedings are established ... the prosecutor ... or the court shall refuse to open criminal proceedings. ... The person concerned who submitted an application [about the alleged criminal acts], shall be informed about that decision as well as about his/her right to appeal against it. The decision of the prosecutor ... to refuse to institute criminal proceedings can be challenged before the higher prosecutor or a court ... .” Article 244 of the Code stipulated that the actions and decisions of the prosecutor could be challenged before a higher prosecutor or, since 17 April 2002, before a court. Article 244-2 provided for the judicial review of the actions and decisions of the prosecutor, stipulating as follows: “The prosecutor and the complainant may attend the hearing... . The complainant shall be informed about the court’s decision ... . That decision shall be final.”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
63,001-57968,ENG,FRA,CHAMBER,1995,CASE OF G. v. FRANCE,3,Lack of jurisdiction (complaint inadmissible);No violation of Art. 7-1,,"7. Mr G., a driving test examiner, was charged on 14 December 1980 with accepting bribes. It was alleged that he had issued driving licences in exchange for payment of a sum of money (Article 177 of the Criminal Code, see paragraph 12 below). In the course of the investigation and following additional submissions from the prosecuting authority, the investigating judge charged him with ""corruption in the form of soliciting sexual favours"" and indecent assault with violence or coercion (see paragraph 13 below) on the person of P., a driving test candidate. The investigating judge based the second charge on Article 333 of the Criminal Code as amended by the Law of 23 December 1980 (see paragraph 14 below). It was specifically alleged that G. had, on 14 November 1980, constrained a young woman who suffered from a slight mental handicap to submit to acts of buggery. At the material time such acts were classified as indecent assault rather than rape. 8. On 18 November 1982 the Rennes Criminal Court sentenced him to five years' imprisonment, two of which were suspended, for accepting bribes as a citizen responsible for a public service and indecent assault with violence or coercion by a person in authority. In so doing, the court was applying the Law of 23 December 1980 (see paragraph 14 below). The Rennes Court of Appeal upheld that decision in a judgment of 14 November 1983. On 26 February 1985 the latter judgment was quashed by the Court of Cassation on the ground that no reply had been given to the pleas of nullity. The case was remitted to the Angers Court of Appeal. 9. In a judgment of 22 January 1987 that court rejected the pleas of nullity. It dismissed the charge of corruption in the form of soliciting sexual favours, but found the applicant guilty of accepting bribes and of indecent assault with coercion and abuse of authority. It reduced his sentence to three years' imprisonment by virtue of Law no. 80-1041 of 23 December 1980, whose entry into force postdated the commission of the offences in question (see paragraph 14 below). 10. The applicant lodged a further appeal on points of law with the Court of Cassation. The fourth and last ground of this appeal was formulated as follows: ""Violation of Article 7 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, of Articles 4, 332 and 333 of the Criminal Code as applicable to the alleged offences and Article 593 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, failure to state reasons and lack of a legal basis; In so far as the impugned judgment found the defendant guilty of indecent assault on the person of P. on 14 November 1980; ... Before the entry into force of Law no. 80-1041 of 23 December 1980, under the Criminal Code the offence of indecent assault with coercion was not committed where no violence had been practised on the person who had been the object of that coercion; no one may be convicted in respect of acts which the law did not regard as an offence before they were carried out and the alleged indecent assault with coercion of which the appellant is accused did not, at the material time, constitute any criminal offence; nor did the mental deficiency of the `victim' constitute an aggravating circumstance. The acts in question could not therefore be punished under this head. By ruling as it did, the Court of Appeal violated the principle that no act may be classified as a punishable offence unless the law makes prior provision to that effect."" 11. On 25 January 1989 the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal. It explained its rejection of the above-mentioned ground in the following terms: ""The finding of guilt on the count [of accepting bribes] justified the sentence imposed; in accordance with Article 598 of the Code of Criminal Procedure [see paragraph 15 below] it is therefore unnecessary to rule on the fourth ground of appeal put forward by the appellant."" 12. Article 177 1° of the Criminal Code is worded as follows: ""Anyone who has solicited or accepted offers or promises, solicited or received gifts or presents shall be liable to a term of imprisonment of from two to ten years and a fine equal to double the value of the promises accepted or the articles received or requested, such fine not being less than FRF 1,500, where he has done so 1° as a person holding elected office, being a public servant in the administrative or judicial branch of the civil service, a member of the armed forces or having equivalent status, the agent or representative of a public administrative authority or of an administrative authority placed under the control of the public authorities or a citizen responsible for a public service, in return for performing or refraining from performing one of his duties or one of the tasks attaching to his post, whether fair or not, but not covered by his salary."" 13. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code were as follows: ""Any indecent assault committed or attempted without violence on the person of a child of either sex under the age of fifteen years shall be punished by between five and ten years' imprisonment. The same penalty shall be imposed in respect of indecent assault by any relative in the ascending line carried out on the person of a minor, even if the victim is aged over fifteen years provided that he or she is unmarried. Without prejudice to the more severe penalties laid down in the foregoing paragraphs or in Articles 332 and 333 of the present Code, whosoever shall commit an indecent or unnatural act with a person of the same sex aged less than twenty-one years shall be punished by between six months' and three years' imprisonment and a fine of between FRF 60 and FRF 15,000."" ""Whosoever shall commit the crime of rape shall be sentenced to between ten and twenty years' imprisonment. If the offence has been committed on the person of a child not having fully attained fifteen years of age, the offender shall receive the maximum penalty available. Whosoever shall commit or attempt to commit indecent assault with violence on individuals of either sex shall be sentenced to between five and ten years' imprisonment. If the crime has been committed on the person of a child not having fully attained fifteen years of age, the offender shall be sentenced to between ten and twenty years' imprisonment."" ""If the offenders are relatives in the ascending line of the person on whom the indecent assault was carried out, if they belong to the class of those who have authority over that person, if they are his or her schoolteachers or hired servants, or hired servants of the above-mentioned persons, if they are officials or ministers of a religion, or if the offender, whoever he may be, was assisted in his offence by one or more persons, the penalty shall be between ten and twenty years' imprisonment in the case provided for in the first paragraph of Article 331 and life imprisonment in the cases provided for in the preceding Article."" As there was no statutory definition of the notions of rape and indecent assault, the case-law delimited the scope of those terms. Thus coercion or non-physical violence has been treated as equivalent to physical violence. Consequently the offences were constituted where they had been committed without the victim's consent (see judgments of the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation of 5 July 1838, Bulletin no. 191; of 27 September 1860, Bulletin no. 219; of 25 June 1857, Bulletin no. 240; of 27 December 1883, Bulletin no. 295; and of 17 November 1960, Bulletin no. 528). 14. Articles 332 and 333 of the Criminal Code were amended by Law no. 80-1041 of 23 December 1980, which entered into force on 24 December 1980. They now read as follows: ""Any act of sexual penetration, of whatever nature, committed on the person of another by violence, coercion or by taking the victim unawares shall constitute rape. Rape shall be punished by between five and ten years' imprisonment. However, rape shall be punished by between ten and twenty years' imprisonment where it has been committed either on a person who was especially vulnerable owing to pregnancy, sickness, infirmity or physical or mental deficiency, or on a person under the age of fifteen years, or with the threatened use of a weapon, or by two or more assailants or accomplices, or by a legitimate, natural or adoptive ascendant of the victim or by a person in a position of authority over the victim or by a person who has abused the authority conferred by his duties."" ""Any other indecent assault committed or attempted with violence, coercion or by taking the victim unawares on a person other than a minor under the age of fifteen years shall be punished by between three and five years' imprisonment and a fine of between FRF 6,000 and FRF 60,000 or by one of these penalties alone. However, indecent assault as defined in the first paragraph shall be punished by between five years' and ten years' imprisonment and a fine of between FRF 12,000 and FRF 120,000 or one of these penalties alone where it was committed or attempted either against a person who was particularly vulnerable owing to sickness, infirmity or physical or mental deficiency or pregnancy, or with the threatened use of a weapon, or by a legitimate, natural or adoptive ascendant of the victim or by a person in a position of authority over the victim, or by two or more assailants or accomplices, or by a person who has abused the authority conferred on him by his duties."" The new law downgraded the offence of indecent assault from serious offence (crime) to less serious offence (délit). 15. Article 5 of the Criminal Code provides that ""in the event of conviction for several serious offences and less serious offences, only the heaviest penalty available for one of the individual offences shall be imposed"". This principle that sentences are not to be imposed consecutively is part of the basis for the doctrine of justified penalty laid down in Article 598 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, according to which: ""Where the penalty imposed is the same as that which would be imposed under the law that applies to the offence, any application to have the judgment quashed on the basis that there has been an error in the citation of the relevant provision shall fail."" Thus the Court of Cassation will declare the operative part of a judgment imposing a sentence to be justified where the sentence imposed is identical to that which the trial court would have ordered if the error of classification had not been committed. Where the appellant has been convicted of several offences, the court will not examine the ground based on the error and directed against one of the offences if the penalty imposed is justified by the other offences (see judgments of the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation of 25 September 1890, Bulletin no. 196; of 30 October 1925, Recueil Dalloz 1926, p. 6; of 25 March 1927, Recueil Dalloz 1927, p. 287; of 7 November 1931, Recueil Dalloz 1931, p. 559).",[],[],[],['7'],['7-1'],[],0

The applicant is a Latvian national who was born in 1950 and lives in Riga. She is currently a member of the European Parliament. 12. On 23 August 1939 the foreign ministers of Germany and the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) signed a non-aggression treaty (the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact). The treaty included a secret additional protocol, approved on 23 August 1939 and amended on 28 September 1939, whereby Germany and the Soviet Union agreed to settle the map of their “spheres of influence” in the event of a future “territorial and political rearrangement” of the territories of the then independent countries of central and eastern Europe, including the three Baltic States of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. After Germany’s invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 and the subsequent start of the Second World War, the Soviet Union began exerting considerable pressure on the governments of the Baltic States with a view to taking control of those countries pursuant to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and its additional protocol. 13. Following an ultimatum to allow an unlimited number of Soviet troops to be stationed in the Baltic countries, on 16-17 June 1940 the Soviet army invaded Latvia and the other two independent States. The government of Latvia was removed from office, and a new government was formed under the direction of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (“the CPSU”), the USSR’s only party. From 21 July to 3 August 1940 the Soviet Union completed the annexation of Latvia, which became part of the USSR under the name “Soviet Socialist Republic of Latvia” (“Latvian SSR”). 14. The applicant was born in Riga into a Russian-speaking family. In 1971 she joined the Communist Party of Latvia (“the CPL”) while studying at the University of Latvia in Riga. The CPL was in fact a regional branch of the CPSU. From 1972 to 1990 the applicant worked as a lecturer at the University of Latvia. Throughout this period she was a member of the CPL. 15. In the late 1980s there was considerable social pressure in Latvia, as in other east European countries, for the democratisation of political life. As a result of the newly introduced freedom of expression in the territory of the Soviet Union, mass political movements were formed in Latvia, as well as in the other Baltic States, condemning the annexation of the country, asserting the need to construct a new society based, inter alia, on Latvian identity and values, and emphasising the need to restore State independence. 16. The first independent elections under the Soviet regime took place on Latvian territory in March 1990. The applicant was elected to the Supreme Council (Augstākā Padome) of the Latvian SSR as a representative for the Pļavnieki constituency in Riga. She subsequently joined the CPL’s local branch. In April 1990 this branch selected her to attend the CPL’s 25th Congress, where she was elected to the party’s Central Committee for Supervision and Audit. According to copies of that committee’s minutes, the applicant was a member of a sub-committee responsible for supervising the implementation of decisions and activities arising from the CPL programme. 17. At the same congress, a group of delegates expressed their disagreement with the CPL’s general policy, which remained loyal to the Soviet Union and the CPSU. According to those delegates, the CPL was opposed to any democratisation of public life and sought to maintain the status quo of the Soviet rule. These delegates publicly announced their withdrawal from the CPL and established a new party, the “Independent Communist Party of Latvia”, which immediately declared its support for Latvian independence and for a multi-party political system. The applicant did not join the dissident delegates and remained with the CPL. 18. On 4 May 1990 the Supreme Council adopted a Declaration on the Restoration of the Independence of the Republic of Latvia, which declared Latvia’s incorporation into the USSR unlawful and void and restored legal force to the fundamental provisions of the Latvian Constitution (Satversme) of 1922. However, paragraph 5 of the Declaration introduced a transition period, aimed at a gradual restoration of genuine State sovereignty as each institutional tie with the USSR was severed. During that transition period, various provisions of the Constitution of the Latvian SSR would remain in force. A special governmental commission was given responsibility for negotiating with the Soviet Union on the basis of the Russo-Latvian Peace Treaty of 11 August 1920. The above-mentioned Declaration was adopted by 139 out of a total of 201 Supreme Council members, with one abstention. Fifty-seven members of the Līdztiesība parliamentary bloc (“Equal Rights”, in fact the CPL group), including the applicant, did not vote. On the same day, 4 May 1990, the Central Committee of the CPL adopted a resolution strongly criticising the Declaration and calling on the President of the Soviet Union to intervene. 19. On 7 May 1990 the Supreme Council approved the government of the independent Republic of Latvia. 20. On the evening of 12 January 1991 the Soviet army launched military operations against the neighbouring country of Lithuania, whose government had been formed in the same way as the Latvian government. Soviet troops entered the television tower of Vilnius and the headquarters of Lithuanian public television, and also tried to take the seats of the Lithuanian parliament and other authorities. Massive crowds, made up of Lithuanian citizens, came to the rescue of the institutions of the newly independent Lithuania. Thirteen Lithuanian civilians were killed and hundreds injured during the clash with the Soviet army. 21. The parties disagree as to who was responsible for the deaths during the events in Vilnius on 12-13 January 1991. According to the respondent Government, the CPSU was directly responsible for those deaths, in that it had full and effective control of the Soviet troops. The applicant contested the Government’s version, stating that the Soviet army’s aggression against the Lithuanian government and the Lithuanian people was not a proven fact; in this connection, she submitted a copy of a Russian newspaper article which alleged that it had been the Lithuanian independence supporters themselves who fired into the crowd with the aim of discrediting the Soviet army. 22. At the same time, an attempted coup was launched in Latvia. On 13 January 1991 the plenum of the CPL Central Committee called for the resignation of the Latvian government, the dissolution of the Supreme Council and the assumption of full powers by the Latvian Public Rescue Committee (Vislatvijas Sabiedriskās glābšanas komiteja), set up on the same date by several organisations including the CPL. On 15 January 1991 this committee announced that the Supreme Council and the government were stripped of their respective powers and declared that it was assuming full powers. After causing the loss of five civilian lives and injuries to thirty-four persons during armed clashes in Riga, this attempted coup failed. 23. According to the respondent Government, it was absolutely clear that the attempted coup in Latvia was launched by the CPL against the background of the Vilnius events, in the hope that Soviet troops would also invade Riga to support the pro-Soviet coup. The applicant submitted that, at the material time, a series of public demonstrations had been held in Latvia to protest against the rise in food prices introduced by the Latvian government; those demonstrations were thus the main reason for the events of January 1991. The applicant also emphasised that, in their respective statements of 13 and 15 January 1991, the plenum of the CPL Central Committee and the Latvian Public Rescue Committee had not only called for and announced the removal of the Latvian authorities, but had also stated that early elections would be held for the Supreme Council. 24. On 3 March 1991 a national plebiscite was held on Latvian territory. Electors had to reply to a question worded as follows: “Do you support a democratic and politically independent Republic of Latvia?” According to figures supplied by the Government, 87.5% of all residents registered on the electoral roll voted, and 73.6% of them replied in the affirmative. According to the Government, this was a genuine national referendum, confirming the support of the overwhelming majority of the Latvian population for the idea of national independence. The applicant maintains that it was a simple consultative vote and contests the above-mentioned turnout, and thus the very legitimacy of the plebiscite. 25. On 19 August 1991 there was an attempted coup in Moscow. The self-proclaimed “National State of Emergency Committee” announced that Mr Gorbachev, President of the USSR, was suspended from his duties, declared itself the sole ruling authority and imposed a state of emergency “in certain regions of the USSR”. 26. On the same day the Central Committee and the Riga Committee of the CPL declared their support for the National State of Emergency Committee and set up an “operational group” to provide assistance to it. According to the Government, on 20 August 1991 the CPL, the Līdztiesība parliamentary bloc and various other organisations signed and disseminated an appeal entitled “Godājamie Latvijas iedzīvotāji!” (“Honourable residents of Latvia!”), urging the population to comply with the requirements of the state of emergency and not to oppose the measures imposed by the National State of Emergency Committee in Moscow. According to the applicant, the CPL’s participation in all those events has not been proved; in particular, the members of the Līdztiesība bloc were taking part in parliamentary debates over two consecutive days and were not even aware that such an appeal was to be issued. 27. This coup also failed. On 21 August 1991, the Latvian Supreme Council enacted a constitutional law on the status of the Republic of Latvia as a State and proclaimed the country’s immediate and absolute independence. Paragraph 5 of the Declaration of 4 May 1990, concerning the transition period, was repealed. 28. By a decision of 23 August 1991, the Supreme Council declared the CPL unconstitutional. The following day, the party’s activities were suspended and the Minister of Justice was instructed “to investigate the unlawful activities of the CPL and to put forward ... a motion on the possibility of authorising its continued operations”. On the basis of the proposal by the Minister of Justice, the Supreme Council ordered the party’s dissolution on 10 September 1991. 29. In the meantime, on 22 August 1991 the Supreme Council set up a parliamentary committee to investigate the involvement of members of the Līdztiesība bloc in the coup. On the basis of that committee’s final report, on 9 July 1992 the Supreme Council revoked fifteen members’ right to sit in Parliament. The applicant was not one of those concerned. 30. In February 1993 the applicant became chairperson of the Movement for Social Justice and Equal Rights in Latvia (Kustība par sociālo taisnīgumu un līdztiesību Latvijā), which later became a political party, Līdztiesība (“Equal rights”). 31. On 5 and 6 June 1993 parliamentary elections were held in accordance with the restored Constitution of 1922. For the first time since Latvian independence had been regained, the population elected the parliament (Saeima), which took over from the Supreme Council. It was at that point that the applicant’s term of office as a member of parliament expired. As a result of the Latvian authorities’ refusal to include her on the residents’ register as a Latvian citizen, she was unable to take part in those elections, in the following parliamentary elections held in 1995, or in the municipal elections of 1994. Following an appeal by the applicant, the courts recognised her as holding Latvian nationality by right in January 1996, on the ground of her being a descendant of a person who had possessed Latvian nationality before 1940. The courts therefore instructed the electoral authorities to register the applicant and to supply her with the appropriate documents. 32. By a final judgment of the Supreme Court of 27 July 1995, A.R. and O.P., formerly the most senior officials of the CPL, were found guilty of attempting to overthrow the legitimate authorities of independent Latvia by violent means. The judgment accepted, inter alia, the following circumstances as historical facts: (a) Having failed to obtain a majority on the Supreme Council in the democratic elections of March 1990, the CPL and the other organisations listed in section 5(6) of the Parliamentary Elections Act decided to take the unconstitutional route and set up the Latvian Public Rescue Committee, which attempted to usurp power and to dissolve the Supreme Council and the legitimate government of Latvia. Such actions were contrary not only to Article 2 of the 1922 Constitution, which stated that sovereign power was vested in the people, but also to Article 2 of the Constitution of the Latvian SSR, which conferred authority to act on behalf of the people on elected councils (soviets) alone. (b) The Central Committee of the CPL provided financial support to the special unit of the Soviet police which was entirely responsible for the fatal incidents of January 1991 (see paragraphs 22-23 above); at the same time, the Latvian Public Rescue Committee publicly expressed its support for this militarised body. (c) During the coup of August 1991 the Central Committee of the CPL openly declared its support for the National State of Emergency Committee, set up an “operational group” with a view to providing assistance to it and published an appeal calling on the public to comply with the regime imposed by this self-proclaimed and unconstitutional body. 33. On 25 January 1997 the Movement for Social Justice and Equal Rights in Latvia submitted to the Riga Electoral Commission a list of ten candidates for the forthcoming municipal elections of 9 March 1997. The applicant was one of those candidates. In accordance with the requirements of the Municipal Elections Act, she signed the list and attached a written statement confirming that she was not one of the persons referred to in section 9 of that Act. Under the terms of the Act, individuals who had “actively participated” (darbojušās) in the CPSU, the CPL and several other named organisations after 13 January 1991 were not entitled to stand for office. In a letter sent on the same day, the applicant informed the Electoral Commission that she had been a member of the CPL’s Pļavnieki branch and of its Central Committee for Supervision and Audit until 10 September 1991, the date of the CPL’s official dissolution. However, she argued that the restrictions mentioned above were not applicable to her, since they were contrary to Articles 2 and 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 34. By a decision of 11 February 1997, the Riga Electoral Commission registered the list submitted by the applicant. At the elections of 9 March 1997 this list obtained four of the sixty seats on Riga City Council (Rīgas Dome). The applicant was one of those elected. 35. With a view to participating in the parliamentary elections of 3 October 1998, the Movement for Social Justice and Equal Rights in Latvia formed a coalition with the Party of National Harmony (Tautas Saskaņas partija), the Latvian Socialist Party (Latvijas Sociālistiskā partija) and the Russian Party (Krievu partija). The four parties formed a united list entitled “Party of National Harmony”. The applicant appeared on this list as a candidate for the constituencies of Riga and Vidzeme. On 28 July 1998 the list was submitted to the Central Electoral Commission for registration. In accordance with the requirements of the Parliamentary Elections Act, the applicant signed the list and attached to it a written statement identical to the one she had submitted prior to the municipal elections. As she had done for the 1997 elections, she likewise sent a letter to the Central Electoral Commission explaining her situation and arguing that the restrictions in question were incompatible with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. 36. On 29 July 1998 the Central Electoral Commission suspended registration of the list on the ground that the applicant’s candidacy did not meet the requirements of the Parliamentary Elections Act. Not wishing to jeopardise the entire list’s prospects of being registered, the applicant withdrew her candidacy, after which the list was immediately registered. 37. By a letter of 7 August 1998, the President of the Central Electoral Commission asked the Prosecutor General to examine the legitimacy of the applicant’s election to the Riga City Council. 38. By a decision of 31 August 1998, a copy of which was sent to the Central Electoral Commission, the Office of the Prosecutor General (Ģenerālprokuratūra) noted that the applicant had not committed any act defined as an offence in the Criminal Code. The decision stated that, although the applicant had provided false information to the Riga Electoral Commission regarding her participation in the CPL, there was nothing to prove that she had done so with the specific objective of misleading the commission. In that connection, the prosecutors considered that the statement by the applicant, appended to the list of candidates for the elections of 9 March 1997, was to be read in conjunction with her explanatory letter of 25 January 1997. 39. On 14 January 1999 the Office of the Prosecutor General applied to the Riga Regional Court for a finding that the applicant had participated in the activities of the CPL after 13 January 1991. The prosecutors attached the following documents to their submission: the applicant’s letter of 25 January 1997; the minutes of the meeting of 26 January 1991 of the CPL’s Central Committee for Supervision and Audit; the minutes of the joint meeting of 27 March 1991 of the Central Committee for Supervision and Audit and the municipal and regional committees for supervision and audit; and the annexes to those minutes, indicating the structure and composition of the said committee and a list of the members of the Audit Committee at 1 July 1991. 40. Following adversarial proceedings, the Riga Regional Court allowed the prosecutors’ request in a judgment of 15 February 1999. It considered that the documents in its possession clearly attested to the applicant’s active participation in the party’s activities after the critical date, and that the evidence provided by the applicant was insufficient to refute this finding. Consequently, the court dismissed the applicant’s arguments to the effect that she was only formally a member of the CPL, did not participate in the meetings of its Central Committee for Supervision and Audit and that, accordingly, she could not be held to have “acted”, “been a militant” or “actively participated” (darboties) in the party’s activities. 41. The applicant appealed against this judgment to the Civil Division of the Supreme Court. On 12 November 1999 the Civil Division began examining the appeal. At the oral hearing, the applicant submitted that the content of the above-mentioned minutes of 26 January and 27 March 1991, referring to her by name, could not be held against her since on both those dates she had been carrying out her duties in the Latvian Supreme Council and not in the CPL. After hearing evidence from two witnesses who stated that the applicant had indeed been present at the Supreme Council, the Division suspended examination of the case in order to enable the applicant to submit more cogent evidence in support of her statements, such as a record of parliamentary debates or minutes of the Līdztiesība parliamentary bloc’s meetings. However, as the above-mentioned minutes had not been preserved by the Parliamentary Record Office, the applicant was never able to produce such evidence. 42. By a judgment of 15 December 1999, the Civil Division dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It stated that the evidence gathered by the Office of the Prosecutor General was sufficient to conclude that the applicant had actively taken part in the CPL’s activities after 13 January 1991. The Division further noted that the CPL’s dissolution had been ordered “in accordance with the interests of the Latvian State in a specific historical and political situation” and that the international conventions relied on by the applicant allowed for justified limitations on the exercise of electoral rights. 43. Following the Civil Division’s judgment, enforceable from the date of its delivery, the applicant was disqualified from electoral office and lost her seat as a member of Riga City Council. 44. The applicant applied to the Senate of the Supreme Court to have the Civil Division’s judgment quashed. She stressed, inter alia, the restriction’s incompatibility with Article 11 of the Convention. By a final order of 7 February 2000 the Senate declared the appeal inadmissible. In the Senate’s opinion, the proceedings in question were limited to a single strictly-defined objective, namely a finding as to whether or not the applicant had actively taken part in the CPL’s activities after 13 January 1991. The Senate concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to analyse the legal consequences of this finding, on the ground that this was irrelevant to the finding itself. In addition, the Senate noted that any such analysis would involve an examination of the Latvian legislation’s compatibility with constitutional and international law, which did not come within the final appeal court’s jurisdiction. 45. Proceedings similar to those against the applicant were also instituted against a small number of other CPL activists, not all of whom were recognised by the courts as having “actively participated” in the activities of the CPL after January 1991. 46. The next parliamentary elections took place on 5 October 2002. With a view to taking part in those elections, the Līdztiesība party, chaired by the applicant, formed an alliance entitled “For Human Rights in a United Latvia” (Par cilvēka tiesībām vienotā Latvijā, abbreviated to PCTVL) with two other parties, the Party of National Harmony and the Socialist Party. The alliance’s electoral manifesto expressly referred to the need to abolish the restrictions on the electoral rights of persons who had been actively involved in the CPL after 13 January 1991. 47. In spring 2002 the Executive Council of the Līdztiesība party put the applicant forward as a candidate for the 2002 elections; the Council of the PCTVL alliance approved this nomination. Shortly afterwards, however, on 16 May 2002, the outgoing parliament rejected a motion to repeal section 5(6) of the Parliamentary Elections Act. The alliance’s council, which was fully aware of the applicant’s situation and feared that her candidacy would prevent registration of the PCTVL’s entire list, changed its opinion and decided not to include her name on the list of candidates. The applicant then decided to submit a separate list containing only one name, her own, entitled “Party of National Harmony”. 48. On 23 July 2002 the PCTVL electoral alliance submitted its list to the Central Electoral Commission. In all, it contained the names of seventy-seven candidates for Latvia’s five constituencies. On the same date the applicant asked the commission to register her own list, for the constituency of Kurzeme alone. As she had done for the 1998 elections, she attached to her list a written statement to the effect that the disputed restrictions were incompatible with the Constitution and with Latvia’s international undertakings. On 25 July 2002 the commission registered both lists. 49. By a decision of 7 August 2002, the Central Electoral Commission, referring to the Civil Division’s judgment of 15 December 1999, removed the applicant from its list. In addition, having noted that the applicant had been the only candidate on the “Party of National Harmony” list and that, following her removal, there were no other names, the commission decided to cancel the registration of that list. 50. At the elections of 5 October 2002, the PCTVL alliance’s list obtained 18.94% of the votes and won twenty-five seats in Parliament. 51. Latvia became a member of the European Union on 1 May 2004. Prior to that date, on the basis of the European Parliament Elections Act (Eiropas Parlamenta vēlēšanu likums) of 12 February 2004, the applicant was granted permission to run in those elections. They were held on 12 June 2004 and the applicant was elected as a member of the European Parliament. 52. The operative provisions of the Declaration of 4 May 1990 on the Restoration of the Independence of the Republic of Latvia read as follows: “The Supreme Council of the Latvian SSR decides: (1) in recognition of the supremacy of international law over the provisions of national law, to consider illegal the Pact of 23 August 1939 between the USSR and Germany and the subsequent liquidation of the sovereignty of the Republic of Latvia through the USSR’s military aggression on 17 June 1940; (2) to declare null and void the Declaration by the Parliament [Saeima] of Latvia, adopted on 21 July 1940, on Latvia’s integration into the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; (3) to restore the legal effect of the Constitution [Satversme] of the Republic of Latvia, adopted on 15 February 1922 by the Constituent Assembly [Satversmes sapulce], throughout the entire territory of Latvia. The official name of the Latvian State shall be the REPUBLIC of LATVIA, abbreviated to LATVIA; (4) to suspend the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia pending the adoption of a new version of the Constitution, with the exception of those Articles which define the constitutional and legal foundation of the Latvian State and which, in accordance with Article 77 of the same Constitution, may only be amended by referendum, namely: Article 1 – Latvia is an independent and democratic republic. Article 2 – The sovereign power of the State of Latvia is vested in the Latvian people. Article 3 – The territory of the State of Latvia, as established by international agreements, consists of Vidzeme, Latgale, Kurzeme and Zemgale. Article 6 – Parliament [Saeima] shall be elected in general, equal, direct and secret elections, based on proportional representation. Article 6 of the Constitution shall be applied after the restoration of the State and administrative structures of the independent Republic of Latvia, which will guarantee free elections; (5) to introduce a transition period for the re-establishment of the Republic of Latvia’s de facto sovereignty, which will end with the convening of the Parliament of the Republic of Latvia. During the transition period, supreme power shall be exercised by the Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia; (6) during the transition period, to accept the application of those constitutional and other legal provisions of the Latvian SSR which are in force in the territory of the Latvian SSR when the present Declaration is adopted, in so far as those provisions do not contradict Articles 1, 2, 3 and 6 of the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia. Disputes on matters relating to the application of legislative texts will be referred to the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Latvia. During the transition period, only the Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia shall adopt new legislation or amend existing legislation; (7) to set up a commission to draft a new version of the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia that will correspond to the current political, economic and social situation in Latvia; (8) to guarantee social, economic and cultural rights, as well as universally recognised political freedoms compatible with international instruments of human rights, to citizens of the Republic of Latvia and citizens of other States permanently residing in Latvia. This shall apply to citizens of the USSR who wish to live in Latvia without acquiring Latvian nationality; (9) to base relations between the Republic of Latvia and the USSR on the Peace Treaty of 11 August 1920 between Latvia and Russia, which is still in force and which recognises the independence of the Latvian State for all time. A governmental commission shall be set up to conduct the negotiations with the USSR.” 53. The operative provisions of the Constitutional Law of 21 August 1991 on the status of the Republic of Latvia as a State (Konstitucionālais likums “Par Latvijas Republikas valstisko statusu”) read as follows: “The Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia decides: (1) to declare that Latvia is an independent and democratic republic in which the sovereign power of the State of Latvia belongs to the Latvian people, the status of which as a State is defined by the Constitution of 15 February 1922; (2) to repeal paragraph 5 of the Declaration of 4 May 1990 on the Restoration of the Independence of the Republic of Latvia, establishing a transition period for the de facto restoration of the Republic of Latvia’s State sovereignty; (3) until such time as the occupation and annexation is ended and Parliament is convened, supreme State power in the Republic of Latvia shall be fully exercised by the Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia. Only those laws and decrees enacted by the supreme governing and administrative authorities of the Republic of Latvia shall be in force in its territory; (4) this constitutional law shall enter into force on the date of its enactment.” 54. The role of the CPSU in the former Soviet Union was defined in Article 6 of the Constitution of the USSR (1977) and in Article 6 of the Constitution of the Latvian SSR (1978), which were worded along identical lines. Those provisions stated: “The leading and guiding force of Soviet society and the nucleus of its political system and of all State organisations and public organisations is the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The CPSU exists for the people and serves the people. The Communist Party, armed with Marxism-Leninism, determines the general perspectives of the development of society and the course of the USSR’s domestic and foreign policy, directs the great constructive work of the Soviet people, and imparts a planned, systematic and theoretically substantiated character to their struggle for the victory of communism. All party organisations shall function within the framework of the Constitution of the USSR.” 55. The Supreme Council’s decision of 24 August 1991 on the suspension of the activities of certain non-governmental and political organisations was worded as follows: “On 20 August 1991 the Internationalist Front of Workers of the Latvian SSR, the United Council of Labour Collectives, the Republican Council of War and Labour Veterans, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Latvia and the Central Committee of the Latvian Union of Communist Youth issued a proclamation informing the Republic’s population that a state of emergency had been decreed in Latvia and encouraging all private individuals to oppose those who did not submit to the orders of the National State of Emergency Committee. In so doing, the above-mentioned organisations ... declared their support for the organisers of the coup d’état and encouraged other individuals to do the same. The actions of those organisations are contrary to Articles 4, 6 and 49 of the Latvian Constitution, which state that Latvian citizens are entitled to form parties and other associations only if their objectives and practical activities are not aimed at the violent transformation or overthrow of the existing constitutional order ... and that associations must observe the Constitution and legislation and act in accordance with their provisions. The Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia decrees: 1. The activities of the Communist Party of Latvia [and of the other above-mentioned organisations] are hereby suspended ...” 56. The relevant parts of the Supreme Council’s decision of 10 September 1991 on the dissolution of the above-mentioned organisations read as follows: “... In May 1990 the Communist Party of Latvia, the Internationalist Front of Workers of the Latvian SSR, the United Council of Labour Collectives and the Republican Council of War and Labour Veterans set up the Committee for the Defence of the Constitution of the USSR and the Latvian SSR and the Rights of Citizens, which was renamed the Latvian Public Rescue Committee on 25 November 1990 ... On 15 January 1991 the Latvian Public Rescue Committee declared that it was seizing power and dissolving the Supreme Council and the Government of the Republic of Latvia. In August 1991 the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Latvia [and the other above-mentioned organisations] supported the coup ... Having regard to the preceding, the Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia decrees: 1. The Communist Party of Latvia [and the other above-mentioned organisations], together with the coalition of these organisations, the Latvian Public Rescue Committee, are hereby dissolved on the ground that they have acted against the Constitution ... 2. Former members of the Communist Party of Latvia [and of the other above-mentioned organisations] are informed that they are entitled to associate within parties and other associations whose objectives and practical activities are not aimed at the violent transformation or overthrow of the existing constitutional order, and which are not otherwise contrary to the Constitution and the laws of the Republic of Latvia ...” 57. The relevant provisions of the Constitution (Satversme) of the Republic of Latvia, adopted in 1922 and amended by the Law of 15 October 1998, are worded as follows: “All citizens of Latvia who enjoy full civic rights and who have reached the age of 21 on the day of the elections may be elected to Parliament.” “Legislative power lies with Parliament and with the people, in the conditions and to the extent provided for by this Constitution.” “All persons in Latvia shall be equal before the law and the courts. Human rights shall be exercised without discrimination of any kind.” “All citizens of Latvia are entitled to participate, in accordance with the law, in the activities of the State and of local government ...” 58. The relevant provisions of the Parliamentary Elections Act (Saeimas vēlēšanu likums) of 25 May 1995 provide: “All Latvian citizens who have reached the age of 21 on the date of the elections may be elected to Parliament, on condition that they are not concerned by one of the restrictions provided for in section 5 of the present Act.” “The following may not stand as candidates in elections or be elected to Parliament: ... (6) persons who actively participated [darbojušās] after 13 January 1991 in the CPSU (CPL), the Internationalist Front of Workers of the Latvian SSR, the United Council of Labour Collectives, the Organisation of War and Labour Veterans or the Latvian Public Rescue Committee, or in their regional committees; ...” “The following documents must be appended to the list of candidates: ... (3) a signed declaration by each candidate on the list confirming that he or she meets the requirements of section 4 of this Act and that he or she is not concerned by section 5(1)-(6) of the present Act; ...” “... (2) Once registered, the candidate lists are definitive, and the Central Electoral Commission may make only the following corrections: 1. removal of a candidate from the list, where: ... (a) the candidate is not a citizen enjoying full civic rights (sections 4 and 5 above); ... (3) ... [A] candidate shall be removed from the list on the basis of a statement from the relevant authority or of a court decision. The fact that the candidate: ... 6. actively participated after 13 January 1991 in the CPSU (CPL), the Internationalist Front of Workers of the Latvian SSR, the United Council of Labour Collectives, the Organisation of War and Labour Veterans or the Latvian Public Rescue Committee, or in their regional committees, shall be attested by a judgment of the relevant court; ...” 59. The Law of 13 January 1994 on elections to municipal councils and city councils (Pilsētas domes un pagasta padomes vēlēšanu likums) contains similar provisions to the provisions of the Parliamentary Elections Act cited above. In particular, section 9(5) is identical to section 5(6) of that Act. 60. The procedure for obtaining a judicial statement attesting to an individual’s participation or non-participation in the above-mentioned organisations is governed by Chapter 23-A of the Code of Civil Procedure (Civilprocesa kodekss), which was inserted by a law of 3 September 1998 and is entitled “Examination of cases concerning the attestation of restrictions on electoral rights”. The provisions of that chapter read as follows: “A request for a statement of restriction on electoral rights may be submitted by the prosecutor ... The request must be submitted to the court in whose territorial jurisdiction is situated the home of the person in respect of whom the attestation of a restriction on electoral rights is requested. The request may be submitted where an electoral commission has registered a list of candidates which includes ... a citizen in respect of whom there is evidence that, subsequent to 13 January 1991, he or she actively participated in the CPSU (in the CPL) ... A request concerning a person included in the list of candidates may also be submitted once the elections have taken place. The request must be accompanied by a statement from the electoral commission confirming that the person in question has stood as a candidate in elections and that the list in question has been registered, as well as by evidence confirming the allegations made in the request.” “After examining the request, the court shall give its judgment: (1) finding that, after 13 January 1991, the person concerned did actively participate in the CPSU (in the CPL) ...; (2) declaring the request ill-founded and dismissing it ...” 61. The Parliamentary Elections Act was enacted on 25 May 1995 by the first parliament elected after the restoration of Latvia’s independence, otherwise known as the “Fifth Legislature” (the first four legislatures having operated between 1922 and 1934). The following legislature (the Sixth), elected in October 1995, examined three different proposals seeking to repeal section 5(6) of the above-mentioned Act. At the plenary session of 9 October 1997, the three proposals were rejected by large majorities after lengthy debates. Likewise, on 18 December 1997, during a debate on a proposal to restrict section 5(6), the provision’s current wording was confirmed. Elected in October 1998, the following legislature (the Seventh) examined a proposal to repeal section 5(6) at a plenary session on 16 May 2002. After lengthy discussions, the majority of members of parliament refused to accept the proposal. Finally, the Eighth Legislature, elected in October 2002, examined a similar proposal on 15 January 2004. It was also rejected. 62. In a judgment of 30 August 2000 in case no. 2000-03-01, the Constitutional Court (Satversmes tiesa) found that the restrictions imposed by section 5(6) of the Parliamentary Elections Act and section 9(5) of the Municipal Elections Act were compatible with the Latvian Constitution and with Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. In that judgment, adopted by four votes to three, the Constitutional Court first reiterated the general principles laid down in the settled case-law of the Convention institutions in applying Article 14 of the Convention and Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. It further held: “4. The argument that the provisions complained of, forbidding certain Latvian citizens from standing as candidates or being elected to Parliament and municipal councils, discriminate against them on the basis of their political allegiance is without foundation ... The impugned provisions do not provide for a difference in treatment on the basis of an individual’s political convictions (opinions) but for a restriction on electoral rights for having acted against the re-established democratic order after 13 January 1991 ... Accordingly, Parliament limited the restrictions to the degree of each individual’s personal responsibility [individuālās atbildības pakāpe] in carrying out those organisations’ objectives and programmes, and the restriction on the right to be elected to Parliament or to a municipal council ... is related to the specific individual’s activities in the respective ... associations. In itself, formal membership of the above-mentioned organisations cannot serve as a basis for preventing an individual from standing as candidate or being elected to Parliament ... Consequently, the impugned provisions are directed only against those who attempted, subsequent to 13 January 1991 and in the presence of the army of occupation, to re-establish the former regime through active participation [ar aktīvu darbību]; on the other hand, they do not affect persons who have differing political convictions (opinions). The tendency of certain courts to concentrate solely on the finding of the fact of formal membership and not to evaluate the person’s behaviour is inconsistent with the objectives sought by Parliament in enacting the provision in issue ... 6. ... Given that those organisations’ objectives were linked to the overthrow of the existing State regime [pastāvošās valsts iekārtas graušana], they were essentially unconstitutional ... Consequently, the aim of the restrictions on passive electoral rights is to protect the democratic State order, national security and territorial integrity of Latvia. The impugned provisions are not directed against pluralism of ideas in Latvia or against a person’s political opinions, but against those who, through their active participation, have attempted to overthrow the democratic State order ... The exercise of human rights may not be directed against democracy as such ... The substance and effectiveness of law is demonstrated in its ethical nature [ētiskums]. A democratic society has a legitimate interest in requiring loyalty to democracy from its political representatives. In establishing restrictions, the candidates’ honour and reputation is not challenged, in the sense of personal legal benefit [personisks tiesisks labums]; what is challenged is the worthiness of the persons in question to represent the people in Parliament or in the relevant municipal council. These restrictions concern persons who were permanent agents of the occupying power’s repressive regime, or who, after 13 January 1991, participated in the organisations mentioned in the impugned provisions and actively fought against the re-established Latvian Constitution and State ... The argument ... that democratic State order must be protected against individuals who are not ethically qualified to become representatives of a democratic State at political or administrative level ... is well-founded ... ... The removal from the list of a candidate who was involved in the above-mentioned organisations is not an arbitrary administrative decision; it is based on an individual judgment by a court. In accordance with the law, evaluation of individual responsibility comes under the jurisdiction of the courts ... 7. ... In order to determine whether the measure applied, namely the restrictions on passive electoral rights, is proportionate to the objectives being pursued, namely the protection, firstly, of democratic State order and, secondly, of the national security and integrity of the Latvian State, it is necessary to assess the political situation in the country and other related circumstances. Parliament having evaluated the historical and political circumstances of the development of democracy on several occasions ... the Court does not consider that at this stage there would be grounds for challenging the proportionality between the measure applied and its aim. However, Parliament, by periodically examining the political situation in the State and the necessity and merits of the restrictions, should decide to establish a time-limit on these restrictions ... since such limitations on passive electoral rights may exist only for a specific period.” 63. Three of the Constitutional Court’s seven judges who examined the above-mentioned case gave a dissenting opinion in which they expressed their disagreement with the majority’s conclusions. Referring, inter alia, to Vogt v. Germany (26 September 1995, Series A no. 323) and Rekvényi v. Hungary ([GC], no. 25390/94, ECHR 1999-III), they argued that the disputed restrictions could be more extensive with regard to civil servants than to elected representatives. According to those judges, Latvia’s democratic regime and institutional system had become sufficiently stable in the years since 1991 for individuals who had campaigned against the system ten years previously no longer to represent a real threat to the State. Consequently, the restriction on those persons’ electoral rights was not proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. 64. Prior to Latvia becoming a member of the European Union, the Latvian parliament adopted the European Parliament Elections Act (Eiropas Parlamenta vēlēšanu likums), which was enacted on 29 January 2004 and came into force on 12 February 2004. The Act contains no provision similar to section 5(6) of the Parliamentary Elections Act. Consequently, the applicant was free to stand as a candidate in the elections to the European Parliament.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
65,001-70236,ENG,GBR,ADMISSIBILITY,2005,O`LOUGHLIN AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,4,Inadmissible,Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza,"The applicants are, save for certain relatives of Antonio Magliocco who are Italian citizens, Irish nationals and represented by Mr G. O’Neill, a solicitor practising in Dublin. They are relatives of persons who were killed, or victims themselves of injuries caused, by bomb explosions in Dublin and Monaghan. The names and details of the applicants are contained in the case-file. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows. On 17 May 1974, four car bombs exploded without warning in the Republic of Ireland, killing thirty four people and injuring over two hundred. At about 5.30 p.m., three car bombs exploded within minutes of each other at three locations in Dublin, namely Parnell Street, Talbot Street and South Leinster Street. The fourth car bomb exploded 90 minutes later in Monaghan. The Irish authorities conducted extensive investigations. It was discovered that the cars used for the bombing were stolen in Belfast the same day. The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) conducted an investigation into the theft of the cars and related offences which did not produce any result. No murder inquiry was begun in Northern Ireland. Authorities on both sides of the border held suspicions that the events were carried out by loyalist paramilitaries. In July 1993, Yorkshire Television broadcast a documentary “Hidden Hand – the Forgotten Masssacre"" which raised concerns as to whether elements of the United Kingdom security forces were involved in the bombings. It alleged that the bombers included not only eight suspects (members of the UVF including David Mulholland and Samuel Whitten) but named in addition four planners, Billy Hanna, Robert Mc Donnell Harris Boyle and a loyalist killer known as the Jackal, not named for legal reasons, all of whom were former or serving members of the UDR. It was suggested that despite much early information in the investigation, the trail ran cold at RUC headquarters in Belfast. Enquiries into suspects had to be made through the RUC who did not report back. There was no evidence that the RUC had ever bothered to question or arrest the suspects. The programme included interviews inter alia with Fred Holroyd, an army officer who had in 1974 been working undercover for Army Intelligence and MI6, Colin Wallace, a senior army information officer in 1973-1975 and various explosives experts and suggested that the organising of the Dublin bombings had been beyond the limited loyalist expertise at the time and that they must have had assistance. It was further suggested that military intelligence had infiltrated the loyalist structures, that certain loyalists were working closely with intelligence in operations including acts of cross-border terrorism and that some of the explosive used in the Dublin bombings had been provided from security force sources Following the programme, relatives of the victims obtained from the Irish Minister of Justice a commitment that the Garda investigation into the bombings would be reviewed and any new evidence referred to in the documentary would be examined. In the Garda investigation which followed, police obtained the co-operation of the RUC and attended interviews of suspects in Northern Ireland, including Robin Jackson, Mulholland and Whitten. Interviews were also conducted with Fred Holroyd and Colin Wallace but they declined to make a statement and did not offer any evidence to support the allegations made during the programme. On 17 May 1995, the Irish Department of Justice issued a press release setting out conclusions reached in the review. It cast doubt on the credibility of the documentary. In January 1996, the relatives obtained the services of a solicitor and counsel, who reviewed the material and advised that there was insufficient evidence of any allegation of State wrongdoing to be advanced in respect of the bombings themselves. They advised that further evidence would have to be obtained and that such evidence could only be obtained by some form of public inquiry. They also advised that there was sufficient basis to lodge a complaint with the European Commission of Human Rights that the RUC had failed to conduct a murder inquiry into matters connected with the bombings in Dublin and Monaghan. An application, no. 36157/97, Patrick Doyle v. the United Kingdom brought by one of the relatives of the victims was rejected by the Court on 6 July 1999 for failure to comply with the six months time-limit (that is, the complaint had not been introduced within six months of the programme which had made the applicant aware of the alleged failure of the United Kingdom authorities to co-operate with the Irish authorities’ inquiry). On 16 June 1998, the Irish Government appointed a Victims’ Commission whose terms of reference included considerations of the needs and concerns of victims of major outrages including those of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. In August 1999, the Victim Commissioner’s Report recommended a private judicial inquiry. In early 1999, allegations by John Weir, a former RUC Sergeant who had served twelve years in prison for the murder of William Strathearn, were made public. He named persons allegedly involved in bombings and shootings, including the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and suggested that collusion between loyalist paramilitaries and certain elements in the security forces was taking place in the mid-1970s. Irish police officers interviewed him in April 1999 and he made a statement. In December 1999, the Irish Government agreed to establish a non-statutory Commission of Inquiry. Mr Justice Henry Barron was eventually appointed to head the inquiry and issue a report to the Government, after which a committee of the Irish Parliament would decide whether any further steps should be taken. The inquiry was informal, did not sit in public and had no legal powers. In December 2003, the inquiry report (""the Barron Report"") was made public. The inquiry had heard evidence, inter alia, from John Weir, Fred Holroyd, Colin Wallace and Irish police officers involved in the investigations. Weir named Hanna as the main organiser of the bombings and had claimed that explosives for all four bombs had been supplied by a named UDR officer. Weir had also named Laurence McClure, a RUC officer, as assembling the Dublin bombs. He did not claim that Army or intelligence contacts assisted Hanna and Jackson in planning the bombings. Written evidence before the inquiry included materials from the RUC who had carried out a number of interviews at the request of the Irish police, including James Mitchell, a constable in the RUC Reserve who owned the farm allegedly central to the activities of the group named by Weir, McClure and the UDR officer named by Weir as supplying explosives. They had all rejected the allegations. In his statement to the Joint Committee of the Irish Parliament, Mr Justice Barron stated that the inquiry was satisfied that it had received all relevant documentation from sources within the State. As regarded elsewhere, he noted that from the early stages the inquiry had received assurances of co-operation from the British Government and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). From its dealings with the RUC/PSNI, the Inquiry had received a considerable amount of information, including records of the questioning in December 1978 of RUC officers suspected of participating in attacks on Catholic civilians as well as ballistics evidence. There had been considerable delay in obtaining information from the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. The inquiry was told that this was because there were some 68,000 files of possible relevance in the Northern Ireland Office alone, while files in the Ministry of Defence could be counted in the millions. The teams examining these files were stated to have finished at the end of 2001. On 26 February 2002, a ten page letter was sent by the Secretary of State containing the promised information. An appendix of six pages gave details of the structure and control of intelligence gathering at the relevant time. No copies of original documents had been provided. Further requests for specific information did produce some additional information in a similar form. ""Correspondence with the Northern Ireland Office undoubtedly produced some useful information; but its value was reduced by reluctance to make original documents available and the refusal to make other information available on security grounds. While the Inquiry fully understands the position taken by the British Government on these matters, it must be said that the scope of this report is limited as a result."" The inquiry summarised its conclusions as follows: ""The facts, circumstances, causes and perpetrators of the bombs: The Dublin and Monaghan bombings were carried out by two groups of loyalist paramilitaries, one based in Belfast and the other in the area around Portadown/Lurgan. Most, though not all of those involved were members of the UVF (Ulster Volunteer Force). It is likely that the bombings were conceived and planned in Belfast, with the mid-Ulster element providing operational assistance. The bombings were primarily a reaction to the Sunningdale Agreement – in particular to the prospect of a greater role for the Irish Government in the administration of Northern Ireland – though there were other specific events in April and May 1974 which might have influenced the attacks. The loyalist groups who carried out the bombings in Dublin were capable of doing so without help from any section of the security forces in Northern Ireland, though this does not rule out the involvement of individual RUC, UDR or British army members. The Monaghan bombing in particular bears all the hallmarks of a standard loyalist operation and required no assistance. It is likely that James Mitchell at Glenanne played a significant part in the preparation for the attacks. It is also likely that members of the UDR and RUC either participated in, or were aware of those preparations. The nature, extent and adequacy of the Garda investigation, including the co-operation with and from the relevant authorities in Northern Ireland and the handling of evidence, including the scientific analyses of forensic evidence: The Garda investigation failed to make full use of the information which it obtained. Certain lines of inquiry that could have been pursued in this jurisdiction were not pursued. There were other matters, including the questioning of suspects, in which the assistance of the RUC should have been requested, but was not. The State was not equipped to conduct an adequate forensic analysis of the explosions. This was because the importance of the preservation, prompt collection and analysis was not appreciated. The effect of this was that potentially vital clues were lost. Although the investigation teams had in their opinion no evidence upon which to found a prosecution, there is no evidence that they sought the advice of the Attorney General, in whose name criminal prosecutions were at that time still being brought. Had the Attorney General reviewed the file, it is likely that advice would have been given as to what further direction the investigation might take. The reasons why no prosecution took place, including whether and if so, by whom and to what extent the investigations were impeded: A number of those suspected for the bombings were reliably said to have had relationships with British Intelligence and/or RUC Special Branch officers. It is reasonable to assume that exchanges of information took place. It is therefore possible that the assistance provided to the Garda investigation team by the security forces in Northern Ireland was affected by a reluctance to compromise those relationships, in the interests of securing further information in the future. But any such conclusion would require very cogent evidence. No such evidence is in the possession of the Inquiry. There remains a deep suspicion that the investigation into the bombings was hampered by such factors, but it cannot be put further than that. There is evidence which shows that the informal exchange of information between the Garda on the border and their RUC counterparts was extensive. There is some evidence to suggest that some Garda officers, unwittingly or otherwise, may have been giving information to the members of the British Army or Intelligence Services. The Inquiry has found no evidence to support the proposition that such exchanges in some way facilitated the passage of the Dublin and Monaghan bombers across the border. Similarly, no basis has been found for concluding that the Garda investigation was in any way inhibited because of a fear of exposing such links. The Inquiry has examined allegations that the Garda investigation was wound down as a result of political interference. No evidence was found to support that proposition. However, it can be said that the Government of the day showed little interest in the bombings. When information was given to them suggesting that the British authorities had intelligence naming the bombers, this was not followed up. Any follow-up was limited to complaints by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that those involved had been released from internment. The issues raised by the ‘Hidden Hand’ TV. documentary broadcast in 1993: There is no evidence that any branch of the security forces knew in advance that the bombings were about to take place. This has been reiterated by the current Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and is accepted by the Inquiry. If they did know, it is unlikely that there would be any official records. Such knowledge would not have been written down; or if it was, would not have been in any files made available to the Secretary of State. There is evidence that the Secretary of State of the day was not fully informed on matters of which he should have been made aware. On that basis, it is equally probable that similarly sensitive information might be withheld from the present holder of that office. The Inquiry believes that within a short time of the bombings taking place, the security forces in Northern Ireland had good intelligence to suggest who was responsible. An example of this could be the unknown intelligence that led British Intelligence sources to tell their Irish Army counterparts that at least two of the bombers had been arrested on 26 May and detained. Unfortunately, the Inquiry has been unable to discover the nature of this and other intelligence available to the security forces in Northern Ireland at that time. As is made clear in the Report, there are grounds for suspecting that the bombers may have had assistance from members of the security forces. The involvement of individual members in such an activity does not of itself mean the bombings were either officially or unofficially state-sanctioned. If one accepts that some people were involved, they may well have been acting on their own initiative. Ultimately, a finding that there was collusion between the perpetrators and the authorities in Northern Ireland is a matter of inference. On some occasions an inference is irresistible or can be drawn as a matter of probability. Here, it is the view of the Inquiry that this inference is not sufficiently strong. It does not follow even as a matter of probability. Unless further information comes to hand, such involvement must remain a suspicion. It is not proven."" In January-March 2004, hearings on the report took place before the Sub-Committee of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women’s Rights. The Joint Committee issued its final report on 31 March 2004, making a number of recommendations, inter alia, that a Commission of Investigation be set up in respect of identified concerns about the Garda investigation (the reason it was wound down in 1974 and did not pursue certain leads) and missing documentation from police, intelligence and Department of Justice files. As regarded external issues of collusion, the Committee noted that Mr Justice Barron had requested assistance from the Great Britain and Northern Ireland authorities and that he was furnished with a sixteen page summary of any relevant information on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings which had resulted from a trawl of their files. The Committee had invited former and current ministers and officers from Great Britain and Northern Ireland to make oral or written submissions to elaborate on this document and any other relevant matters but these invitations were declined. It stated: ""The Sub-Committee wishes to express its grave disappointment at the response received to these invitations. An examination of the Northern Ireland and Great Britain records from the time in question would be necessary for any examination of this area. However, neither the Sub-Committee nor Mr Justice Barron were afforded the co-operation which the gravity of the atrocity required.” It took the view that the information received by it had reinforced suspicion of collusion between security forces and loyalist groups in Northern Ireland and that further extensive investigation was required. It noted the self-evident problems that arose since potentially relevant information and witnesses were outside the jurisdiction and access to these sources in United Kingdom and Northern Ireland were vital. It concluded that a Public Tribunal of Inquiry in Northern Ireland or Great Britain was required, presided over by a judge of international standing and with powers to summon witnesses and compel disclosure of documents, and that in the event of a lack of co-operation from the United Kingdom in that respect the Irish Government should consider instituting proceedings before the Court in Strasbourg. Meanwhile, the lawyers acting for the relatives in ""Justice for the Forgotten"" discovered that the inquests into the death of those who had died in the bombings in 1974 had been adjourned. In 1999 the Dublin City Coroner agreed that the inquests should proceed once the inquiry report had issued. The inquests took place in April and May 2004 and issued findings of unlawful killing.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Villeurbanne. 6. Zina Hind was born on 3 November 2003 in Algeria and was abandoned immediately by her biological mother, who gave birth anonymously. As her father was also unknown, Zina Hind became a ward of the Algerian State on 3 December 2003. The director of social services in Boumerdès (Algeria) was appointed as her guardian. 7. On 13 January 2004 the President of the court of Boumerdès granted the applicant, then aged 42 and unmarried, the right to take the child Zina Hind into her legal care (kafala). He also authorised Zina Hind to leave Algeria and settle in France. 8. In a decision of 19 January 2004, the President of the court of Bordj Menaïel (Algeria) admitted a request for the child to take the same name and authorised the change from Zina Hind to Hind Harroudj. 9. Hind Harroudj arrived in France on 1 February 2004. Since then she has been living with the applicant and the applicant’s mother. 10. On 8 November 2006 the applicant applied for the full adoption of Hind. In support of her request she argued that to enable Hind to be adopted was the solution most consistent with “the best interests of the child”, within the meaning of Article 3 § 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989 and Article 1 of the Hague Convention of 29 May 1993 on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. 11. In a judgment of 21 March 2007 the Lyons tribunal de grande instance dismissed her application for adoption, after noting that kafala gave her parental authority, enabling her to take any decisions in the child’s interest. The court found that kafala gave the child the protection to which all children were entitled under the international conventions. It further pointed out that, under Article 370-3 of the French Civil Code (see paragraph 23 below), a child could not be adopted if the law of his or her country prohibited adoption, which it did in the case of Hind, as the Algerian Family Code stipulated: “adoption is prohibited by the Sharia and by legislation” (see paragraph 17 below). The applicant appealed against that judgment. 12. In a judgment of 23 October 2007 the Lyons Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the court below: “Article 370-3, second paragraph, of the Civil Code, inserted by the Law of 6 February 2001 on Intercountry Adoption, stipulates: ‘Adoption of a foreign minor may not be ordered where his or her personal law prohibits that institution, unless the minor was born and resides habitually in France’. The choice-of-law rule, in so far as it refers to the personal law, is not discriminatory and is compliant with Articles 8 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights and with international law; Article 4 (a) of the Hague Convention of 29 May 1993 on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption provides that adoption may take place only if the competent authorities of the State of origin have established that the child is adoptable, this not being the case where adoption is prohibited. Hind Harroudj was born in Algeria. Article 46 of the Algerian Family Code authorises kafala, but prohibits adoption. Under French law, simple or full adoption creates a legal parent-child relationship for the benefit of the adopters and cannot be equated with kafala. The Algerian Family Code does not provide for any exception to the prohibition of adoption where the child has no established parentage. The executive decree of 13 January 1992 on changes of name does not establish parent-child relationships, as the holder of the right of kafala retains the status of guardian. The kafala system preserves the child’s interests by conferring legal status on the care provided by guardians. It is expressly recognised by Article 20 § 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989. Islamic law makes other provision for the inheritance of property. Accordingly, the above-mentioned provisions do not run counter to the child’s best interests.” 13. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. Under Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention, she relied on Hind’s right to respect for her family life, submitting that it was in the child’s interest for a legal parent-child relationship to be established between them, and that her inability to adopt Hind entailed a disproportionate interference with her own family life. She argued that the fact of denying her the right to adopt had the effect of establishing a difference in treatment in respect of the child’s family life on account of the child’s nationality and country of origin, as children born in countries which did not prohibit adoption could be adopted in France. 14. In a judgment of 25 February 2009 the Court of Cassation dismissed her appeal on points of law: “After noting that the choice-of-law rule in Article 370-3, second paragraph, of the Civil Code, referring to the personal law of the adopted child, was consistent with the Hague Convention of 29 May 1993 on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption – the application of which is intended only for adoptable children, excluding those whose country of origin prohibits adoption – the Court of Appeal did not establish any difference in treatment in respect of the child’s family life or disregard the right to respect for the latter, in finding that Article 46 of the Algerian Family Code prohibited adoption but authorised kafala and in rejecting the application for adoption, in so far as kafala was expressly recognised by Article 20, paragraph 3, of the New York Convention of 26 January 1990 [adopted on 20 November 1989] on the Rights of the Child, as preserving, on a par with adoption, the child’s best interests. ...” 15. Adoption, emanating from classical Roman law, which based it on the “imitation of nature” (the principle of adoptio naturam imitatur in the Institutes of Justinian) creates, between the adopter and the adoptee, a legal relationship that is identical to that existing between parent and child. Although certain States make a distinction between several levels of adoption (most often between full adoption and simple adoption), this characteristic is always present. 16. Under Islamic law adoption is prohibited (haraam). However, the right is accorded a special institution: kafala or “legal care”. In Muslim States, with the exception of Turkey, Indonesia and Tunisia, kafala is defined as a voluntary undertaking to provide for a child and take care of his or her welfare, education and protection. 17. The procedural arrangements for establishing kafala depend on the domestic law of each Muslim State. The relevant provisions of the Algerian Family Code thus read as follows: “Adoption (tabanni) is prohibited by the Sharia and by legislation.” “Kafala is an undertaking to assume responsibility for supporting, educating and protecting a minor child in the same manner as a father would care for his son. It is established by a legal act.” “Kafala is granted upon appearance before the judge or notary, with the child’s consent when he or she has a father and mother.” “The holder of the right of kafala (the kafil) must be a Muslim, a sensible and upright person, and be in a position to support the fostered child (the makfoul), with the capacity to protect him or her.” “The fostered child may be of known or unknown parentage.” “The fostered child shall retain his or her original legal parent-child relationship if of known parentage. Otherwise, Article 64 of the Civil Status Code shall be applied in respect of the child.” “Should the father and mother, or one of them, request the reinstatement under their guardianship of the fostered child, it will be for the child, provided he or she is of an age of discernment, to choose whether or not to return to his parents. If the child is not of such an age, he may be returned only with the judge’s authorisation, taking into account the interests of the fostered child.” 18. Articles 20 and 21 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, of 20 November 1989, read as follows: “1. A child temporarily or permanently deprived of his or her family environment, or in whose own best interests cannot be allowed to remain in that environment, shall be entitled to special protection and assistance provided by the State. 2. States Parties shall in accordance with their national laws ensure alternative care for such a child. 3. Such care could include, inter alia, foster placement, Kafala of Islamic law, adoption, or if necessary placement in suitable institutions for the care of children. When considering solutions, due regard shall be paid to the desirability of continuity in a child’s upbringing and to the child’s ethnic, religious, cultural and linguistic background.” “States Parties that recognize and/or permit the system of adoption shall ensure that the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration ...” 19. The relevant provisions of the Hague Convention of 29 May 1993 on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, adopted in the context of the Hague Conference on Private International Law, read as follows: “The States signatory to the present Convention, Recognising that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding, ... Recognising that intercountry adoption may offer the advantage of a permanent family to a child for whom a suitable family cannot be found in his or her State of origin, Convinced of the necessity to take measures to ensure that intercountry adoptions are made in the best interests of the child and with respect for his or her fundamental rights, and to prevent the abduction, the sale of, or traffic in children, ... Have agreed upon the following provisions” “The objects of the present Convention are - (a) to establish safeguards to ensure that intercountry adoptions take place in the best interests of the child and with respect for his or her fundamental rights as recognised in international law; ... (c) to secure the recognition in Contracting States of adoptions made in accordance with the Convention.” “... 2. The Convention covers only adoptions which create a permanent parent-child relationship.” “An adoption within the scope of the Convention shall take place only if the competent authorities of the State of origin - (a) have established that the child is adoptable; (b) have determined, after possibilities for placement of the child within the State of origin have been given due consideration, that an intercountry adoption is in the child’s best interests; ...” 20. The relevant provisions of the Convention of 19 October 1996 on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-Operation in Respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children, also adopted in the context of the Hague Conference on Private International Law, read as follows: “(1) The objects of the present Convention are - (a) to determine the State whose authorities have jurisdiction to take measures directed to the protection of the person or property of the child; (b) to determine which law is to be applied by such authorities in exercising their jurisdiction; (c) to determine the law applicable to parental responsibility; (d) to provide for the recognition and enforcement of such measures of protection in all Contracting States; (e) to establish such co-operation between the authorities of the Contracting States as may be necessary in order to achieve the purposes of this Convention. (2) For the purposes of this Convention, the term ‘parental responsibility’ includes parental authority, or any analogous relationship of authority determining the rights, powers and responsibilities of parents, guardians or other legal representatives in relation to the person or the property of the child.” “The measures referred to in Article 1 may deal in particular with – ... (c) guardianship, curatorship and analogous institutions; (d) the designation and functions of any person or body having charge of the child’s person or property, representing or assisting the child; (e) the placement of the child in a foster family or in institutional care, or the provision of care by kafala or an analogous institution; ...” “The Convention does not apply to - ... (b) decisions on adoption, measures preparatory to adoption, or the annulment or revocation of adoption; ...” 21. Out of the twenty-two Contracting States of which a comparative law study has been made (Albania, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Denmark, Finland, “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia”, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine and the United Kingdom), where, as a result of historical factors, either the majority of the population is traditionally Muslim or there are sufficiently large Muslim communities, none of them regard kafala established abroad as adoption. In cases where the domestic courts have recognised the effects of kafala granted in a foreign country, they have always treated it as a form of guardianship or curatorship, or as placement with a view to adoption. 23. Law no. 2001-111 of 6 February 2001 inserted new provisions in the Civil Code concerning intercountry adoption, including the new Article 3703 in Chapter III (Choice-of-law rule concerning the legal parent-child relationship established by adoption and the effect in France of adoptions granted abroad) in Title VIII on legal parent-child relationships by adoption. The Article reads as follows: “The requirements for adoption are governed by the national law of the adopter or, in case of adoption by two spouses, by the law which governs the effects of their marital relationship. Adoption, however, may not be granted where it is prohibited by the national laws of both spouses. Adoption of a foreign minor may not be ordered where his or her personal law prohibits that institution, unless the minor was born and resides habitually in France ...” 24. Law no. 2003-1119 of 26 November 2003 on immigration control, foreign residents in France and nationality amended Article 21-12 of the Civil Code, concerning acquisition of French nationality by declaration. It now reads as follows: “A child who was the subject of a simple adoption by a person of French nationality may, until the age of majority, declare, in the manner provided for in Articles 26 et seq. hereof, that he opts for the status of French national, provided he resides in France at the time of his declaration. However, the obligation of residence is dispensed with where the child was adopted by a French national who does not have his habitual residence in France. The following may also opt for French nationality under the same conditions: 1o A child who, for at least five years, has been in foster care in France and brought up by a French national or who, for at least three years, has been entrusted to the child welfare service. 2o A child in foster care in France and brought up in conditions that have allowed him to receive, for at least five years, a French education, from either a public body, or a private body satisfying the characteristics determined by a decree issued after consultation of the Conseil d’Etat.” 25. Decree no 93-1362 of 30 December 1993 pertaining to declarations of nationality, and to decisions of naturalisation, redintegration, and of loss, forfeiture and withdrawal of French nationality (amended by decree no. 2010-527 of 20 May 2010) reads as follows: “In order to make the declaration provided for in Article 21-12 of the Civil Code, the applicant shall provide the following documents: ... (4) Where the applicant is a child who has been fostered in France and raised by a French national, the certificate of French nationality, civil registration certificates, any documents emanating from the French authorities that show the said foster parent has French nationality and any document proving that the child was placed in foster care in France and has been raised by that person for at least five years; ...” 26. Before the Law of 6 February 2001, the ordinary courts and the Court of Cassation had adopted a flexible position, allowing the conversion of kafala into adoption subject to the consent of the minor’s representative “having regard to the effects attached by French law to adoption and, in particular, in the case of full adoption, to the complete and irrevocable nature of the severance of the relationship between the minor and his blood relatives or the guardianship authorities of his country of origin” (Court of Cassation, First Civil Division, 10 May 1995, no. 93-17634). Following the enactment of the law, the Court of Cassation changed its position, quashing the judgments of courts of appeal which had granted simple adoption in respect of Moroccan and Algerian children in the kafala care of French couples (Court of Cassation, First Civil Division, 10 October 2006, no. 06-15264 and no. 06-15265). That solution has remained constant since then (see, for example, Court of Cassation, First Civil Division, 9 July 2008, no. 07-20279; Court of Cassation, First Civil Division, 28 January 2009, no. 0810034; and more recently, Court of Cassation, First Civil Division, 15 December 2010, no. 0910439). 27. In reports of 2004 and 2005, and in an opinion of 2007, the Children’s Advocate and the High Council for Adoption drew attention to the administrative difficulties encountered for the fostered child (access to visas, welfare rights) as a result of the lack of a legal parent-child relationship with the foster parent and to the difficulties of acquiring nationality. The report on adoption by J.-M. Colombani, deposited on 19 March 2008, noted that any evolution of the legal aspects of the situation appeared difficult and proposed cooperation with the two main countries concerned (Algeria and Morocco) especially with a view to adapting the conditions for the granting of a visa on a family reunification basis. The report explained that the Franco-Algerian Agreement of 27 December 1968 enabled children in kafala care to benefit from a family reunification measure in France provided that the other conditions for such a measure were met (income, housing). In 2010 the French Ombudsman called on the legislature to reconsider the question of kafala, advocated that children placed by judicial decision in kafala care should, at a minimum, be eligible for simple adoption and requested the abolition “of the five-year period of residence required by Article 21-12 of the Civil Code for French nationality to be sought by children placed by judicial decision in kafala care and raised by a French national, the possession of nationality being the only means for such children to become adoptable”. Lastly, two private member’s Bills, one on the adoption of children lawfully placed in kafala care, tabled by Senator A. Milon on 10 March 2011, the other on abandoned children and adoption tabled by Member of Parliament M. Tabarot on 8 February 2012, have been registered with the Presidency of the National Assembly and with that of the Senate. The aim of the Bills is for placement in kafala care by judicial decision or non-judicial decision (the Milon Bill) to be equated with simple adoption.",[],[],[],['8'],['8-1'],[],0
67,001-21922,ENG,NLD,ADMISSIBILITY,2001,ÖZMEN v. THE NETHERLANDS,4,Inadmissible,Elisabeth Palm;Gaukur Jörundsson,"The applicant states that he is İbrahim Özmen, a Turkish national of Kurdish origin, born in 1978. At the time of introduction of the application, the applicant was detained in the Netherlands for expulsion purposes. He is represented before the Court by Ms G.E.M. Later, a lawyer practising in The Hague. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. On 16 February 1999, following the apprehension of the Kurdish leader Abdullah Öcalan by the Turkish authorities, a protest demonstration took place in The Hague in the course of which protesters occupied the residence of the Greek Ambassador and members of the Ambassador’s household were prevented from leaving the premises. On 17 February 1999, the applicant was arrested and subsequently detained in police custody (inverzekeringstelling) on suspicion of involvement in the offence of unlawfully depriving a person of his of liberty. Whilst in police custody, the applicant’s provisional placement in aliens’ detention (voorlopige vreemdelingenbewaring) was ordered, after he had been heard on this matter. On 24 March 1999, the applicant filed an appeal with the Hague Regional Court (Arrondissementsrechtbank) against the decision to order his provisional placement in aliens’ detention and he requested the court to award him compensation. The applicant was released from custody on 26 March 1999 and handed over to the aliens’ police (vreemdelingenpolitie), who placed him in aliens’ detention for the purposes of expulsion (vreemdelingenbewaring) under Article 26 § 1 (a) of the Aliens Act (Vreemdelingenwet). Subsequently and on the same day, the applicant applied for asylum or, alternatively, a residence permit on humanitarian grounds. As a result of the lodging of this request, the legal basis for his placement in aliens’ detention was changed to Article 26 § 1 (c) of the Aliens Act. On 12 May 1999, following a hearing held on 8 April 1999, the Hague Regional Court sitting in Nieuwersluis rejected the applicant’s appeal of 24 March 1999. It noted at the outset that the applicant did not hold a valid residence permit, that he lacked sufficient means of subsistence and that he had no fixed abode. In these circumstances, it accepted that the suspicions that the applicant would seek ways to evade his expulsion were not unfounded. It further noted that an order for the applicant’s expulsion had been issued. Although the Regional Court found that the hearing of the applicant on the measure of his provisional placement in aliens’ detention had fallen short of the requirements of Article 82 of the Aliens’ Decree (Vreemdelingenbesluit) in that it had been conducted in too routinely a manner and it was not apparent that the applicant had realised what was at issue, it concluded that this had not harmed the applicant’s material interests. On this point, the Regional Court observed that hearings pursuant to Article 82 of the Aliens’ Decree were held so that the person concerned might have an opportunity to put forward facts or circumstances which could lead to the conclusion that the imposition of this measure was not called for. However, at the hearing before the Regional Court of 8 April 1999 it could not be established whether any such facts or circumstances had in fact existed. The Hague Regional Court further held that it had not appeared that it was highly likely that the applicant’s asylum request would be granted. It concluded that the applicant’s placement in aliens’ detention was in accordance with the Aliens Act and, after having balanced all interests involved, could reasonably be regarded as justified. It consequently rejected the applicant’s claim for compensation for the time spent in aliens’ detention. On 31 August 1999, the State Secretary informed the Dutch Parliament that, in view of reports on what had happened to two asylum seekers who had been expelled to Turkey, a policy decision had been taken to suspend temporarily the expulsions of Turkish nationals of Kurdish origin. On the same day, the applicant was released from aliens’ detention. Article 26 of the Aliens Act, insofar as relevant, provides: “1. If the interests of public order, public policy or national security so require, the following categories of aliens may be detained: a. aliens whose expulsion has been ordered; b. aliens in respect of whom there are serious ground to believe that their expulsion will be ordered; c. aliens who are not allowed to reside in the Netherlands by virtue of any of the provisions contained in Articles 8-10 <of the Aliens Act>, pending the decision on an application for a residence permit, a permanent residence permit or leave to enter as refugees. 2. An alien shall not be detained when, and detention shall be terminated as soon as, he intimates that he wishes to leave the Netherlands and is in fact in a position to do so. 3. Detention for the reasons set out in the first sentence of paragraph 1 and for the categories referred to under b. or c. of that paragraph shall not be of longer duration than one month. ...” An alien whose expulsion has been ordered can, in principle, remain in aliens’ detention for an unlimited period of time. The lawfulness of a placement in aliens’ detention can, however, be challenged before a court. Where the court is of the opinion that there are no prospects of expulsion within a reasonable time, it can order that the measure of placement in aliens’ detention be terminated. It has been established in the case-law of the Legal Uniformity Division (Rechtseenheidskamer) of the Hague Regional Court that the interest of an alien to be released from aliens’ detention increases with the passage of time. Where a placement in aliens’ detention exceeds a period of six months, it is generally held that the alien’s interest in being released is greater than the interest to keep him in detention for the purposes of expulsion. Depending on the specific circumstances of each case, this point in time may also be reached before or after six months have passed. It may be later where the alien frustrates the determination of his identity or nationality and it may be earlier where the alien concerned is unable to obtain travel documents for reasons beyond his control. Although no appeal lies against a decision by the Regional Court in proceedings concerning requests for release from detention for expulsion purposes, an appeal to the Court of Appeal (Gerechtshof) is available in relation to a decision taken in the context of such proceedings on a request for compensation for the time spent in detention for expulsion purposes. Furthermore, an appeal may be admitted in which the complaint is made that in the decision challenged a fundamental principle of law has been disrespected (cf. The Hague Court of Appeal, 12 November 1998, Nederlandse Jurisprudentie 1999, nr. 127) There is no time-limit for the filing of an appeal against a decision of placement in aliens’ detention and in principle a person placed in aliens’ detention may file as many appeals against this decision as he sees fit. When the lawfulness of a decision of placement in aliens’ detention has been determined for a first time, the examination of any subsequent appeal in this respect will be limited to the lawfulness of the continuation of the placement in aliens’ detention as from the date of the last judicial decision taken on this point. On 27 July 1999, the State Secretary of Justice requested the Hague Regional Court to suspend until 15 August 1999 its examination of appeals, including requests for injunctions on expulsions, filed by asylum seekers of Kurdish origin, in view of a recent report of one such asylum seeker having encountered serious problems after his expulsion to Turkey. As the veracity of this report was not certain, the Minister of Foreign Affairs had been requested to investigate the matter and to submit his findings as to the origin, background and veracity of the report before 15 August 1999. On 31 August 1999, the State Secretary informed the Dutch Parliament that, in view of reports on what had happened to two asylum seekers who had been expelled to Turkey, a policy decision had been taken to suspend temporarily the expulsion of Turkish nationals of Kurdish origin. On 16 December 1999, the State Secretary informed the Dutch Parliament that the results of an investigation into the facts on the basis of which the expulsion of Turkish nationals of Kurdish origin had been temporarily suspended had led to the lifting of that suspension.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
68,001-57475,ENG,DEU,CHAMBER,1983,CASE OF ECKLE v. GERMANY (ARTICLE 50),2,Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses award - domestic proceedings;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings,,"1. The Eckle case was referred to the Court on 18 May 1981 by the European Commission of Human Rights (""the Commission""). The case originated in an application (no. 8130/78) against the Federal Republic of Germany lodged with the Commission on 27 September 1977 by two German nationals, Mr. Hans Eckle and his wife Marianne. 2. By a judgment of 15 July 1982, the Court found a breach of Article 6 § 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention in that the applicants had not received a hearing within a reasonable time (Series A no. 51, point 2 of the operative provisions and paragraphs 71-95 of the reasons, pp. 32-40). The only outstanding matter to be settled is the question of the application of Article 50 (art. 50) in the present case. Accordingly, as regards the facts the Court will confine itself here to giving the pertinent details; for further particulars, reference should be made to paragraphs 9 to 60 of the above-mentioned judgment (ibid., pp. 8-28). 3. At the hearings on 22 March 1982, counsel for the applicants stated that, should the Court find a violation of the Convention, his clients would be claiming just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50) for the prejudice suffered as a result of the unreasonable length of the proceedings and possibly for legal costs; he did not, however, quantify their claims. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany (""the Government"") did not take a stand on the matter. In its judgment of 15 July 1982, the Court reserved the whole of this question. The Commission was invited to submit to the Court, within the coming two months, its written observations and, in particular, to notify the Court of any friendly settlement at which the Government and the applicants might have arrived (see point 3 of the operative provisions and paragraph 96 of the reasons, ibid., p. 40). 4. After one extension of the above-mentioned time-limit by the President of the Chamber and in accordance with his Orders and directions, the registry received: - on 15 October 1982, 19 November 1982 and 17 January 1983, through the Secretary to the Commission, the Delegate’s and the applicants’ respective observations; - on 28 October 1982, 14 December 1982 and 14 February 1983, the Government’s comments. These documents revealed that no friendly settlement had been reached. 5. By letter dated 6 October 1982, which was received at the registry six days later, the lawyer for Mr. and Mrs. Eckle informed the Registrar that he was no longer representing them; on 12 October, they instructed Mr. von Stackelberg as their lawyer. 6. Mr. L. Liesch, substitute judge, took the place of Mr. D. Evrigenis, who was prevented from taking further part in the consideration of the case (Rules 22 § 1 and 24 § 1 of the Rules of Court). 7. After consulting, through the Deputy Registrar, the Agent of the Government and the Delegate of the Commission, the Court decided on 25 May 1983 that there was no call to hold hearings.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
69,001-22690,ENG,GBR,ADMISSIBILITY,2002,ALLEN v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,1,Inadmissible,Matti Pellonpää;Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant, Mr Brian Roger Allen, is a United Kingdom national, who was born in 1948 and is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment in HM Prison Coldingley, Surrey. He is represented before the Court by Mr Newman and Mr Kessler, lawyers practising in London. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. On 9 May 1991, the applicant was served by the Inland Revenue with a Notice pursuant to section 20(1) of the Taxes Management Act 1970, which, inter alia, required the applicant to provide a certified statement of his assets and liabilities as at 31 January 1991. On 13 August 1991, when the applicant had failed to comply, he was summonsed to appear before the General Commissioners. The summons warned him that failure to comply with the notice rendered him liable to a penalty not exceeding 50 pounds sterling (GBP) pursuant to section 98(1) of the 1970 Act. (The penalty had in fact been increased to GBP 300). On 30 October 1991, the applicant still having failed to comply was presented with a “Hansard Warning.” This involved the reading out to him of the reply of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to a Parliamentary question on 18 October 1991. This outlined the practice of the Inland Revenue in cases of fraud indicating that it might accept a money settlement instead of instituting criminal proceedings and that its decision as to whether to accept a settlement or institute criminal proceedings would take into account whether the taxpayer had inter alia given full facilities for investigation into his affairs. On or about 3 April 1992, the applicant delivered to the Inland Revenue a schedule of his assets as at 31 January 1991 as required by the notice. The applicant was later charged with 13 counts of cheating the public revenue of income tax and corporation tax. Count 11 specified: “STATEMENT OF OFFENCE Cheating Her Majesty the Queen and the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, contrary to common law. PARTICULARS OF OFFENCE [The applicant] on or about 3 April 1992 with intent to defraud... cheated Her Majesty the Queen and the Commissioners of Inland Revenue of public revenue, namely, income tax, by delivering... to an Inspector of Taxes a schedule of assets as at 31 January 1991 in respect of his assets and the assets of his minor children which was false, misleading and deceptive in that it omitted to disclose divers assets which were owned by him. Particulars of the omitted assets are – his beneficial interest in shares issued by off-shore companies, his beneficial interest in properties held in the names of off-shore companies and his beneficial interest in bank accounts held in the United Kingdom and in Jersey in the names of off-shore companies.” The applicant was convicted of all counts on 19 February 1998. On 20 February 1998, he was sentenced to 13 concurrent terms of seven years’ imprisonment and a confiscation order made in the sum of 3,137,165 pounds sterling (GBP). This sum was calculated as being the lesser of the two sums, namely the amount of benefit from the offences (GBP 4 million) and the applicant’s total realisable assets (GBP 3,137,165). On 7 July 1999, the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal against conviction and on 11 October 1999, dismissed his appeal against sentence. In relation to the applicant’s argument that he remained liable to pay the outstanding unpaid tax, it noted the undertaking given by the Inland Revenue on 20 February 1998 that it would not pursue the applicant for pre-existing tax liabilities out of any income which he might acquire in future. On 10 October 2000, the House of Lords, reversing an earlier refusal, allowed his petition for leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal on a number of points and also permitted him to raise a new point relating to Article 6 of the Convention as concerned his conviction on count 11. On 11 October 2001, the House of Lords dismissed his appeal. Lord Hutton giving judgment noted the applicant’s arguments under the Convention in which he relied in particular upon the cases of Funke v. France and Saunders v. the United Kingdom, that the prosecution case against him breached his right to a fair trial as he had been compelled under threat of penalty to incriminate himself by providing the schedule of assets and found as follows: “... the present case is one which relates to the obligation of a citizen to pay taxes and to his duty not to cheat the Revenue. It is self evident that payment of taxes fixed by the legislature is essential for the functioning of any democratic state. It is also self-evident that to ensure the due payment of taxes the State must have power to require its citizens to inform it of the amount of their annual income and to have sanctions available to enforce the provision of that information ...” He proceeded to review the tax legislation which required taxpayers to make tax returns. “It is clearly permissible for a State to enact such provisions and there could be no substance in an argument that there is a violation of Article 6 § 1 if the revenue prosecuted a citizen for cheating the revenue by furnishing a standard tax return containing false information. Similarly, in the present case, viewed against that background that the State, for the purpose of collecting tax, is entitled to require a citizen to inform it of his income and to enforce penalties for failure to do so, the section 20(1) notice requiring information cannot constitute a violation of the right against self-incrimination. The present case is therefore clearly distinguishable from Saunders on that ground ...”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
70,001-22069,ENG,ITA,ADMISSIBILITY,2001,MEAZZI v. ITALY,4,Inadmissible,Christos Rozakis,"The applicant is an Italian national, born in 1921 and living in Milan. She is represented before the Court by Mr C. Fumagalli, a lawyer practising in Milan. G.B. was the owner of an apartment in Milan, which he had let to S.H. In a writ served on the tenant on 29 March 1991, G.G. communicated his intention to terminate the lease and summoned the tenant to appear before the Milan Magistrate. By a decision of 15 April 1991, which was made enforceable on 22 April 1991, the Milan Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 1 November 1992. On 26 May 1992, the applicant became the owner of the apartment. On 27 January 1993, she made a statutory declaration that she urgently required the premises as accommodation for herself. On 29 January 1993, she served notice on the tenant requiring him to vacate the premises. On 18 February 1993, she served notice on the tenant informing him that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 26 March 1993. Between 26 March 1993 and 17 September 1996, the bailiff made fifteen attempts to recover possession. Each attempt proved unsuccessful, as the applicant was never granted the assistance of the police in enforcing the order for possession. On 29 October 1996, the applicant recovered possession of the apartment.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
71,001-22540,ENG,NOR,ADMISSIBILITY,2002,FEDERATION OF OFFSHORE WORKERS' TRADE UNIONS AND OTHERS v. NORWAY,1,Inadmissible,Georg Ress;Mark Villiger,"The first applicant, the Federation of Offshore Workers’ Trade Unions (Oljearbeidernes Fellessammenslutning - “the OFS”), was established in 1970 and is a federation of trade unions for workers of all categories in the North Sea oil and gas industry. It is represented before the Court by Mr B. Endresen, a lawyer practising in Stavanger, Norway. The second applicant, Mr Claus Idland was born in 1950 and lives in Figgjo; the third applicant, Mr Kenneth Kråkstad, was born in 1963 and lives in Tjelta. They are both Norwegian citizens. At the time of the events complained of they worked as roustabouts on oil rigs on the Norwegian Continental Shelf and were members of the OFS. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. Between 1980, when the OFS became a nation wide federation, and 1994, when the events giving rise to their application under the Convention occurred, claims being negotiated by the organisation, including every collective wage agreement except for one in 1992, were referred to compulsory arbitration on eight occasions. In the spring of 1994 the Confederation of Norwegian Business and Industry (Næringslivets Hovedorganisasjon - NHO) and the Norwegian Oil Industry Association (Oljeindustriens Landsforening - “the OLF”) negotiated with the OFS and the Norwegian Association of Supervisors, Technicians and other Managers (Norges Arbeidslederforbund -“the NA”) on a new wage agreement to take effect on 1 July 1994. The negotiations were conducted with three major employee federations, namely the OFS, the Norwegian Oil and Petrochemical Workers’ Union (Norsk Olje og Petrokjemikeres Fagforbund - “the NOPEF”) and the Norwegian Supervisors’ Association (Norges Arbeidslederforbund - “the NALF”), on 1, 6 and 7 June 1994. The main demand made by the OFS was a reduction in the retirement age from 67 to 60 years, with a possibility of flexible retirement between 57 and 62 years; this demand entailed a 12.5 % increase in costs. In addition a pay rise was requested. The OLF and the NOPEF agreed to a 2.5 % pay rise. The same offer was also made to the OFS, but the negotiations were broken off without any agreement being reached. On 9 June 1994 the OFS issued a collective strike warning with respect to 106 of its members at the Gyda platform (oil rig). On 14 June 1994 the NA issued a collective strike warning for all members, initially confined to 50 members at the Gullfaks B and Oseberg C platforms. On 15 June 1994 the OLF issued a warning of a lockout of 3,600 OFS members at all fixed installations on the Norwegian continental shelf. On 24 June 1994 the OLF warned that there would be a lockout of 821 NA members included in the collective notice but not part of the initial strike group. In accordance with the procedures laid down in the Act on Labour Disputes 1927 (lov om arbeidstvister - Law no. 1 of 5 May 1927) for disputes involving a strike or lockout, the State Mediator (Riksmeklingsmannen) made an order prohibiting any work stoppage prior to compulsory mediation and summoned the parties to mediation. Midnight on Thursday, 30 June 1994 was then fixed as the time-limit for resolving the dispute by mediation. As the mediator was unable to broker an agreement between the parties, the mediation was terminated on 30 June 1994 at 11.45 p.m. and work stopped after midnight. The Minister of Local Government and Labour thereafter summoned the parties to a joint meeting that same night at 00.15 a.m. The parties briefed the Minister on the situation. The Minister referred to the serious consequences of a complete work stoppage on all fixed installations on the Norwegian section of the Continental Shelf, and stated that at a cabinet meeting the following day he would recommend that the Government should issue a provisional ordinance imposing compulsory arbitration of the disputes. In support of his recommendation for the Government to adopt a provisional ordinance, the Minister stated that the industrial action announced would lead to the complete suspension of all Norwegian oil and gas production, leading to a fall in production of an estimated value of NOK 2.5 billion per week (close to EUR 0.34 billion). This would worsen Norway’s foreign trade balance by a corresponding amount. The State’s tax revenues would be reduced by an estimated NOK 1 billion per week and its direct oil revenues by NOK 800 million per week. The industrial action would have direct consequences for the State’s financial commitment for the current year and would affect the State’s financial needs both that year and the following year. The estimated impact on the balance of trade and the reduction of State revenues would be extremely harmful to the Norwegian economy. An industrial dispute of any length was likely to have very damaging consequences. Oil and gas not produced at that time would nevertheless be exploited at a later stage and that would result in an increase of production after the different oil fields had passed the maximum production level. This production increase would be spread over a number of years, until such time as production ceased. Thus the overall societal consequences of the industrial action would also depend inter alia on the evolution in price levels until the possibilities of exploitation of these resources had been exhausted. Since Norwegian natural gas was being delivered under long-term contracts, a work stoppage over a lengthy period would seriously reduce Norway’s credibility as a reliable supplier of gas. If the technical installations were to be closed down for longer periods, it could entail damage to the installations and negative consequences for safety would follow. The equipment was designed with a view to regular use over long periods. A work stoppage of any length would moreover require the lay off of other categories of employees. At the close of the negotiations the situation was deadlocked with both parties unwilling to compromise. It therefore seemed likely that the conflict would continue for some time. The recommendation concluded: “Considering the matter as a whole, the Ministry ... has reached the conclusion that the conflict ... should be resolved without industrial action. In this assessment, great emphasis has been placed on the fact that the complete cessation of production of oil and gas would lead to a considerable loss of income for the country. The industrial conflict will therefore have great consequences for the financing of the State and Social-Security budgets. The Ministry has further emphasised the importance of not undermining Norway’s position as a dependable and reliable gas supplier. Norway has ratified several Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) which protect freedom of association (Convention nos. 87, 98 and 154). As interpreted by competent organs, the Conventions only allow intervention in the right to strike where the strike jeopardises the life, health or personal security of the entire population or parts of it. The European Social Charter, under the Council of Europe, contains in Article 6, 4 cf., Article 31, corresponding provisions which protect the right to take industrial action. In the light of the fact that the Norwegian authorities have on several occasions imposed compulsory arbitration and prohibited strike action in labour disputes in the North Sea, the OFS has on three occasions lodged complaints against Norway with the ILO, alleging breaches of the Conventions on freedom of association. The ILO agencies have in this connection levelled criticism against the Norwegian authorities’ practice, stating that the legislative interventions in labour disputes in the oil sector are not compatible with the principles of freedom of association. The Ministry of Local Government and Labour has appraised the problems in relation to the Conventions and the criticism expressed by the ILO bodies and balanced this against the harmful effects of the strike, and after careful consideration has concluded that it is correct and necessary to intervene in the dispute. In this context great weight has been given to the fact that the situation between the parties upon the expiry of the deadline for mediation was absolute deadlock and that there is therefore reason to believe that the dispute may be long-lasting."" Under Article 17 of the Constitution, the Government adopted with immediate effect on 1 July 1994 a provisional ordinance, according to which disputes relating to the revision of the wage-agreement in question were to be settled by the National Wages Board (Rikslønnsnemnda), the provisions of the Compulsory Arbitration Act 1952 (lov om lønnsnemnd i arbeidstvister - Act no. 7 of 19 December 1952) should apply, and work stoppage and picketing were prohibited. Work was duly resumed the same day at 2 p.m. The Board is a permanent arbitration body composed of seven members, five of whom are appointed by the Government for a period of three years and the other two are appointed by the respective parties to the dispute. The group of five includes three members who are independent of the Government, the employers’ or employees’ organisations and two experts representing respectively employers’ and employees’ interests, who, unlike the other members, have no voting rights. On 6 July 1994 the OFS brought an action in the Oslo City Court (byrett) demanding that the compulsory arbitration be held invalid. By judgment of 27 July 1995 the City Court found for the State, represented by the Ministry of Local Government and Labour, and ordered the OFS to pay the State’s legal costs. The OFS appealed to the Borgarting High Court (lagmannsrett), invoking an error of law. Concurrently the applicant organisation sought to appeal directly to the Supreme Court (Høyesterett). The Appeals Selection Committee (kjæremålsutvalg) of the Supreme Court subsequently granted leave. The OFS claimed firstly that the provisional ordinance was unlawful (ugyldig) as the ban on strikes ran counter to general principles of constitutional law. Alternatively, the OFS argued that the ban violated Norway’s international legal obligations which, in the event of a dispute, override Norwegian domestic law. The State, represented by the Ministry of Local Government and Labour, disputed these contentions. In its judgment of 10 April 1997, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected the OFS’s appeal and ordered it to pay the State’s legal costs in the proceedings. Mr Justice Stang Lund’s opinion, to which the other Supreme Court justices subscribed, included the following reasons: As regards the position under domestic law, it was noted that between 1953 and 1994, 50 Acts of Parliament and 33 provisional ordinances had been adopted on compulsory arbitration in labour disputes, including 8 disputes in the oil sector, and 20 royal decrees had been adopted under the legislation on compulsory arbitration. The longstanding practice of using compulsory arbitration to settle labour disputes in pursuance of major societal interests did not contravene general legal principles of constitutional law. Setting aside a statute or a provisional ordinance on the grounds that it conflicted with general principles of constitutional law could only be envisaged in the most extreme cases. Although freedom of association and the right to take strike action were generally accepted in Norway, it was also generally recognised that the right to strike was not unlimited. Since 1915 the legislation had contained provisions stating when and on what conditions strike action could be taken in labour disputes. In order to safeguard substantial societal interests, bans on strikes and compulsory arbitration had been imposed by special legislation or provisional ordinances. On the question whether the restriction on strikes conflicted with Norway’s international law obligations, it was recalled that work stoppages were not mentioned in the ILO Convention nos. 87 and 98, nor had they been a theme for negotiation during the ILO labour conferences in 1948 and 1949. Since those conferences, the stance taken by the ILO bodies had evolved. The Committee on Freedom of Association had already expressed the view in 1952 that from the ILO Statute, the ILO conference in Philadelphia in 1944 and Convention no. 87, it was implicit that the right to strike and to impose a lockout were fundamental aspects of the right to freedom of association, which view was later accepted by the expert Committee. This evolution in the interpretation advocated by the ILO bodies led to their criticism of the use of compulsory arbitration in Norway. The Freedom of Association Committee of the ILO Governing Body and, subsequently, the Committee of Experts had in many instances, including in Norwegian cases, affirmed that the right to strike must be regarded as a part of trade union freedom of association and the right to bargain, and that it was therefore protected against interference by the authorities. However, according to the practice of the ILO bodies, strike action could be forbidden in respect of public servants engaged in the administration of the State, if it would affect essential services thereby jeopardising the life, health or personal security of the entire population or parts of it, and the harm was clear and imminent. Harmful economic effects to society, even if deemed substantial, had not been considered a sufficient reason for intervention. Dock work, oil production, education and transport were examples of services that had been regarded as nonessential. Since 1962 the use of compulsory arbitration in Norway had been the subject of eight complaints to ILO agencies. The Freedom of Association Committee, with the support of the ILO’s Governing Body, had endorsed the petitioner’s contention that the use of compulsory arbitration did not comply with the principle of freedom of association. Three of the successful petitions had concerned compulsory arbitration in respect of the OFS. However, the court emphasised that, under the 1919 ILO Statute, the Governing Body, the Committee of Experts and the Freedom of Association Committee had no competence to determine with binding effect disputes on the interpretation of the ILO Conventions, for which competence was vested in the International Court of Justice. The court observed that Norway had never accepted that the use of compulsory arbitration required by a substantial societal interest was contrary to the ILO Convention nos. 87 and 98. In its view, the opinions held by the institutions of the ILO on the limits to State intervention in labour disputes did not have a basis in the Convention texts as negotiated and adopted. As regards the more recent provision in Article 8 § 1 (d) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the court observed that Norway had found it necessary to make a reservation in the light of the use of compulsory arbitration, with possible further exceptions being made to the right to strike. Moreover, the court noted that the Norwegian practice of compulsory arbitration had been criticised by the European Committee of Social Rights of the 1961 European Social Charter for going further than authorised by Articles 6 § 4 and 31 § 1 of the Charter. In 1995 the Committee had proposed in a draft recommendation that a provisional ordinance on compulsory arbitration of disputes in the oil sector dated 2 July 1990 be deemed incompatible with the Charter. The Governmental Committee later rejected the proposal. In these circumstances there was, in the court’s view, no clear practice establishing that the provisional ordinance in issue in the present case was contrary to the Social Charter. The court also had regard to the European Court’s Schmidt and Dahlström v. Sweden judgment of 6 February 1976 (Series A no. 21), and noted that neither the Commission nor the Court had found an infringement of Article 11 § 1 of the Convention by virtue of the award of increments to members of non-striking unions, but not to members of striking unions, which included the applicants although they had not actually been on strike themselves. In addition, it was noted that in interpreting Article 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in J.B. v. Canada (case 118/1982), the Human Rights Committee had had regard to the fact that, while the right to strike was expressly included in Article 8 § 1 (d) of the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, it was not mentioned in Article 22, indicating that this right fell outside its scope. In the light of the above, the court did not find that Norway was required by international law to limit the use of compulsory arbitration in a labour dispute where such intervention was necessary in order to safeguard substantial societal interests. In any event, neither the Convention nor the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights contained any detailed standards limiting State restrictions on the right to strike, such as those derived by the ILO bodies from the ILO Convention nos. 87 and 98 and the Philadelphia Declaration. Accordingly, it concluded that the provisional ordinance of 1 July 1994 was not at variance with Norway’s obligations under international law. Thus, it was not necessary to examine the question of any conflict between Norway’s obligations under international law and its domestic law. The European Committee of Social Rights, formerly the Committee of Independent Experts of the Social Charter, in its 17th report (with reference to the period 1994 to 1996), observed with respect to the provisional ordinance in issue in the present case that it accepted that the implications of the industrial action would have been serious in terms of the loss of revenue. However, the Committee was not satisfied that the situation was so serious that it fell within Article 31 of the Charter, that is to say that it was necessary for the protection of the public interest. It noted that the loss of revenue would not necessarily have been of a permanent nature. Accordingly, it concluded that in this case the imposition of compulsory arbitration and the termination of the industrial action did not fall within the terms of Article 31 of the Charter (Conclusions XIV-1, Vol. 2, Norway, Article 6 paragraph 4, p. 621). When the matter was subsequently considered by the Governmental Committee of the Social Charter, which observed: “Several delegates thought that they were not in a position to assess the Norwegian situation since the case law of the Committee of Independent Experts on the interpretation of Article 31 of the Charter is sparse, and it is difficult for them to assess whether, in the case at hand, the action of the Government went beyond what is authorised by Article 31 of the Charter.” The Governmental Committee decided to draw the attention of the Norwegian authorities to the fact that action by Parliament or the Government in the event of compulsory arbitration should not go beyond the limits laid down by Article 31 of the Charter (Governmental Committee Report XIV-1, paragraph 184). No warning was issued by the Governmental Committee with respect to the events in 1994. During the proceedings before the Court, the Government supplied information according to which if the strike had lasted one month it would have reduced the value of petroleum extraction by approximately NOK 11 billion (1 % of Norway’s Gross Domestic Product) and central government revenues by NOK 8 billion (2%). The calculations did not take into account shutdown and start-up costs, the fact that it would be some time before the production level reached the pre-shutdown level and that a shutdown of any length could result in damage to installations and equipment that was designed to be in continuous operation over a longer period. Since production would normally be maintained at maximum level, recovery of lost production would only take place after peak production levels at the relevant fields had been reached. Notwithstanding the possibility of recovering lost revenues at a later stage, a halt in extraction would inevitably be accompanied by a loss in extraction value, export earnings and central government revenues for the year in which the halt occurred. The real loss in revenues would thus depend on the prices prevailing at the time of recovery. The net present value of the loss would have amounted to approximately 40%. The central government budget deficit was sizeable and had grown from 1991 to 1993; as at May 1994, it was expected to amount to NOK 42.5 billion (before loan transactions) for that year. A strike would have caused an increase in that deficit. The Government further submitted that Norway, together with Russia and Algeria, was the main gas exporting country to the European Union (“the EU”). In 1994 natural gas covered approximately 20% of the primary energy consumption in the EU countries. Norwegian gas supply counted for approximately 20% of gas imports and 10% of gas consumption in the EU area. The rigidity and inflexibility associated with pipeline delivery of natural gas implied that sources of gas supply were impossible or difficult to replace. Substantial volumes of hydrocarbons passing through the Emden (Germany) and later Zeebrugge (Belgium) landing points were largely irreplaceable in the short and medium term. Industries and households in this region in particular would depend on the Norwegian gas supply. A storage facility had been built in Germany but would only cover 12% of Norway’s obligations for a fortnight. In the event that the Norwegian gas supply were to be cut off, the consequences would be substantial for the North German and North Belgian industries, which did not have any alternative possibilities and would be faced with complex shutting down and restarting procedures. Norway had therefore undertaken to be a reliable gas supplier, notably under the Troll Gas Sales Agreements, which took effect in October 1993, and involved an investment of over NOK 100 billion for platforms, terminals and pipelines and NOK 2 billion for a storage facility. Under these agreements suppliers and buyers were bound under unique physical and commercial arrangements forming a complex web of mutually dependent relations, with stability in gas supply being a key element. Any suspension in delivery would be likely to lead to a dramatic fall in both current and future gas prices. In response to the above-mentioned information adduced by the Government, the applicants submitted information to the effect that the real price per barrel of crude oil was NOK 124.90 in 1994, NOK 119.30 in 1995, NOK 147.10 in 1996, NOK 145.70 in 1997, NOK 101.40 in 1998, NOK 146.60 in 1999 and NOK 253.00 in 2000. In 2000 it was assumed that the average lifetime of oil fields was, in fact, longer than the 1994 estimate of seven years, on which the Government apparently relied. A deferment of production from 1994 because of a strike could thus have led to far higher real prices than would have been achieved without a delay, and a present value loss that was less than the 40% suggested by the Government. The applicant further stated that in 1994 Norway had an export surplus of NOK 54 billion and the public administration had been in the unique position of having significant net receivables (NOK 263.9 billion in 1992, 244.1 billion in 1993, 233.8 billion in 1994 and 261.1 billion in 1995).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

Until October 1994 the applicant lived in Eğrikavak, a village of Ovacık district in Tunceli, where her husband, Saycan İçyer owned property. Saycan İçyer died in 1999. On 3 October 1994 security forces forcibly evacuated Eğrikavak on account of disturbances in the region. They also destroyed the applicant’s property. The applicant and her family then moved to Istanbul, where they currently live. The applicant contends that on 3 March 1999 her husband Saycan İçyer filed a petition with the Prime Minister’s office, the Governor’s office in Tunceli and with the District Governor’s office in Ovacık requesting permission to return to his village. However, the application does not contain the petition in question. The Public Relations Unit of the Prime Minister’s Office sent a letter, dated 17 March 1999, stating that the petition Mr Saycan İçyer lodged with the Prime Minister’s office had been transmitted to the Ministry of the Interior for consideration.

He received no reply to his petition within the 60-day period prescribed by Law no. 2577. Until October 1994 the applicant lived in Karataş, a village of the Ovacık district in Tunceli, where he owns property. It is to be noted that Bira Bozoğlu appears to be the owner of the property in question on the documents submitted to the Court. On 5 October 1994 security forces forcibly evacuated Karataş on account of disturbances in the region. They also destroyed the applicant’s property. The applicant and his family then moved to Istanbul, where they currently live. On 23 August 2001 the applicant filed a petition with the Governor’s office in Tunceli requesting permission to return to his village and to use his property. On 27 August 2001 the Governor’s office in Tunceli received his petition. The applicant received no response to his petition within the 60-day period prescribed by Law no. 2577. The official records indicated that the inhabitants of Eğrikavak and Karataş had evacuated their village on account of intense terrorist activities in the region and threats issued by the PKK (Workers’ Party of Kurdistan) terrorist organisation against the villagers. The security forces had not forced the applicants to leave their village. Currently there was no obstacle preventing villagers from returning to their homes and possessions in their villages. Persons who had left their villages as a result of terrorism had already started returning and regaining their activities in their villages. In this connection, in a letter of 15 October 2002 the District Governor of Ovacık informed the applicants that they could return to their villages and resume their economic activities if they wished. He further noted that all villages were open for re-settlement and that the authorities had been carrying out maintenance work to repair the infrastructure of the villages in the region. On 14 July 2004 the Law on Compensation for Losses resulting from Terrorism and the Fight against Terrorism was passed by the Grand National Assembly and entered into force on 27 July 2004 (“Compensation Law”). That Law provided for a sufficient remedy capable of redressing the Convention grievances of persons who were denied access to their possessions in their villages. In that connection Damage Assessment and Compensation Commissions were set up in seventy-six provinces. Persons who had suffered damage as a result of terrorism or of measures taken by the authorities to combat terrorism could lodge an application with the relevant compensation commission claiming compensation. The number of persons applying to these commissions had already attained approximately 170,000. A further 800 persons, whose applications were pending before the Court, had also applied to the compensation commissions. Many villagers had already been awarded compensation for the damage they had sustained. A description of the relevant domestic law can be found in the Court’s decision of İçyer v. Turkey (no. 18888/02, §§ 44-54, 12 January 2006) and in its judgment of Doğan and Others v. Turkey (nos. 88038811/02, 8813/02 and 8815-8819/02, §§ 31-35, ECHR 2004-VI).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
73,001-66611,ENG,TUR,ADMISSIBILITY,2004,SARAC v. TURKEY,4,Inadmissible,Georg Ress;Mark Villiger,"The applicant, Ms Selal Saraç, is a Turkish national who was born in 1970 and lives in Germany. She is represented before the Court by Mr M. Demir, a lawyer practising in Germany. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, are as follows. On 18 September 1995 at about 2 a.m. the applicant’s house in Nusaybin was raided by police officers from the Nusaybin police headquarters in order to arrest the applicant on suspicion of PKK membership and harbouring PKK members. The applicant had been taken into custody several times in the past, namely in the autumn of 1991, on 21 March 1993 and on 15 August 1994. During the arrest she was subjected to a body search in the presence of her children, husband and other family members. The applicant, her husband and three of her relatives were put in a police vehicle and taken to a doctor for a medical examination. The doctor stated that they were in good health and they were subsequently taken to the police headquarters in Nusaybin. At 3 p.m. the same day the applicant was taken to her house by police officers in order to conduct a search. She took the police officers to the cellar of the house and showed them a bomb which had been given to her by a member of the PKK. The bomb was subsequently destroyed by bomb disposal teams. She was then taken back to the Nusaybin police headquarters. During her period of detention at Nusaybin police headquarters, the applicant was stripped naked and blindfolded. She was hosed down with cold water, hung from her arms, beaten with a police truncheon and electric shocks were administrated to her sexual organs. Two days after her arrest, the applicant was transferred to Mardin police headquarters. During her detention at Mardin police headquarters, the applicant was allegedly blindfolded, stripped naked, held under cold water, given electric shocks, beaten, and raped by a village guard and a police commissioner. She was also forced to walk in a room filled with ice. While in Mardin, the applicant was taken to a doctor at the Mardin State Hospital who did not medically examine her but gave her painkillers to relieve her pain. She was then brought back to the Nusaybin police headquarters where she was detained for eleven days during which time she was stripped naked and was interrogated every night at 1 a.m. On 6 October 1995 a statement was taken from the applicant by police officers while she was still in custody. In her statement, the applicant admitted that she had let the PKK members use her cellar as a shelter, and maintained that the bomb which was found there had been put there by another woman. On 12 October 1995 the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor. In her statement, she denied her police statement alleging that it had been taken under duress. She maintained that PKK terrorists had never stayed in her cellar and that the cellar had been designed as a shelter during the Gulf War to protect her family from any possible chemical attack by Iraq. As to the bomb found in the cellar, the applicant stated that it had been given to her by a woman whom she did not know and that she had not been aware that it was a bomb. The same day, the applicant was placed in detention on remand. On 26 October 1995 the prosecutor at the Diyarbakır State Security Court filed an indictment against the applicant together with twelve other accused persons. She was accused of aiding and abetting members of an illegal organisation, an offence defined in Article 169 of the Criminal Code. On 3 April 1996 she was released pending trial. On 6 April 1996, some three days after her release, the applicant’s house was raided by police officers from the Nusaybin police headquarters and the applicant was taken into custody. She was hung from her arms and hit repeatedly on the head with truncheons as a result of which she lost consciousness. While she was unconscious, her feet were burnt by cigarettes. Following this, she was raped with a truncheon on two occasions. She was threatened by the police officers that if she refused to work as an informer for the police, she would be killed. The applicant refused to work as an informer. She was then taken by car to an isolated place and abandoned. On 19 April 1996 the applicant went to the Human Rights Foundation where she was medically examined. Following medical examinations carried out between 22 and 24 June 1996 in two different hospitals and a Nuclear Medical Centre in Istanbul, and gynaecological and neurological tests, x-rays, thorax graphics, scintigraphic imaging and examinations by an ear, nose and throat consultant as well as a psychiatrist, the doctors drafted a report dated 15 August 1996. It was concluded that the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment, such as post-traumatic stress, depression, marks on her feet caused by cigarette burns and a pelvic complaint, were compatible with the medical findings. On 5 September 1996 the applicant’s two legal representatives filed a complaint with the Istanbul public prosecutor. In their petition they submitted the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment. They also gave the names of the village guard who had allegedly raped her during her police custody. On 11 December 1996 the Diyarbakır State Security Court found the applicant guilty of aiding and abetting members of an illegal organisation and sentenced her to three years and nine months’ imprisonment. The applicant’s appeal against the judgment was rejected by the Court of Cassation on 17 November 1997. The Government submitted that the applicant was taken into custody on two occasions from 23 September to 18 October 1994 and from 18 September to 12 October 1995 respectively, on suspicion that she was aiding and abetting members of the PKK. However the Government denied that the applicant had been arrested on 6 December 1996. In this respect they submitted that the custody records did not mention her name. Concerning the applicant’s police custody from 18 September until 12 October 1995, the Government maintained that she was held in Nusaybin Police Headquarters from 18 September to 19 September and then she was transferred to Mardin Police Headquarters, where she was held until 1 October 1995. She was subsequently transferred back to Nusaybin Headquarters, where she was held until 12 October 1995. The Government further contended that the applicant was taken for a medical examination on 18 September 1995 and, according to the medical report, there was no sign of injury on her body. It was noted that she had a heart condition. Another medical report was issued on 12 October 1995 by the Nusaybin Health Clinic, which concluded that the applicant had not suffered physical abuse. The Government further maintained that the applicant had lodged a criminal complaint with the Istanbul public prosecutor on 23 August 1996. On 23 September 1996 the public prosecutor requested that the Nusaybin Police Headquarters submit information about the applicant’s alleged police custody, and that all relevant doctor reports and official documents be conveyed to the public prosecutor’s office. Furthermore, on 10 October 1996 the public prosecutor took a statement from F.A., a village guard, who was accused by the applicant of having raped her. F.A. denied the charges against him. On 17 December 1996, the applicant’s lawyer gave a statement to the public prosecutor, and asserted that she would convey the relevant medical reports and other evidence in the shortest possible time. Despite being notified, the applicant refused to come to the public prosecutor’s office to give a statement. Moreover, the documents promised by the applicant’s representative were never conveyed to the public prosecutor. Accordingly, on 3 March 1997 the public prosecutor delivered a decision of non-jurisdiction on account of insufficient evidence. The applicant did not appeal against this decision. The Government further submitted that on 18 September 1995 a search was conducted in the applicant’s house, as a result of which a shelter and a bomb were found. On 6 October 1995 the applicant gave a statement to the police, and described in detail her involvement with the PKK. On 12 October 1995 the applicant was taken before the public prosecutor, and subsequently before the Nusaybin Magistrate’s Court in Criminal Matters. She was remanded in custody. With an indictment dated 27 October 1995 the Diyarbakır public prosecutor instigated criminal proceedings against the applicant and accused her of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation under Article 169 of the Criminal Code. On 3 April 1996 the applicant was released pending trial. On 11 December 1996 the first instance-court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced her to three years’ and nine months’ imprisonment. On 17 November 1997, the Court of Cassation rejected the applicant’s request for appeal, finding the first-instance court’s establishment of the facts and evaluation of evidence in line with domestic law and general principles of law. A description of the domestic law may be found in the Nuray Şen v. Turkey decision (no. 41478/98, 30 April 2002).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
74,001-4670,ENG,AUT,ADMISSIBILITY,1999,VEREIN NETZWERK v. AUSTRIA,4,Inadmissible,Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant is a non-profit-making association with its seat in Hirtenberg. It is represented before the Court by Mr. Herbert Pochieser, a lawyer practising in Vienna. The applicant association has the aims of, inter alia, creating accommodation for socially disadvantaged persons, of speaking out for the concerns of socially disadvantaged persons, refugees and foreign workers, and of creating possibilities of encounter and exchange with these persons. In order to achieve these objectives it runs a house in Hirtenberg, which offers accommodation for socially disadvantaged persons in particular for young people and foreigners. The chairman of the applicant association is also living there. On 7 October 1992, in the late evening, police officers carried out a control in this house. On 16 November 1992 the applicant association lodged a complaint with the Lower Austria Independent Administrative Panel (Unabhängiger Verwaltungssenat) alleging violations of Articles 8, 9 and 11 of the Convention and of the Protection of the Home Act (Gesetz zum Schutz des Hausrechts). The Independent Administrative Panel held hearings on 25 June and 17 November 1993. It heard the chairman of the applicant association, the police officers who had carried out the control and the mayor of Hirtenberg as witnesses. On 10 May 1994 the Independent Administrative Panel partly rejected the applicant association’s complaint as being inadmissible and party dismissed it as being unfounded. Having regard to the evidence taken, it found the following facts established. Following a number of complaints from neighbours about illegally resident foreigners, the mayor of Hirtenberg requested the District Administrative Authority (Bezirkshaupt-mannschaft) to carry out a control under the Residence (Registration) Act (Meldegesetz). The control was carried out in the late evening of 7 October 1992. The police officers were let into the house by some of the inhabitants. The chairman of the applicant association criticised the late hour of the control but did not otherwise object. He contributed to the smooth carrying out of the control in that he went around with the police officers, gave general information about the inhabitants (e.g. about their country of origin), acted as a translator and helped to produce the required documents. The rooms within the house were opened upon request. The police examined whether the foreigners were legally resident by controlling their identity documents and residence permits, or by checking the status of their asylum proceedings. A search of the rooms was not carried out. The control was terminated within three quarters of an hour. The Independent Administrative Panel found that the applicant association, being a legal person, did not have a private and family life. Thus it could not rely on Article 8 of the Convention. Moreover, it had not claimed, and there was no indication, of any interference with its right to respect for its correspondence. Accordingly this complaint had to be rejected as being inadmissible. As regards the control, the Independent Administrative Panel noted that also a legal person could rely on the Protection of the Home Act. However, the said Act only applied where a search had been carried out. As the police officers were voluntarily granted access to the house as well as to each of the rooms within the house and, assisted by the applicant association’s chairman, only controlled the documents of the inhabitants, the contested action could not be qualified as a search. The Independent Administrative Panel added that the protection afforded by Article 8 of the Convention went further, in that it covered not only a search of premises but any interference with the right to respect for one’s home. In the present case the control was in conformity with Article 8 § 2 of the Convention, in particular it had its legal basis in the Residence (Registration Act) and the Aliens Police Act (Fremdenpolizeigesetz). Consequently, the complaint had to be dismissed as being unfounded. Further, the Independent Administrative Panel found that the applicant association, as a legal person, could not rely on Article 9 of the Convention and, therefore, rejected this complaint as being inadmissible. Finally, as to the complaint under Article 11 of the Convention, the Independent Administrative Panel found that the control at issue was not aimed at the applicant association but at the inhabitants of the housing project, who were not even necessarily members of the applicant association. Moreover, the control did not prevent the applicant association from pursuing its objectives. Even assuming that there had been an interference with the applicant association’s freedom of association, it had to be regarded as necessary in the interests of public safety. Having regard to the short duration of the control, it was also proportionate. Thus, this complaint was also unfounded. On 27 June 1994 the applicant association lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof). It relied on Article 8 of the Convention and on the Protection of the Home Act. It argued that the control carried out in its premises had to be qualified as a search and that it lacked a legal basis. Further, it relied on Article 11 of the Convention, claiming that the search prevented it from pursuing its objectives. On 28 November 1994 the Constitutional Court refused to deal with the applicant association’s complaint for lack of prospects of success. It noted that the case was not excluded from the jurisdiction of the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof). Subsequently the Constitutional Court, upon the applicant association’s request, referred the case to the Administrative Court. On 4 September 1995 the applicant association, upon the Administrative Court’s request, supplemented its complaint. It repeated its argument that the control had to be qualified as a search which lacked a legal basis, and added that there had not been any reasonable suspicion that foreigners were illegally resident on the premises. On 10 October 1995 the Administrative Court rejected the applicant association’s complaint as being inadmissible. It noted that the association relied on the right to respect for its home. This was a constitutionally guaranteed right which the Administrative Court was not called upon to review. The decision was served on 23 November 1995.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
75,001-23925,ENG,DEU,ADMISSIBILITY,2004,ATIK v. GERMANY,4,Inadmissible,Ireneu Cabral Barreto,"The applicant, Huseyin Atik, is a Turkish national, who was born in 1957 and lives in Hamburg. He was represented before the Court by Mr Gerhard Strate and Mr Klaus Ulrich Ventzke, lawyers practising in Hamburg. On 6 October 1995 the Hamburg Regional Court (Landgericht) convicted the applicant of drug trafficking and sentenced him to nine years' imprisonment. Following his conviction he was erving his sentence. As from 1996, he was continuously contacted by one Y., an undercover agent acting with the authorisation of the Hamburg police, who passed himself off as a potential purchaser of a larger amount of cocaine. At the applicant's request, the undercover agent contacted the applicant's counsel with a view to applying for the reopening of the criminal proceedings. The undercover agent met the counsel several times accompanied by other persons, however at one occasion – contrary to the instructions given by the Hamburg police – on his own initiative in the absence of other persons. The last visit took place on 3 November 1998. Thereafter the applicant informed the undercover agent that his former cell-mate T. could arrange for the delivery of a large quantity of cocaine for a price of 55,000 German Marks (DEM) per kilogram. After consulting the applicant, T. met the undercover agent in his flat on 4 November 1998 in order to hand over almost 12 kg of cocaine. While carrying out the transaction, he was arrested by the police. By a judgment of 17 June 1999, the Hamburg Regional Court convicted the applicant of drug trafficking and sentenced him to four years' and six months' imprisonment. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against this judgment. He complained in particular that the Regional Court had not discontinued the proceedings having regard to the circumstances in which the undercover agent had contacted his lawyer. On 12 January 2000, the Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) rejected the applicant's appeal on points of law. It expressed serious concern about the involvement of the undercover agent in the relationship between the defence counsel and the applicant, but found that in the present case there was nothing to show that during these meetings evidence had been obtained to the applicant's detriment. Moreover, the Hamburg Regional Court had sufficiently taken into account the intervention of the undercover agent when fixing the sentence. By a decision of 7 June 2000, notified to the applicant's counsel on 16 June 2000, the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht), sitting in a panel of three judges, declined to entertain the applicant's constitutional complaint. It found that it did not raise any fundamental constitutional issues. Furthermore it was not relevant for the protection of the applicant's basic rights since it had no prospects of success. The constitutional complaint was inadmissible as the applicant failed to substantiate the alleged violation of his constitutional rights and, consequently, did not meet the formal requirements under Articles 23 § 1 and 92 of the Federal Constitutional Court Act (Bundesverfassungsgerichtsgesetz). Moreover, the Federal Constitutional Court found that there was nothing to suggest that the applicant's basic or similar rights had been breached. The undercover agent had met the applicant's lawyer for the last time on 3 November 1998 in connection with the request for a retrial. On 4 November 1998 the drug deal had been carried out. There was no indication and it had not been alleged that after that date the undercover agent had performed further activities, in particular contacted the applicant's lawyer. Therefore at no time the applicant's right to an effective exercise of his defence rights had been infringed.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
76,001-81979,ENG,UKR,ADMISSIBILITY,2007,KIRILENKO v. UKRAINE,4,Inadmissible,Peer Lorenzen,"The applicant, Mr Viktor Ivanovich Kirilenko, is a Ukrainian national who was born in 1939 and lives in Simferopil. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented Mr Y. Zaytsev, their Agent, and Mrs I. Shevchuk, Head of the Office of the Government Agent before the European Court of Human Rights. Prior to July 1983 the applicant had been certified as falling within the “second category of invalidity” (друга група інвалідності) on account of a haematological disease. He was receiving a disability pension and earning occasional additional income collecting and selling wild produce. In July 1983 the applicant sustained an injury (concussion and bone fractures) in a car accident caused by Mr K., an employee of the Auto-transport unit of the Simferopil Health Department (“the ATU”; Автогосподарство Симферопольського міського управління охорони здоров’я), who was subsequently sentenced for dangerous driving. In the aftermath of the accident, the applicant was certified as falling within the “first category of invalidity” on account of the injury. However, in 1985 a medical commission restored him into the “second category”, having found that the remaining effects of the injury could not justify the attribution of the “first category”. The applicant, however, ceased collecting wild produce allegedly due to deterioration of his health condition. In January 1984 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against the ATU seeking compensation for his medical expenses and the loss of earnings. On 29 January 1985 the Kyivsky District Court of Simferopil (“the District Court”; Київський районний суд м. Симферополя) allowed the applicant’s claims in part. On 4 March 1985 the Crimean Regional Court (Кримський обласний суд) upheld this judgment and it became final. In 2001, pursuant the introduction of the new cassation procedure, the applicant lodged a cassation appeal against the above rulings, seeking higher payments. On 18 December 2001 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s request for leave to appeal in cassation. In November 1990 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against the ATU seeking additional compensations. On 10 January 1992 the District Court rejected this claim as unsubstantiated. On 9 March 1992 the Crimean Regional Court upheld this judgment and it became final. On 16 September 1996 the applicant instituted civil proceedings seeking to obtain additional compensation for the loss of earnings, medical and rehabilitation expenses and other payments from the ATU. In the course of the proceedings, the applicant amended his claims on three occasions. On 6 March 1997 the District Court rejected the applicant’s claims, finding that the applicant’s health condition was not connected to the accident and his disability category was not affected by the injury sustained. On 9 April 1997 the Supreme Court of the Crimea (Верховний суд Автономної Республіки Крим) upheld this judgment and it became final. On 1 August 1997 the Supreme Court of the Crimea quashed the above rulings following a protest (an extraordinary appeal) introduced by its Acting President and remitted the case for a fresh consideration. In particular, the court found that additional investigation was necessary into the specific health damage caused by the accident. In the course of subsequent proceedings, the courts ordered the total of six independent medical expert opinions, some of which contradicted the others, and interviewed six specialists involved in the applicant’s treatment. On 1 July 1998 the District Court rejected the applicant’s claims, finding, based on a medical assessment, that the accident had certain lasting effects on the applicant’s health, but they required no special treatment and were not linked to the damage claimed. On 19 August 1998 the Supreme Court of the Crimea quashed this decision and remitted the case for fresh examination. Subsequently, the court assumed first instance jurisdiction over the case. On 29 June 1999 the Supreme Court of the Crimea rejected the applicant’s claims. It found that part of them had been finally adjudicated in other proceedings brought in 1984 and 1990 (see sections B and C above). As regards the other claims, the court found no causal link between the effects of the accident on the applicant’s health and the expenses claimed. It further dismissed the claim for loss of earnings as unsubstantiated, since the applicant had subsisted on disability pension, while his produce collecting activities could not be regarded as “earnings”. On 27 October 1999 the Supreme Court of Ukraine quashed the judgment of 29 June 1999 and remitted the case for a fresh consideration. It instructed the trial court to assess the degree of work fitness lost by the applicant as a result of the accident, without regard to his prior disability, and to make an additional investigation into the importance of the produce collection as a source of the applicant’s income. On 18 April 2001 the Supreme Court of the Crimea, relying on a new medical expert opinion, decided that the injury resulting from the accident was sufficient to entitle the applicant to a “third category invalidity” (третя группа інвалідності) and that the applicant’s produce collecting activities could qualify as “lost earnings”. Therefore, the court awarded the applicant 1,128 hryvnyas in compensation. The applicant appealed, considering this sum insufficient. On 20 June 2001 the Supreme Court of Ukraine quashed this judgment and remitted the case for a fresh consideration, referring to several contradictions in the opinions of medical experts as to the applicant’s loss of work fitness and challenging the method of calculating the award. On 29 May 2002 the Crimean Court of Appeal (formerly the Supreme Court of the Crimea) rejected the applicant’s claims as unsubstantiated. The applicant appealed in cassation. On 25 July 2002 the court suspended the applicant’s cassation appeal and proposed that he rectify its formal shortcomings. On 2 September 2002 the court returned the appeal as “not lodged” on account of the applicant’s failure to rectify the above shortcomings. The applicant did not challenge this decision. Subsequently the applicant unsuccessfully attempted to re-lodge his appeal in cassation after the expiry of the statutory time-limit.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
77,001-93151,ENG,DEU,ADMISSIBILITY,2009,DITZ v. GERMANY,4,Inadmissible,Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"The applicants, Ms Nicole Ditz and Mr Sebastian Ditz, are German nationals who were born in 1978 and 1977 respectively and live in Hamelin. They were represented before the Court by Ms Eva Beate Bäumler, a lawyer practising in Hanover. On 19 August 2000 the applicants’ first child was born with severe physical disabilities, having, inter alia, no arms and hands, a shortened thigh and serious hip dysplasia. The applicants brought a civil action in the Hanover Regional Court, seeking alimony and compensation for non-pecuniary damage from the attending gynaecologist. They argued that, had the mother been informed about the disability, she would have opted for an abortion. During a hearing, the Regional Court conveyed to the parties its intention to first take evidence on the question of whether the gynaecologist had committed a grave diagnostic error. On 6 November 2003 the Regional Court informed the applicants that, contrary to its earlier intention, the taking of evidence would commence with the issue of whether an abortion would have been legally possible. On 17 March 2005 the Regional Court dismissed the action in its entirety. It considered that it could leave open the question of whether the gynaecologist had committed a grave diagnostic error as the alimony claim required proof of whether, had the parents been informed of the disability, an abortion would have been legally possible. The court found that, for the abortion to be legal, the applicants had to demonstrate that it would have been the only reasonable means to avert a risk for the mother’s life or severe interference with her physical or mental integrity. Referring to an expert report, the court found that the mother had not demonstrated that an abortion could have been legally possible. The expert had noted in his report that the applicants had failed to submit sufficient documents and provide sufficient facts from the time of the pregnancy to allow him to come to the conclusion that the requirements for a legal abortion were met. The applicants appealed against the judgment. On 28 July 2005 the Celle Court of Appeal notified the applicants of its intention to decide the appeal without conducting a hearing, giving the applicants two weeks to make further submissions. It informed the applicants that it was of the opinion that the Regional Court had correctly desisted from taking evidence on the alleged grave diagnostic error. As to their claim in respect of non-pecuniary damage, the Court of Appeal considered that the applicants had failed to sufficiently substantiate it; in particular, they had not explained how the shock had manifested itself and had not described the psychological condition of the mother after the birth of the child. With respect to the alimony claim, the Court of Appeal also confirmed that the Regional Court had been under no obligation to hear evidence on the alleged grave diagnostic error, as the lack of proof of the abortion’s legality already meant that the claim was unfounded and that an expert opinion on the existence of the grave diagnostic error was redundant. It also rejected the applicants’ complaint that they had not been granted a hearing as to the Regional Court’s decision to first take evidence on the question of whether the child could have been legally aborted. It observed that the applicants had had plenty of time to object to the Regional Court’s decision of 6 November 2003, but had chosen not to. In so far as the applicants challenged the expert report, the Court of Appeal held that the expert’s conclusions, though not clearly distinguishing between issues of law and fact, had been sufficiently clear. The expert had found that no documents or indications existed that demonstrated an elevated risk of grave interference with the mother’s mental integrity, either during the pregnancy or after the delivery. The Court of Appeal noted in that context that the parents had failed to submit further documentation, despite having been asked by the Regional Court to do so. Furthermore, the expert had sufficiently explained that an examination of the mother, four years after the delivery of the baby, would have been inconclusive without further documentary proof. On 22 August 2005 the applicants made further submissions to the Court of Appeal. On 6 September 2005 the Court of Appeal, referring to the reasoning set out in its decision of 28 July 2005, dismissed the appeal without holding a hearing, also dismissing the applicants’ further submissions contesting the expert report. On 31 October 2005 the Court of Appeal dismissed an objection alleging a violation of the right to be heard (Anhörungsrüge) as being manifestly illfounded. The applicants had been informed of the reasons why it intended to dismiss the appeal. It had addressed all the arguments put forward by the applicants, in particular the submissions concerning the claim for damages, the requirements of the legality of the abortion, the challenges against the expert report, and the alleged denial of the right to be heard. On 10 January 2006 the Federal Constitutional Court held that the constitutional complaint by the applicants had no prospect of success as there was no appearance of a violation of the right to be heard or the principle of equality of arms.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

On 20 January 1992 the applicant company was set up in the form of a closed joint-stock company. It was called the “Foreign Trade Stock Company 'Soyuzplodoimport'” (Внешнеэкономическое акционерное общество закрытого типа «Союзплодоимпорт», VAO “Soyuzplodoimport”), and was registered with the relevant state agency, namely the Moscow Registration Chamber. According to its memorandum of association, it was set up by several founders, including the State Foreign Trade Agency “Soyuzplodoimport”, which held 3,880 of its 17,000 shares. The memorandum of association provided that the applicant company was a “successor” to the State Foreign Trade Agency “Soyuzplodoimport”. 9. In 1998 the applicant company converted into an open joint-stock company. 10. On 24 December 1999 the general shareholders' meeting of the applicant company adopted a new memorandum of association. The company name was changed to OAO “Plodovaya Kompaniya” (ОАО «Плодовая компания»). The new memorandum of association contained a declaration that the applicant company was the successor of the State Foreign Trade Agency “Soyuzplodoimport”. 11. In the above period the applicant company notified the trademark registration authority that the trademarks of the State Foreign Trade Agency “Soyuzplodoimport” had changed ownership through succession and consequently obtained trademark certificates in its own name. It subsequently used the trademarks as collateral in a number of commercial transactions with third parties. 12. On 31 October 2000 the Deputy Prosecutor General challenged the applicant company's new memorandum of association, particularly the declaration of succession, before the Commercial Court of Moscow. 13. On 21 December 2000 the Commercial Court of Moscow declared the provision on succession null and void. It held that the applicant company had had no legal grounds to claim succession to the State Foreign Trade Agency “Soyuzplodoimport”. The applicant company had been set up as a new company and not converted from an existing one. It held that a mere declaration by the applicant company in its founding memorandum of association was insufficient to enable it to become the successor of another company. Likewise, it found that, although the applicant company had de facto acted as a successor before the trademark registration authorities and courts of arbitration, this was irrelevant to the establishment of corporate succession. 14. On 19 February 2001 the Appellate Board of the Commercial Court of Moscow examined the applicant company's appeal. Without entering into the merits it quashed the first-instance judgment and terminated the proceedings on the ground that the prosecutor's office did not have standing to bring proceedings. This decision entered into force on the same day. It was not appealed against either by a cassation appeal or by a separate appeal. 15. On 18 April 2001 the Moscow Registration Chamber registered the change of name of the State Foreign Trade Agency “Soyuzplodoimport”. Its new name was the Federal State Unitary Enterprise “Soyuzplodoimport” (Федеральное государственное унитарное предприятие «Внешнеэкономическое объединение Союзплодоимпорт»). 16. On 13 June 2001 the Deputy Prosecutor General submitted a request for supervisory review of the decision of 19 February 2001. 17. The applicant company was summoned to the hearing before the supervisory instance, but those summons were not served on it because it could not be found at its official address. The representatives of the applicant company learned about the hearing, however, submitted written comments on the merits of the case and attended the hearing. 18. On 16 October 2001 the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court of Russia examined the case in supervisory review proceedings. The applicant company was represented by the company's president, who made oral submissions before the Presidium. 19. The Presidium quashed the decision of 19 February 2001 and reinstated the first-instance judgment of 21 December 2000. On the procedural point, it held that the prosecutor's office was entitled by law to represent the State in proceedings before commercial courts where public or State interests were involved. It found that the proceedings at issue concerned State property, and that this provided sufficient grounds for the prosecutor to intervene. As to the merits of the case, the Presidium upheld the finding that the applicant company was not entitled to claim succession to the State Foreign Trade Agency “Soyuzplodoimport” because there had been no decision on the latter's conversion, and the applicant company itself had been created as a new entity and not as a result of any reorganisation of an existing legal person. Accordingly, the provisions on succession made in its memorandums of association were null and void. This decision entered into force on the same day and was not subject to further appeal. 20. The Civil Code of the Russian Federation provides that a legal person may be reorganised or liquidated upon a decision of its founders or its management body as authorised in its constitutional documents, or by a competent court in the circumstances provided for by law (Articles 57 and 61). In the event of reorganisation in a form of merger, conversion or accession, the assets of the legal person that ceases to exist are transferred pursuant to an act of transfer to a newly created legal person and, in the latter case – to an existing legal person. In the event of reorganisation in a form of division or separation, the assets of the reorganised legal person are divided and transferred pursuant to a separation balance sheet (Article 58). In the event of liquidation the legal person ceases to exist without succession (Article 61). 21. The Code of Commercial Procedure (no. 70-FZ of 5 May 1995, in force at the material time) established that final judgments and decisions of all commercial courts of the Russian Federation were amenable to supervisory review initiated on an application by the President of the Supreme Commercial Court or his deputy or by the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation or his deputy (Articles 180 and 181). The Code did not list the grounds for lodging an application for supervisory review: it merely specified that it could be lodged “also in connection with a request by a party to the proceedings” (Article 185 § 1). The summoning of parties to the hearing before the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court was to be at the discretion of the Presidium (Article 186 § 2). There was no time-limit for lodging an application for supervisory review, and, in principle, such applications could be lodged at any time after a judgment had become final.",[],[],[],['6'],['6-1'],[],0

De Gaetano,"12. The applicant, who was born in 1972, was detained in Schrassig (Luxembourg) Prison on the date the application was lodged. He is currently living in Peppange (Luxembourg). 13. On 15 December 1998 he was remanded in custody. 14. In a judgment of 22 October 2001, the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal sentenced him to fifteen years’ imprisonment, of which three years were suspended, for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, rape and false imprisonment accompanied by acts of torture, committed on 10 December 1998. 15. The applicant provided the Court with copies of several court decisions, given between 14 June 2001 and 13 April 2005, concerning the issue of his visiting rights in respect of his three minor children following his divorce, made final on 19 October 2000. 16. While in prison, the applicant submitted requests for conditional release, transfer to Givenich semi-open prison and temporary leave of absence (“prison leave”). The requests for prison leave are the subject of the present case. 17. The applicant stated that he had submitted a request for prison leave to the Attorney-General in October 2003. 18. At the request of the counselling service’s psychologist, the applicant explained on 16 October 2003 that he was requesting prison leave for one day and had no objection to being escorted while on leave. He stated that the reason for the request was to complete certain administrative formalities, which he listed as follows: “(i) go to a photographer or photo booth to obtain passport photos; (ii) go to the Transport Ministry to renew my driving licence (medical certificate already obtained); (iii) go to the embassy to renew my consular registration card; (iv) go to see Mr [B.] at Luxembourg police station, investigations division, to pick up an envelope containing documents needed by a former client; (v) go to see the manager of [B.] bank in Esch/Alzette; (vi) go to the tax office in Esch/Alzette; (vii) meet a group of friends in a restaurant near Esch/Alzette; (viii) go to my flat in Differdange to collect the remaining documents for the same client; (ix) take some measurements for items I might make in the [prison] workshop; (x) go to Differdange town hall for a personal meeting with the mayor; (xi) go to the home of Ms [S.] in Luxembourg to meet her husband; (xii) go to my lawyer’s office to hand over the missing documents for my former client; (xiii) if possible, go to the bookshop near [S.]’s house.” In his reply, the applicant stated further: “... Unfortunately, the civil damages are still far from being paid, as I have not even had enough funds to make a down-payment. At the moment I am still busy repaying my loans and other debts to the various authorities under the arrangements entered into with the legal departments in order to avoid an unending series of seizures of my property. ...” 19. On 29 October 2003 a psychologist issued a certificate stating that the applicant had begun a course of psychotherapy on 19 May 1999 which had been discontinued on 30 September 2002 for reasons beyond his control. She stressed that the applicant was anxious to understand what had driven him to commit the offences and to do everything possible to avoid reoffending. On 25 November 2003 a second psychologist, who certified that he had had regular meetings with the applicant since the beginning of 2003, agreed with the comments made in the certificate of 29 October 2003. 20. On 5 November 2003 the Attorney-General’s representative sent a memorandum to the prison governor stating, in particular, as follows: “... please inform the prisoner Thomas Boulois that by decision of the Prison Board [the] request for prison leave ... [is] refused in view of the risk of deportation (an application was made to the Ministry of Justice on 25 June 2003, but no decision has yet been taken). There is also a risk that the prisoner might abscond, given that he has failed to reflect on his crime. Before being allowed any privileges he must begin to pay the civil party.” 21. On 17 January 2004 the applicant reiterated his request, giving the same reasons and the same programme for the day’s prison leave. On 27 January 2004 his lawyer confirmed the request and added, inter alia, the following: “... granting [the applicant] a day’s prison leave during which he could begin to put his affairs in order with a view to leading an independent life [outside] prison, [would] not only aid [the applicant’s] rehabilitation and reintegration into society, but [would] also enable him to start paying damages to the civil party as quickly as possible. ...” 22. On 17 March 2004 the Attorney-General’s representative sent a memorandum to the prison governor containing the following passage: “... please inform the prisoner Thomas Boulois that by decision of the Prison Board the decision of 5 November 2003 refusing his request for prison leave ... remains valid.” 23. On 25 May 2004 the applicant lodged an application with the Administrative Court (tribunal administratif) for judicial review of the decisions of the Prison Board of 5 November 2003 and 17 March 2004. 24. At a hearing held on 6 December 2004, the Administrative Court raised of its own motion the question whether it had jurisdiction to examine the application for judicial review. The government, who had not raised an objection alleging lack of jurisdiction, left the matter to the discretion of the court. The applicant pleaded that the latter had jurisdiction. 25. On 23 December 2004 the Administrative Court declined jurisdiction to examine the application for judicial review, for the following reasons: “... A distinction must be made between administrative measures relating to the treatment of prisoners in prison (such as a decision to place them in a more secure wing of the prison, and in particular imposing a strict confinement regime – see Administrative Court ruling no. 14568 of 10 July 2002), which are administrative decisions taken in the context of the running of the prison service, and decisions which may alter the nature or scope of a sentence imposed by the ordinary courts, which should be regarded as judicial rather than administrative decisions. In the instant case it should be noted that the granting or refusal of the privilege of prison leave constitutes a measure which alters the ‘scope’ of the sentence imposed on the applicant by the ordinary court. Hence, the two decisions in question are judicial in nature. Accordingly, having regard to their nature as identified above, the impugned decisions cannot be the subject of an application to the administrative courts ...” 26. On 14 April 2005 the Higher Administrative Court (cour administrative) upheld that ruling in the following terms: “The [applicant] submitted that the court had erred in declining jurisdiction to examine his application for judicial review, arguing that: no other remedy existed in respect of such refusal, with the result that section 2(1) of the Law of 7 November 1996 on the organisation of the administrative courts should be applied; the impugned decisions did not alter the scope of the sentence; and the court had denied him justice in breach of Article [6 § 1] of the [Convention] by depriving him of a fair hearing. ... The [applicant]’s case concerns a request for prison leave, in other words, a decision which alters the terms of execution of the sentence imposed by the ordinary courts and which should therefore be classified as a judicial rather than an administrative decision. The expression ‘the scope of the sentence imposed’, used by the court, is not to be understood in the present case as the length of the sentence but as the manner of its execution in a broad sense. The Administrative Court was therefore correct in declining jurisdiction to examine the application. A finding by the administrative courts that they lack jurisdiction cannot be construed as a declaration of unwillingness on their part to rule on the issue; the allegation of a denial of justice should therefore be dismissed as unfounded. Article [6 § 1] of the [Convention] is not applicable in respect of a body which has no power to rule on the merits. ...” 27. On 11 August 2004 the applicant submitted a third request for prison leave, stating, inter alia, as follows: “... I have successfully attended several classes run by the CEP-L [Chamber of Employees] and would like to continue with a view to obtaining the corresponding diplomas. The diplomas concerned are in accounting and computer (PC) use. I completed the previous courses successfully, but if I am to achieve my aim it is now essential for me to be able to attend the classes of the autumn session at the CEP-L itself. ...” 28. In a decision of 21 September 2004, the request was refused on the ground that the applicant could attend courses in prison and that he had as yet made no substantial efforts towards paying compensation to the victim. The decision also referred to the reasoning of the decision of 5 November 2003. 29. On 14 October 2004 the applicant submitted a fourth request for prison leave – which he produced for the first time before the Grand Chamber – seeking permission to spend a day with his children over the St Nicholas weekend. 30. In a decision of 14 December 2004, the request was refused on the ground that the applicant’s visiting rights in respect of his children had not yet been clearly established. 31. In a fifth request submitted on 24 February 2005, the applicant stated, among other things, that he could not understand why, in view of the need for him to reintegrate into society, he had been refused permission to attend the final classes required in order to obtain the diplomas in accounting and computing. He added that the reason he had requested prison leave was to renew his identity papers and driving licence and find a solution regarding the repayment of his debts to the various institutions and the civil party. 32. On 23 March 2005 his request was refused for failure to give reasons. 33. On 12 July 2005 a sixth request for prison leave was refused on the ground that there was a risk that the applicant would not return to prison. 34. On 4 May 2006 a seventh request for prison leave was refused on the grounds that the applicant had been making no efforts, especially with regard to paying compensation to the civil party, and had been refusing to abide by the conditions imposed on him. 35. Following the refusal of 4 May 2006, the applicant applied to the Attorney-General’s Department on five occasions between 10 May and 29 October 2006. He requested assistance in putting in place a repayment plan appropriate to his circumstances and the demands of the civil party, and sought an explanation of the conditions imposed on him with a view to his reintegration into society, so that he could comply with them. On 6 November 2006 the Attorney-General’s representative wrote to the applicant informing him that, as matters stood, he did not intend to reply to the various letters, which, in his view, did not call for any comment. 36. On 20 November 2006 the Attorney-General acknowledged receipt of a request from the applicant for an interview and said that he would meet him during one of his forthcoming visits to the prison. According to the applicant, the meeting never took place. 37. On 31 October 2008 the Prison Board granted the applicant one day’s prison leave, subject to the condition that he would be collected from the prison and brought back there by his new girlfriend, at whose home he was to spend the day. 38. Between 12 December 2008 and 19 June 2009 the applicant was granted five periods of prison leave of two consecutive days, to be spent with his girlfriend. 39. On 20 March 2009 the applicant was transferred to Givenich semiopen prison. The same day, in a separate decision, he was granted ten days’ prison leave in order to look for work and complete various administrative formalities; it was also decided to place him under the semicustodial regime once he had found work. 40. On 24 June 2009 the applicant signed a vocational rehabilitation contract as a cook. 41. On 25 September 2009 his request for conditional release was granted. 42. In three decisions (dated 25 September and 11 December 2009 and 26 February 2010), the requests made by the applicant for suspension of his sentence, due to end on 12 October 2010, were refused. 43. On 10 February 2010 the applicant started up a business as a sole trader. 44. On 15 July 2010 the applicant’s sentence was suspended. According to his submissions, he left Givenich Prison definitively on that date. 45. Section 1 of the Law of 26 July 1986 on certain means of executing custodial sentences (“the 1986 Law”) lists the various arrangements which execution of a custodial sentence may entail: “The execution of a custodial sentence may entail one of the following: serving of the sentence in instalments, semi-custodial regime, prison leave, suspension of sentence, early release.” 46. Section 6 of the 1986 Law defines prison leave as follows: “Prison leave shall consist of permission to leave prison either for part of a day or for periods of twenty-four hours. The time shall count towards the length of the sentence.” 47. Section 7 of the 1986 Law provides as follows with regard to the objectives of prison leave: “This privilege may be granted to prisoners who are domiciled or resident in the country, either for family reasons or to make preparations for their rehabilitation and reintegration into professional life, or on a trial basis with a view to their conditional release.” 48. Section 8 of the 1986 Law provides that this measure may be granted to first offenders once one-third of their sentence has been served. 49. Section 13 of the 1986 Law provides as follows: “In applying the arrangements provided for by this Law, consideration shall be given to the personality of the prisoner, his or her progress and the risk of a further offence.” According to the comments on this provision accompanying the relevant bill when it was submitted, the granting of measures relating to the means of executing a sentence “will never be automatic and will ultimately remain at the discretion of the postsentencing authority, which will decide freely on the basis of the information it has obtained concerning the prisoner”. 50. Under the terms of the Grand-Ducal Regulation of 19 January 1989 laying down, inter alia, detailed arrangements for the granting of prison leave, such leave may be granted at the request of the prisoner concerned or his or her representative (Article 4); the request must be made in writing, unless the prisoner is unable or does not know how to write. The interval between periods of leave must be at least one month, except in special circumstances (Article 5). Where a request for prison leave is refused, no new request may be made within two months, unless new evidence comes to light (Article 6). 51. Section 12 of the 1986 Law states as follows: “In the case of custodial sentences of over two years ... the measures provided for by this Law ... shall be taken by the Attorney-General or his or her representative in accordance with the majority decision of a board comprising, in addition to the Attorney-General or his or her representative, a judge and a public prosecutor. ... The board shall be convened by the Attorney-General or his or her representative and shall be chaired by the judge. With the exception of the Attorney-General or his or her representative, the full members and their substitutes shall be appointed by ministerial order for a renewable three-year term.” 52. In Recommendation No. 30, set out in his activity report on the year from 1 October 2007 to 30 September 2008, the Ombudsman expressed the view that the system for the execution of sentences in Luxembourg needed to be overhauled, and advocated the creation of the office of post-sentencing judge. The latter would give decisions, open to appeal, on applications for prison leave following adversarial proceedings. 53. In his activity report on the year from 1 October 2009 to 30 September 2010, the Ombudsman took note of the fact that the Minister of Justice, in an article published in a Luxembourg daily newspaper, had spoken in favour of handing over to a judicial body some of the powers currently exercised by the Attorney-General’s representative with responsibility for the execution of sentences or by the Prison Board. On 22 December 2011 the Minister of Justice presented the broad outlines of the planned prison reform, which included a bill approved by the government at a Cabinet meeting on 16 December 2011 reforming the system of execution of sentences by establishing, inter alia, a postsentencing court. The bill must now go through the different stages of the legislative procedure. 54. There are two prisons in Luxembourg, with a prison population of around 700. Most prisoners are held in Luxembourg Prison, which is a closed institution. There is also a semiopen prison (Givenich Prison) which mainly houses prisoners approaching the end of their sentences or serving shorter sentences. Most leave the prison each day to go to work. 55. The Government stated that a distinction needed to be made between requests for prison leave made by inmates in Luxembourg Prison and those in Givenich. 56. In 2009, 146 requests for prison leave were granted and 169 refused; for 2010, the figures were 114 and 128 respectively. 57. The Government observed that numerous requests for prison leave were bound to fail as they were submitted before expiry of the statutory period. In other words, the prisoners concerned had not yet served one-third of their sentence (in the case of a first offender) or half their sentence (in the case of a repeat offender), or the request was made less than two months after notification of the refusal of a previous request. 58. In 2009, 376 requests for prison leave were granted and 192 refused; for 2010, the figures were 409 and 191 respectively. 59. The Recommendation states, inter alia, as follows: “The Committee of Ministers, under the terms of Article 15.b of the Statute of the Council of Europe, ... Considering that prison leave is one of the means of facilitating the social reintegration of the prisoner; Having regard to experience in this field, Recommends the governments of member States: 1. to grant prison leave to the greatest extent possible on medical, educational, occupational, family and other social grounds; 2. to take into consideration for the granting of leave: – the nature and seriousness of the offence, the length of the sentence passed and the period of detention already completed, – the personality and behaviour of the prisoner and the risk, if any, he may present to society, – the prisoner’s family and social situation, which may have changed during his detention, – the purpose of leave, its duration and its terms and conditions; 3. to grant prison leave as soon and as frequently as possible having regard to the aforementioned factors; 4. to grant prison leave not only to prisoners in open prisons but also to prisoners in closed prisons, provided that it is not incompatible with public safety; ... 9. to inform the prisoner, to the greatest extent possible, of the reasons for a refusal of prison leave; 10. to provide the means by which a refusal can be reviewed; ...” 60. The Recommendation, in its relevant parts, reads as follows: “The Committee of Ministers, under the terms of Article 15.b of the Statute of the Council of Europe, ... Bearing in mind the relevance of the principles contained ... in particular [in]: – Recommendation No. R (82) 16 on prison leave; ... 1. For the purposes of this recommendation, a ... long-term prisoner is one serving a prison sentence or sentences totalling five years or more. ... 2. The aims of the management of ... long-term prisoners should be: ... – to increase and improve the possibilities for these prisoners to be successfully resettled in society and to lead a law-abiding life following their release. ... 23.b. Particular efforts should be made to allow for the granting of various forms of prison leave, if necessary under escort, taking into account the principles set out in Recommendation No. R (82) 16 on prison leave. ...” 61. The Recommendation reads, inter alia, as follows: “The Committee of Ministers, under the terms of Article 15.b of the Statute of the Council of Europe, ... Stressing that the enforcement of custodial sentences and the treatment of prisoners necessitate taking account of the requirements of safety, security and discipline while also ... offer[ing] ... treatment programmes to inmates, thus preparing them for their reintegration into society; ... Endorsing once again the standards contained in the recommendations of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, ... and in particular ... Rec(2003)23 on the management by prison administrations of life sentence and other long-term prisoners; ... 103.2 As soon as possible after such admission, reports shall be drawn up for sentenced prisoners about their personal situations, the proposed sentence plans for each of them and the strategy for preparation for their release. 103.3 Sentenced prisoners shall be encouraged to participate in drawing up their individual sentence plans. 103.4 Such plans shall as far as is practicable include: ... d. preparation for release. ... 103.6 There shall be a system of prison leave as an integral part of the overall regime for sentenced prisoners. ... 107.1 Sentenced prisoners shall be assisted in good time prior to release by procedures and special programmes enabling them to make the transition from life in prison to a law-abiding life in the community. 107.2 In the case of those prisoners with longer sentences in particular, steps shall be taken to ensure a gradual return to life in free society. ...”",[],[],[],['6'],['6-1'],[],0
80,001-90293,ENG,RUS,ADMISSIBILITY,2008,GONCHAROVY v. RUSSIA,4,Inadmissible,Anatoly Kovler;Christos Rozakis;Dean Spielmann;Elisabeth Steiner;George Nicolaou;Giorgio Malinverni;Sverre Erik Jebens,"The applicants, Mr Nikolay Stepanovich Goncharov and Mr Ivan Stepanovich Goncharov are Russian nationals who were born in 1947 and 1955 respectively and live in the Smolensk Region. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr P. Laptev and Ms V. Milinchuk, former Representatives of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 19 February 1981 the applicants were arrested on suspicion of having committed several crimes. They were detained pending investigation. On 26 May 1982 the Kaluga Regional Court convicted the first applicant of unlawful carriage of firearms, forgery, death threats and misappropriation (Articles 218, 196, 175, 96 and 207 of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (“RSFSR”) Criminal Code, hereinafter the “Criminal Code”) and the second applicant of forgery and misappropriation (Articles 196 and 96 of the Criminal Code). The Regional Court further acquitted the applicants of several other crimes. The applicants were sentenced to one year and three months’ imprisonment and one year’s imprisonment respectively. The applicants were released in the courtroom. On 28 July 1982 the Supreme Court of the RSFSR upheld the above judgment on appeal. On 1 April 1991 the first applicant applied to the Supreme Court of the RSFSR requesting the court to initiate a supervisory review of his criminal case, to quash the judgment of 26 May 1982, as upheld on 28 July 1982, and to terminate the criminal proceedings against him owing to the absence of corpus delicti in his actions. On an unspecified date the President of the Supreme Court of the RSFSR lodged an application for supervisory review of the judgment of 26 May 1982, as upheld on 28 July 1982. On 25 September 1991 the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the RSFSR quashed the judgment of 26 May 1982, as upheld on 28 July 1982, by way of supervisory review. The Supreme Court found that the above judgment could not be considered lawful and well-founded At the same time, the Presidium left the remainder of the judgment, that is the acquittal part, in force. On 25 November 1991 the Prosecutor of the Smolensk Region discontinued the criminal proceedings in respect of the first applicant partly for want of proof of a crime and partly on the ground that further prosecution was time-barred. The criminal proceedings against the second applicant were discontinued partly because of the lack of corpus delicti in his actions and partly because further prosecution was time-barred. The applicants appealed against the above decision. In their appeal they expressed discontent with the grounds given for termination of the criminal proceedings against them and insisted on the remittal of their case to the court for its examination on the merits. As a result, on 10 January 1992 the Prosecutor of the Smolensk Region quashed the decision of 25 November 1991. The preliminary investigation into the case was assigned to the Bryansk Transport Prosecutor’s Office. On 25 August 1992 and 15 May 1993 the Bryansk Transport Prosecutor’s Office again terminated the criminal proceedings against the applicants on the same grounds as previously. However, on 4 September 1992 and 23 October 1998 respectively the Moscow Transport Prosecutor’s Office quashed the above decisions on appeal and resumed the preliminary investigation. The Moscow Transport Prosecutor’s Office noted on both occasions that a criminal case could be terminated on nonexonerative grounds, such as a time-bar on further prosecution, only with the consent of the prosecuted person. As the applicants had never agreed to the termination of the case on this ground the investigation would have to be continued. On 18 February 1999 the investigator made the applicants sign a written undertaking not to leave the town. After the completion of the preliminary investigation, on 30 August 1999 the case was remitted to the Monastyrshinskiy District Court of the Smolensk Region for examination on the merits. Since the applicants refused to attend the preparatory hearing, the Monastyrshinskiy District Court decided on 15 November 1999 to change the above preventive measure to detention on remand. The second applicant was remanded in custody on 17 November 1999; however, on the same day the District Court ordered his release subject to an undertaking not to leave the town. On 7 December 1999 the Smolensk Regional Court upheld on appeal the decision of 15 November 1999 in respect of the first applicant. On 3 March 2000 the first applicant was detained. On 7 March 2000 the applicants consented to termination of the criminal proceedings against them owing to the expiry of the statutory limitation period for their criminal prosecution. On the same day the Monastyrshinskiy District Court of the Smolensk Region in compliance with Article 5 § 1 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the RSFSR discontinued the criminal proceedings against the applicants for being time-barred. The first applicant was released from detention. On 4 July 2000 the Smolensk Regional Court upheld the above decision on appeal. The first applicant challenged the lawfulness of the decision of 15 November 1999, as upheld on 7 December 1999, before the Presidium of the Smolensk Regional Court. On 15 June 2005 the Presidium of the Smolensk Regional Court acknowledged that the decisions in question had been unlawful and accordingly quashed them by way of supervisory review. Section VI, Chapter 30, of the 1960 Code of Criminal Procedure (Уголовно-процессуальный кодекс РСФСР), as in force at the material time, allowed certain officials to challenge a judgment which had become effective and to have the case reviewed on points of law and procedure. The supervisory review procedure (Articles 371-83 of the Code) is distinct from proceedings in which a case is reviewed in the light of newly established facts (Articles 384-90). However, similar rules apply to both procedures (Article 388). Under the terms of Article 356 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a judgment takes effect and is enforceable from the date on which the appeal court renders its decision or, if no appeal has been lodged, once the timelimit for appeal has expired. “The grounds for quashing or varying a judgment [on supervisory review] are the same as [those for setting aside judgments (which have not taken effect) on appeal] ...” “The grounds for quashing or varying a judgment on appeal are as follows: (i) prejudicial or incomplete investigation or pre-trial or court examination; (ii) inconsistency between the facts of the case and the conclusions reached by the court; (iii) a grave violation of procedural law; (iv) misapplication of [substantive] law; (v) discrepancy between the sentence and the seriousness of the offence or the convicted person’s personality.” Article 371 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provided that the power to lodge a request for a supervisory review could be exercised by the Prosecutor-General, the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation or their respective deputies in relation to any judgment other than those of the Presidium of the Supreme Court, and by the presidents of the regional courts in respect of any judgment of a regional or subordinate court. A party to criminal or civil proceedings could solicit the intervention of those officials for a review. Article 373 of the Code of Criminal Procedure did not set a limitation period for lodging an application for a supervisory review that might be beneficial to a convicted person. Under Articles 374, 378 and 380 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a request for supervisory review was to be considered by the judicial board (the Presidium) of the competent court. The court could examine the case on the merits and was not bound by the scope and grounds of the request for supervisory review. The Presidium could dismiss or grant the request. If it dismissed the request, the earlier judgment remained in force. If it granted the request, the Presidium could decide to quash the judgment and terminate the criminal proceedings, to remit the case for a new investigation, to order a fresh court examination at any instance, to uphold a first-instance judgment reversed on appeal, or to vary or uphold any of the earlier judgments. Article 380 §§ 2 and 3 provided that the Presidium could, in the same proceedings, reduce a sentence or amend the legal classification of a conviction or sentence to the defendant’s advantage. If it found a sentence or legal classification to be too lenient, it was obliged to remit the case for a new examination. Under Article 331 of the Code of Criminal Procedure an appeal against a decision of a first-instance court (including an order authorising or extending pre-trial detention) lay to a higher court. It had to be lodged within ten days and examined within the same time-limit as an appeal against a judgment on the merits. The State or regional treasury is liable – irrespective of any fault by State officials – for the damage sustained by an individual on account of unlawful criminal prosecution, unlawful application of a preventive measure in the form of placement in custody or an undertaking not to leave the place of residence, or an unlawful administrative penalty in the form of detention or community work (Article 1070 § 1 of the Civil Code). A court may hold the tortfeasor liable for non-pecuniary damage incurred by an individual through actions impairing his or her personal non-property rights, such as the right to personal integrity and the right to liberty of movement (Articles 150 and 151). Non-pecuniary damage must be compensated for irrespective of the tortfeasor’s fault in the event of unlawful conviction or prosecution, unlawful application of a preventive measure in the form of placement in custody or an undertaking not to leave the place of residence, or an unlawful administrative penalty in the form of detention or community service (Article 1100 § 2).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
81,001-24051,ENG,RUS,ADMISSIBILITY,2004,KATAYEVA and KATAYEV v. RUSSIA,4,Inadmissible,,"The applicants, Mrs Klara Khudovna Katayeva and Mr Movladin Khasanovich Katayev, are Russian nationals who were born in 1940 and 1948 respectively and live in the Republic of Adygeya. The applicants are married. The respondent Government were represented by Mr P. A. Laptev, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicants are a family of refugees from Chechnya. They brought a court action against authorities, claiming 92,000 US dollars for the loss of their real property left in Chechnya, including a house and a chicken farm, and 240,000 Russian Roubles (“RUR”) for the loss of their movable effects. On 23 June 1999 the Maykop Town Court of the Republic of Adygeya (“the Town Court”) dismissed the applicants’ claim in their absence, having heard the respondent authorities. The court referred to the applicants’ request to consider the case in their absence. The court found that in 1998 the authorities had paid the applicants RUR 79,676 for the loss of their real property and RUR 12,524 for the movable items left in Chechnya, which they had proved to have owned in accordance with a special governmental decree on compensation for the material losses of Chechen refugees. The court found that the applicants had proved that they had a flat of 38.4 square metres, for which they had been awarded the above sums. The court held that the applicants had not substantiated their case to the extent that they had claimed to have lost further real or movable items. The applicants appealed against the above judgment, stating that the court had failed to assess properly the evidence in the case. On 17 August 1999 the Supreme Court of the Republic of Adygeya rejected the appeal in the absence of the applicants and in the presence of the governmental authorities, finding that the applicants had not proved the alleged pecuniary damage. The court also stated that Russian legislation provided for no right to claim non-pecuniary damage in connection with the alleged violation of property rights. On 13 January 2001 the Deputy President of the Supreme Court of Russia lodged with the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation an application for supervisory review of the case, requesting the quashing of the decisions of 23 June and 17 August 1999 on the ground, inter alia, that although the applicants had requested examination of the case in their absence, they had not been properly notified of the hearing in breach of Article 157 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This resulted in the applicants’ nonattendance, which, in turn, adversely affected the fairness of the trial. On 26 February 2001 the Supreme Court of Russia granted the application, quashed the said decisions and remitted the case for a fresh examination at first instance. On 30 January 2002 the Town Court refused to examine the applicants’ case on the ground of the applicants’ persistent failure, namely on five occasions, to appear before the court. It appears that the applicants did not appeal and the decision came into force. On 31 May 2002 the Deputy President of the Supreme Court of Russia lodged an application by way of a supervisory review, requesting the Supreme Court of the Republic of Adygeya to quash the decision of 30 January 2002 on the grounds of the court’s failure to deal properly with the applicants’ reluctance to attend the court hearings, for example by examining the case in their absence, and the court’s failure to send them a summons to appear to all known addresses and not just to one address. On 27 August 2002 the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Adygeya granted the application, quashed the decision and remitted the case to the first-instance court for a fresh examination. On 10 October 2002 the Town Court dismissed the applicants’ claims. The court observed that on 29 July 1998 the applicants received compensation of RUR 79,676 and RUR 12,524 for the loss of their real property and for the movable items left in Chechnya. The court next held that the applicants had not substantiated their case to the extent that they had claimed to have lost further real or movable items. Their claims were accordingly rejected. The applicants, who were duly notified of the hearing, failed to attend it. The applicants appealed against the judgment. It appears that they did not express in their appeal any concern about the first-instance court’s examination of the case in their absence. On 5 November 2002 the Supreme Court of the Republic of Adygeya rejected the appeal and upheld the judgment of 10 October 2002. It appears that neither the applicants nor the respondents attended the appeal hearing. The applicants were involved in a number of other legal disputes with the authorities concerning various social benefits, including, in particular, their claims for a new car, higher salary and pension, and index-linked savings. The domestic courts examined those claims and dismissed them as unfounded.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
82,001-105336,ENG,CHE,CHAMBER,2011,CASE OF ADAMOV v. SWITZERLAND,3,No violation of Art. 5-1;Remainder inadmissible,András Sajó;David Thór Björgvinsson;Françoise Tulkens;Giorgio Malinverni;Guido Raimondi;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque,"7. The applicant was born in 1939 and lives in Moscow. 8. In 2004 criminal proceedings were brought against him in the United States of America. They concerned his alleged misappropriation of funds provided to Russia by the USA during his term as Russian Minister for Energy. 9. On 11 February 2005 he obtained a four-month Swiss visa issued by the Swiss Embassy in Moscow, valid until 10 June 2005. On the visa application form he had indicated, without being more specific, that the main purpose of his journey to Switzerland was to visit his daughter, who was living in Bern. 10. On 21 February 2002 criminal proceedings were opened against the applicant’s daughter, by the competent investigating judge for the Canton of Bern, on a charge of money laundering. The suspicions notably concerned sums of money she had allegedly received from her father. 11. On 5 April 2005, when consulting the case file concerning the criminal proceedings against the applicant’s daughter, her former lawyer informed the investigating judge that the applicant visited Switzerland from time to time and that he agreed to be questioned in connection with the case in question. The applicant then indicated to his daughter’s lawyer that he was prepared to come to Switzerland to be questioned by the investigating judge. He explained that it would suit him if the questioning took place between 20 April and 6 May 2005. 12. On 15 April 2005 the investigating judge thus suggested two possible dates to the new lawyer representing the applicant’s daughter, namely 1 and 2 May 2005. 13. After arriving in Switzerland on 20 April 2005 the applicant expressed, through his daughter’s lawyer, his preference for 2 May 2005 at 2 p.m. He asked the investigating judge to confirm that date. 14. On the same day the judge duly issued a summons using the appropriate form in accordance with practice in the Canton of Bern. The hearing was scheduled for 2 May 2005 and the summons indicated that any delay in appearance or unjustified absence from the hearing would entail a penalty, with the possibility of using force in the event of non-appearance. The summons, which was addressed to the applicant, was served at his daughter’s private address in Bern. A copy was also sent to her lawyer for information purposes. 15. On 28 April 2005 the investigating judge contacted a public prosecutor in Pennsylvania, USA, to find out any information that might be useful in the proceedings against the applicant’s daughter. During the conversation, the judge mentioned that he would be questioning the applicant on 2 May 2005 at 2 p.m. 16. On 29 April 2005 the US Department of Justice sent the Swiss Federal Office of Justice a request for the applicant’s provisional arrest in accordance with the extradition treaty of 14 November 1990 between Switzerland and the USA. 17. On the same day the Federal Office of Justice (mutual legal assistance division) issued an “urgent” order for the applicant’s arrest that was sent to the investigating judge for the Canton of Bern. 18. On 2 May 2005 at 2 p.m. the applicant appeared before the investigating judge for the Canton of Bern to give evidence in the proceedings against his daughter. When asked why he was in Switzerland he replied that he was visiting for private reasons but also for business. 19. After the interview, which lasted about four hours, the investigating judge notified the applicant that he was under arrest. Two police officers of the Canton of Bern, who had been waiting in a neighbouring room for the interview to finish, immediately took him to the regional prison of Bern. 20. On 3 May 2005 the Federal Office of Justice issued an order for the applicant’s provisional detention pending extradition and it was served on the applicant the next day. 21. On 17 May 2005 Russia also applied for his extradition. 22. On the same day, the applicant lodged an appeal with the Appellate Division of the Federal Criminal Court. 23. During his detention the applicant wrote an article, which was published on 6 June 2005 in the Moscow daily newspaper Izwestija. He explained that his trip was connected to two projects on which he was working at the time, concerning the export of energy by Russia and technological cooperation, in particular with an energy supplier based in Switzerland. 24. On 9 June 2005 the Federal Criminal Court upheld the applicant’s appeal and set aside the extradition arrest order against him. The court took the view that the applicant had been in Switzerland for questioning in the context of criminal proceedings against his daughter, that the summons for the interview of 2 May 2005 should have been served on him through mutual assistance channels and that the protection afforded by the safe-conduct clause, deriving from the requirement of good faith, was also valid for a person examined as a witness who had not been summoned through mutual assistance channels but who had appeared “spontaneously” in Switzerland to give evidence. 25. On 17 June 2005 the Federal Office of Justice appealed before the Federal Court against the Federal Criminal Court’s decision. 26. On 24 and 27 June 2005 the US authorities filed a formal request, dated 2 June 2005, for the applicant’s extradition to the USA. 27. On 14 July 2005 the First Public Law Division of the Federal Court upheld the appeal of the Federal Office of Justice. 28. The Federal Court basically took the view that the applicant had been visiting Switzerland for private purposes – to see his daughter – and for business. In its view, the Federal Criminal Court had clearly made an erroneous and incomplete assessment of the facts in finding that the applicant had come to Switzerland in order to give evidence as a witness in criminal proceedings. It was not therefore appropriate to apply Article 12 of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal matters of 20 April 1959 or Article 73 of the Federal Law on International Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (see paragraphs 31-32 below). The case was referred back to the Federal Criminal Court for examination of the applicant’s other arguments (breach of the Russian Government’s immunity under international law, and the allegedly political nature of the criminal proceedings against him in the USA). 29. The applicant was held in custody until 30 December 2005 and then extradited to the Russian Federation pursuant to an administrative decision of the Federal Court of 22 December 2005. That court, unlike the administrative authority, the Federal Office of Justice, found that priority had to be given to the Russian extradition request, as the applicant was a Russian national and stood accused of committing criminal acts mainly in that country. 30. In a decision of 6 December 2007 the Federal Criminal Court dismissed, at last instance, a request by the applicant for compensation in respect of his detention pending extradition. The court found that his detention had not been unlawful. 31. Article 12 of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal matters of 20 April 1959, to which both Switzerland and the Russian Federation are parties, contains a safe-conduct clause. That Article reads as follows: “1. A witness or expert, whatever his nationality, appearing on a summons before the judicial authorities of the requesting Party shall not be prosecuted or detained or subjected to any other restriction of his personal liberty in the territory of that Party in respect of acts or convictions anterior to his departure from the territory of the requested Party. 2. A person, whatever his nationality, summoned before the judicial authorities of the requesting Party to answer for acts forming the subject of proceedings against him, shall not be prosecuted or detained or subjected to any other restriction of his personal liberty for acts or convictions anterior to his departure from the territory of the requested Party and not specified in the summons. 3. The immunity provided for in this article shall cease when the witness or expert or prosecuted person, having had for a period of fifteen consecutive days from the date when his presence is no longer required by the judicial authorities an opportunity of leaving, has nevertheless remained in the territory, or having left it, has returned.” 32. Section 73 of the Federal Law on international mutual assistance in criminal matters of 20 March 1981 contains a provision on safe conduct in Switzerland: “1. A person habitually resident abroad and who appears in Switzerland in a criminal case pursuant to a summons may neither be prosecuted nor restricted in his personal freedom on the basis of reasons that pre-date his entry into Switzerland. 2. A person being prosecuted shall enjoy no safe conduct in respect of the offences specified in the summons. 3. The safe conduct provided for in paragraph 1 shall cease when the person leaves Switzerland and at the latest three days after he is permitted to leave by the summoning authorities.” 33. The object and purpose of the safe-conduct clause were explained as follows by a Federal Court judgment of 26 April 1978 (ATF 104 Ia 448): ...” 34. In an unpublished judgment of 17 May 1995 (1P.289/1995), the Federal Court had occasion to develop its case-law on safe-conduct clauses as follows: ...”",[],[],[],['5'],['5-1'],[],0
83,001-22320,ENG,SWE,ADMISSIBILITY,2002,JAVANMARDI and AHMADI v. SWEDEN,4,Inadmissible,Nicolas Bratza,"The applicants, Mrs Marjan Javanmardi and Mr Ahad Ahmadi, are Iranian nationals, who were born in 1972 and 1968 respectively and live in Umeå, Sweden. They are represented before the Court by Ms L. Isaksson, a lawyer practising in the same town. The applicants left Iran and arrived in Sweden on 14 April 1999 with a visa authorising them to remain in Sweden for 30 days. On 18 May 1999 they applied for political asylum and a residence permit, invoking the following circumstances. The first applicant had, as a midwife at the Iranian Navy Muslim Hospital in Shiraz, carried out an illegal abortion at the hospital on a friend of hers, who was unmarried and politically active. For a few years the applicants had supported this friend financially in her political activities. The friend held views which were close to those of the Moujahadin and obtained help from the applicants for the printing of a political publication. As the first applicant’s superior found out about the abortion she was reported to the police. Allegedly, she was arrested and detained for 48 hours. She claims that she was beaten during that period. She was released on bail following the payment of a large sum by her father. Both applicants then left Iran for Sweden. Thereafter, the security guards visited her parents’ home on several occasions and looked for her at the hospital and at the university where she had obtained her degree. Her father was interrogated for 5 hours by the police in order to obtain information about her whereabouts. This was not the first time the applicants had sought entry into Sweden. The first applicant had unsuccessfully applied for a visa once in 1996, once in 1997 and once again in 1998. The second applicant applied twice in 1993, but without success. A further application for a visa had been rejected in 1994 but a second application made in the same year had been granted. The second applicant applied for a residence permit in order to settle with his mother and brothers and sisters. The application was rejected. He avoided returning to Iran but, following his arrest on suspicion of shop lifting, he was expelled in November 1994. His applications for a visa in 1996 and 1997 were rejected. On 19 November 1999 the National Immigration Board (Statens invandrarverk) refused the applicants’ above-mentioned application of 18 May 1999 for asylum and residence in Sweden and ordered their expulsion to Iran. The couple were prohibited from re-entering Sweden for 2 years. The National Immigration Board observed that the first applicant did not appear to have been of significant interest to the Iranian authorities since the couple had left Iran lawfully with passports issued in their own names. The couple only applied for asylum 5 weeks after arriving in Sweden. The applicants had never been active in any political party or organisation. While they asserted that they had contributed financially to the printing of a political publication, they were not able to identify the party or organisation, nor the contents of the publication. Nor had they claimed that the Iranian authorities knew of this. Although abortion was illegal in Iran, it was a frequent occurrence and was seldom pursued by the Iranian authorities and prosecution could be avoided by paying bribes. In any event, the offence in question was only liable to punishment by fines or imprisonment. An appeal by the applicants to the Aliens Appeals Board (Utlänningsnämnden) was rejected on 22 December 2000. The applicants then requested a fresh examination of their application by the Aliens Appeals Board, claiming that the first applicant suffered from a psychotic health condition, which had its background in her experience in Iran. She had been treated at a psychiatric hospital in November and was readmitted on 29 December 2000. The applicants relied on a medical certificate of 2 January 2001, which stated that the first applicant had had psychological problems over the past six months. She described herself as being persecuted and monitored by Iranian spies and had given a strong impression that she was suffering from anxiety and desperation, with a paranoid psychotic character. She had hallucinated in particular about her superior at the hospital who had reported her to the police. On the whole, she displayed unequivocal psychotic symptoms which could have been caused by stress and pressures and was in need of acute psychiatric care. Her condition pointed to a distinct risk of suicide. The doctor recommended that the first applicant continue to undergo psychiatric care and advised against burdensome transportation. On 19 January 2000 the first applicant was discharged as she was no longer considered suicidal and since her husband could look after her. On 29 January 2001 the Aliens Appeals Board rejected the renewed request, finding that neither the information in the medical certificate nor the other material submitted in the case were of such a character as to warrant granting the couple a residence permit on humanitarian grounds. On 1 February 2001 the applicants lodged an application complaining that, if expelled to Iran, the first applicant would risk the death penalty, corporal punishment, torture and other forms of ill-treatment and detention. Her mental health was such that expulsion would violate Article 3. Moreover, they requested the Court to indicate to the Swedish authorities not to execute the order to expel them to Iran. On 4 February 2001 the first applicant was again committed to the psychiatric ward on her husband’s initiative since she was suffering from a depressive psychosis. On 16 February 2001 the parties were informed that the acting President had decided not to grant the Rule 39 request with respect to the husband and was not minded to apply Rule 39 with respect to the wife in the absence of more specific documentary evidence in support of her account about the abortion, her detention, the payment of bail by her father or the proceedings (investigation/charges) against her. In response, the applicants submitted two statements dated 9 and 12 February 2001 by Professor J. Hjärpe of the Department of Religious History, Section of Islamology, at the University of Lund, Sweden. They also supplied a medical certificate dated 5 February 2001. According to the medical certificate, the first applicant’s condition had worsened despite being given appropriate medication. When examined on 4 February she was found to be autistic and suffering from hallucinations. She was also deeply depressed. In conclusion, the Chief Doctor stated that the patient suffered from an illness of a depressive nature with strong psychotic symptoms. Despite treatment with adequate medication, her condition had lately worsened. The patient was in need of care at a closed psychiatric ward and was at great risk of committing suicide. New forms of treatment were being considered beginning with electro-treatment, which needed to be carried out urgently. On 8 March 2001 the first applicant was diagnosed as suffering from severe depression. She was found to be in a therapy-resistant condition and required continuing specialist care. There was an imminent risk of suicide but, thanks to her husband, it was possible to treat her as an outpatient. She was last discharged on 23 March 2001. On 12 April 2001 the Chamber considered the above Rule 39 request with respect to the first applicant, Mrs Marjan Javanmardi. The Chamber found it desirable to continue the deliberations at a later date and, to this end, decided to apply provisionally Rule 39 until its next meeting to be held on 3 May 2001. On the latter date the Chamber rejected the Rule 39 request with respect to the first applicant.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

85,001-22345,ENG,GBR,ADMISSIBILITY,2002,IVISON v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,4,Inadmissible,Gaukur Jörundsson;Nicolas Bratza,"The application was originally introduced by Irene Ivison, a United Kingdom national, born in 1946 and living in Sheffield. Following her death in or about October 2000, her daughter Rebecca Ivison has expressed her intention of continuing the application. She is represented before the Court by Mrs Mary Cunneen, legal director of Liberty, London. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. Fiona Ivison, the sister of the applicant, was born in 1976 and killed in 1993. In 1990, Fiona started associating with two older men, Mr B and Mr T. She had sex with them and smoked cannabis. On 8 November 1990, she took an overdose of paracetamol tablets following an argument with her mother. She was seen by an adolescent psychiatrist who found no ascertained evidence of mental illness and attributed her conduct to “rebellion in the context of a liberal household”. On 12 December 1990, Fiona was referred to the social services. The applicant’s mother sought the help of the South Yorkshire Police and the Sheffield Social Services repeatedly in relation in particular to her concerns about Fiona’s contacts with B and T. Though she told the police after each occasion that she was aware that Fiona had passed the night at the men’s flats, she stated that she was told that they could do nothing as Fiona refused to complain. On 18 November 1991, a case conference was convened by Fiona’s social worker using child protection law. It was attended by four social workers, two police officers from the sexual offences and child abuse unit and the applicant. It was decided that, first, the police officer would liase with the South Yorkshire Police Drug Squad about Fiona’s exposure to drugs and talk to T to reinforce concern about his relationship with Fiona and, secondly, the social worker would continue working with Fiona in the hope that the latter would begin to recognise the risks to which she was exposed because of her relationship with T. In March 1992 the applicant’s mother wrote to the police and received a reply to the effect that “her comments had been passed on to the officers in the case”. The applicant’s mother was not aware of any action being taken. In April 1992 Fiona, now aged 16, left home to live with T. However, in spring 1993 she returned home. In late November 1993 however Fiona began working as a prostitute (unbeknown to her mother) on B’s instructions. On Friday, 17 December 1993, Fiona left home in the evening telling her mother that she would not return that night. When she had not returned by Sunday evening, 19 December, her mother reported her missing to the police. On 20 December, she was taken to the mortuary where she identified the body of a girl found on 18 December 1993 as being Fiona. Fiona had been killed by a client, D, who hit her head repeatedly on the floor. D was arrested on 23 December 1993. An inquest into Fiona’s death was opened on 6 January 1994 at the Coroner’s Court in Doncaster. Since the Coroner had been informed that D had been charged with murder, the inquest was adjourned. On 7 January 1994, a death certificate was issued to the effect that Fiona had died of head injuries. The inquest was not resumed in the light of the criminal proceedings. In February 1995 D pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. On 1 September 1995, the applicant’s mother wrote to the Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police raising various questions about the lack of police action before Fiona’s death, including a specific question as to why the Child Abduction Act had not been used. On 13 November 1995 she received a reply in which a representative of the police referred to the difficulties of applying various provisions of the criminal law in this case, but acknowledged “with the benefit of hindsight that more could have been done to prevent <Fiona> from being drawn into the maelstrom of drugs and vice.” On 16 December 1996, the applicant’s mother issued a writ in the High Court against the South Yorkshire Police and the Sheffield Social Services claiming damages for negligence. She applied for legal aid, submitting a statement of case in which she alleged that the police and social services had been aware of her daughter’s connection with two men with criminal records and had been warned that she was being led into underage sex and drugs. It was argued that there was no absolute immunity against suing the police, this depending on sufficient proximity existing between the parties, and that in this case the police and social services should have taken decisive action to protect Fiona from these men and prevented her from drifting into prostitution with its inevitable consequences. On the form where it was required to estimate prospects of success of the action, the solicitor indicated that it was not possible to say. On 17 December 1996, the Legal Aid Board area office refused the applicant’s mother legal aid for these proceedings, stating that “on the information submitted it is considered that you are unlikely to succeed in establishing negligence either in relation to your daughter’s death or in relation to your own post-traumatic stress”. On 29 January 1997, after a hearing at which the applicant’s mother and her legal representative had attended to make representations as to why legal aid should be granted, the Legal Aid Board area committee rejected her appeal on the ground that it had no reasonable prospects of success. On 20 February 1997, the applicant’s mother was advised by counsel that the common law position was such as to preclude her from pursuing a claim for damages in the domestic courts. The applicant’s mother made requests to various authorities for information about the background to and circumstances of Fiona’s death. By letter dated 12 August 1998, Sheffield Social Service informed her that Fiona’s file would have been destroyed in December 1996, pursuant to a three year rule applying to persons who were not on a child protection register or otherwise in the care of the social services. By letter dated 5 February 1999, the applicant’s mother was informed by the South Yorkshire Police that records existed holding details of the enquiry into Fiona’s murder, but that they were not in a position to give any information additional to the extensive material provided during the police investigation by the Senior Investigating Officer. By letter dated 8 December 1999, the solicitors for the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police disputed that they were under an obligation to provide any further information or documents, and stated that the Chief Constable would however do so if ordered by a court. Following further requests to the social services, documents from the Child Protection Team, including the case conference minutes, were given to the applicant’s mother on 13 December 1999. In England and Wales, there is no single tort which imposes liability to pay compensation for civil wrongs. Instead there are a series of separate torts, for example, trespass, conversion, conspiracy, negligence and defamation. Negligence arises in specific categories of situations. These categories are capable of being extended. There are three elements to the tort of negligence: a duty of care, breach of the duty of care and damage. The duty of care may be described as the concept which defines the categories of relationships in which the law may impose liability on a defendant in damages if he or she is shown to have acted carelessly. To show a duty of care, the claimant must show that the situation comes within an existing established category of cases where a duty of care has been held to exist. In novel situations, in order to show a duty of care, the claimant must satisfy a threefold test, establishing: – that damage to the claimant was foreseeable; – that the claimant was in an appropriate relationship of proximity to the defendant; and, – that it is fair, just and reasonable to impose liability on the defendant. These criteria apply to claims against private persons as well as claims against public bodies. The leading case is Caparo Industries v. Dickman ([1990] 2 AC 605). If the courts decide that as a matter of law there is no duty of care owed in a particular situation, that decision will (subject to the doctrine of precedent) apply in future cases where the parties are in the same relationship. In Hill v. Chief Constable of West Yorkshire (1989 A.C. 53), the mother of a victim of the Yorkshire Ripper instituted proceedings against the police alleging that they had failed properly to exercise their duty to exercise all reasonable care and skill to apprehend the perpetrator of various murders and to protect members of the public who might be his victims. Lord Keith in the House of Lords found that there was no sufficient foreseeability of harm to this victim, there being no general duty of care to protect all young females from a risk at large and that the imposition of liability was also excluded by strong policy reasons relating to the operational efficiency of the police. Exceptions to this approach arose in later cases (e.g. Swinney and another v. the Chief Constable of Northumbria [1997] Q.B. 464). In X and Others v. Bedfordshire County Council ([1995] 3 AER 353), the House of Lords held that local authorities could not be sued for negligence or for breach of statutory duty in respect of the discharge of their functions concerning the welfare of children. In subsequent cases, it was not excluded that in certain circumstances a duty of care might arise (see e.g. Barrett v. the London Borough of Enfield [1999] 3 WLR 79).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
86,001-78661,ENG,GBR,ADMISSIBILITY,2006,WALSH v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,4,Inadmissible,Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant is an Irish citizen born in 1966 and currently serving a prison sentence in HM Prison Maghaberry, Lisburn, Northern Ireland. He is represented by Mr P. Pierce, a solicitor practising in Belfast. The applicant has an extensive criminal record, commencing in February 1980. This record includes some 132 road traffic offences, one offence of conspiracy to rob, four of burglary, eight of theft and 14 of going equipped for theft, together with other miscellaneous convictions. On 13 June 2003, the applicant, with other co-defendants, was acquitted of offences of obtaining services and property by deception. The restraint order imposed on the applicant’s property pending any eventual confiscation order on conviction was discharged. On 2 July 2003, the Assets Recovery Agency served a summons on the applicant for the purposes of recovery proceedings. The Agency sought recovery of the sum of GBP 70,250 allegedly paid to his solicitor in 2001 for buying a house and the sum of GBP 5,969.10 held in a bank account, alleging that these were the proceeds of unlawful conduct within the meaning of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (“POCA”). At an interlocutory hearing, it was contended on behalf of the applicant, that the proceedings for recovery of his assets were not “civil” but criminal in nature and that the guarantees of Articles 6 §§ 1 and 2 applied, in particular as regarded the standard of proof. On 1 April 2004, the High Court judge rejected the applicant’s claims on this interlocutory matter, considering, on examination of domestic and Strasbourg authority, that there was no criminal charge being determined in the recovery proceedings. On 26 June 2005, the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland rejected the applicant’s appeal. It found, applying the Engel criteria, that in domestic law the proceedings were classified as civil, not involving the preferring of a criminal charge in a criminal setting, or giving rise to any criminal record; that the purpose of the proceedings was not to make him amenable to punishment for a specific crime by way of imprisonment or a fine but that they were restitutionary in nature seeking the recovery of assets acquired through criminal conduct.. As to the nature of any penalty, while the recovery of assets could readily be described as a preventative measure, it considered that even if the proceedings did impose a penalty that this was not sufficient to classify the proceedings as criminal for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. It concluded, rejecting arguments that cumulatively the proceedings were criminal: “The essence of article 6 in the criminal dimension is the charging of a person with a criminal offence for the purpose of securing a conviction with a view to exposing that person to criminal sanction. These proceedings are obviously and significantly different from that type of application. They are not directed towards him in the sense that they seek to inflict punishment beyond the recovery of assets that do not lawfully belong to him. As such, while they will obviously have an impact on the appellant, these are predominantly proceedings in rem. They are designed to recover the proceeds of crime, rather than to establish, in the context of criminal proceedings, guilt of specific offences. The cumulative effect of the application of the tests in Engel is to identify these clearly as civil proceedings.” On 7 July 2005, the House of Lords refused leave to appeal. On 6 July 2006, in determining the application for a civil recovery order against the applicant for the sums, principally, of GBP 70,250 alleged to have been paid by the applicant in January 2001 for the purpose of purchasing property and of GBP 5,969.10 currently held in a bank account, the High Court judge took into account the applicant’s criminal convictions up until 2003 as showing a clear indication of his propensity to indulge in serious criminal conduct. He did not take into account the offences for which the applicant was acquitted as he had not had the opportunity of assessing the quality of the evidence of the one identifying witness, and while he noted that no prosecution was brought following the arrest of the applicant and E. on suspicion of robbery, he did take into account that the applicant had been found, on the day of the robbery, in company with E. who was carrying marked bank notes as confirming his criminal associations, as did evidence from police officers as concerns his associations with other persons with criminal records. The judge went on to to find that the applicant had not accounted for his assets. There had been no evidence to support his alleged car dealing and no record with the Inland Revenue that he had been in employment. Only small sums, from alleged employment with a cleaning business (which earnings dubiously overlapped with a period in prison) and from state benefits were accounted for. He concluded that he was satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the applicant had for some time pursued a criminal lifestyle involving dishonest and acquisitive criminal conduct with a willingness to resort to violence if necessary. His criminal record and in particular his conviction for conspiracy to rob, his association with criminals with a similar background of offences together with the circumstances in which he had most recently been arrested served to convince him that crime had been his primary means of acquiring funds for a number of years. In the circumstances he was satisfied that the sums that the Agency sought to recover represented property obtained through unlawful conduct and he accordingly made a recovery order for the sums set out in the application. According to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, application may be made to the High Court for the civil recovery of property representing the proceeds of “unlawful conduct” By virtue of section 241(1) unlawful conduct is defined as: “Conduct occurring in any part of the United Kingdom is unlawful conduct if it is unlawful under the criminal law of that part.” Section 241(3) provides that the standard of proof of unlawful conduct is that of the balance of probabilities.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
87,001-23355,ENG,SWE,ADMISSIBILITY,2003,PITKÄNEN v. SWEDEN,4,Inadmissible,Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant, Mr Pentti Pitkänen, is a Swedish national, who was born in 1934 and lives in Haninge. He is represented before the Court by Mr W. Pietikäinen, who lives in Johanneshov. The respondent Government are represented by their Agent Mrs Inger Kalmerborn, Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant worked as a refrigerator erector for many years. In October 1992 while welding he was exposed to phosgene as a result of a Freon leakage. Two weeks later he caught pneumonia. Having recovered therefrom, as from mid-November 1992 he suffered from headache, dizziness, fatigue and hypersensitivity in his left hand. On 23 June 1993 claiming that he had been exposed to an on-the-job injury the applicant requested that the Social Insurance Office in Stockholm (Försäkringskassan, Stockholms Län) pay him compensation and a life annuity (ersättning och livränta). The applicant’s medical records, a medical opinion of 28 May 1993 by a doctor at a clinic specialising in occupational medicine, and a statement of 16 October 1996 by the doctor attached to the Social Insurance Office in order to assist with medical matters, were submitted. Both doctors stated that a causal connection between the Freon leakage incident and the symptoms that the applicant later experienced was improbable. It appears that the applicant and his counsel attended a consultation with the Social Insurance Office. On 14 January 1997 the Social Insurance Office found against the applicant. On appeal to the County Administrative Court in Stockholm (Länsrätten i Stockholm), the applicant, represented by counsel, requested that an oral hearing be held and that a witness on his behalf, a former refrigerator erector, be heard. He did not specify which issues he wanted to hear the witness about, except the fact “refrigerator erectors do not live long”. By decision of 31 January 1997 the court refused to hold an oral hearing since on the material before it such was found clearly unnecessary. The court indicated that the invoked witness could not contribute to the elucidation of the question whether there was a causal link between the applicant’s exposure to phosgene and his health problems, and held that the available written evidence was sufficient for a proper assessment of the applicant’s case. The applicant was given an opportunity to submit his final observation in the case no later than 3 March 1997. On 6 February 1997 the applicant submitted his final observations, which included a fresh request that the witness be heard at an oral hearing in that “the best knowledge of industrial injuries comes from the workplace”. His request was refused on 19 February 1997 by the court, which on the same date delivered its judgment confirming the Social Insurance Office’s decision in the light of the material submitted i.e. the evidence which had also been submitted before the Social Insurance Office. Like the Social Insurance Office, the court did not question that the applicant had been exposed to phosgene, but found that no causal link existed between the exposure and the applicant’s medical problems. The applicant requested leave to appeal and an oral hearing in the leaveto-appeal proceedings, including an examination of his witness. By decision of 27 May 1998 the Administrative Court of Appeal (Kammarrätten i Stockholm) stated as follows: ”The proceedings before the Administrative Court of Appeal are written. According to Section 9 of the Administrative Court Procedure Act (förvaltningsprocesslagen) the proceedings may include an oral hearing with regard to a particular issue when there is reason to assume that holding a hearing would be to the advantage of the proceedings or further the speedy determination of the case. An oral hearing shall take place at the request of an individual party to the case if such a hearing is necessary and there are no particular reasons against holding a hearing. Having regard to the nature of the case and the evidence submitted, the Administrative Court of Appeal finds that an oral hearing and a hearing of the witness is unnecessary, and thus refuses the [applicant’s] request...” The applicant was given an opportunity to conclude his claim in writing and by decision of 28 January 1999 the Administrative Court of Appeal refused the applicant’s request for leave to appeal. On 18 February 1999 the applicant submitted his request for leave to appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court (Regeringsrätten) before which he reiterated his request for an oral hearing and an examination of his witness. On 19 April 1999 the Supreme Administrative Court informed the applicant that oral hearings are not normally hold before it. Furthermore, the court invited the applicant to submit his final observations in the case within three weeks. By decision of 22 July 1999 the Supreme Administrative Court refused the applicant’s request for leave to appeal. All gainfully employed persons working in Sweden are insured against industrial injuries in accordance with the Act on Industrial Injury Insurance (lagen om arbetsskadeförsäkring, 1976:380; hereinafter “the 1976 Act”). The term industrial injury refers mainly to injuries that result from accidents or other harmful effects at a person’s place of work. Pursuant to chapter 8, section 1 of the 1976 Act, an industrial injury shall immediately be reported to the employer, who shall report it to the Social Insurance Office. The office shall obtain a medical opinion concerning the injury. A physician shall be attached to the office in order to assist it in medical matters (the insurance doctor). The assessment of whether an injury qualifies as an industrial injury, as well as the degree of reduction of a person’s ability to engage in gainful employment, shall be made on the basis of the available medical opinions, the insurance doctor’s assessment of those opinions and any other information pertaining to the matter. For an injury to be qualified as an industrial injury a causal link must be established between the accident or the harmful effect in the workplace and the insured persons’ health problems. At the relevant time, the question of whether a particular injury or illness incurred by the insured was to be regarded as an industrial injury was subject to a rule of evidence relieving the insured person of the burden of proof. If it was clear that the insured person had suffered an accident or had been subjected to some other harmful effect at work, his or her medical problems were presumed to have been caused by the accident or the harmful effect unless there were much stronger grounds for a conclusion to the contrary (chapter 2, section 2 of the 1976 Act in its wording before 1 January 1993, which applied to injuries having occurred before that date and which had been reported to the Social Insurance Office by 30 June 1993 at the latest). The procedure in the administrative courts is governed by the provisions of the Administrative Court Procedure Act (förvaltningsprocesslagen, lag 1971:291 - hereinafter “the 1971 Act”). Section 9 provides: “The proceedings are in writing. An oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue, when there is reason to assume that that would be to the benefit of the proceedings or the speedy determination of the case. In the Administrative Court of Appeal and the County Administrative Court an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings, unless it is unnecessary or there are particular reasons against holding a hearing.” The possibility for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request under those circumstances is not available in the proceedings before the Supreme Administrative Court. According to the preparatory documents to the 1971 Act, an oral hearing can be a valuable complement to the written proceedings and may benefit the examination of a case in two situations in particular: firstly, when it is necessary to hear a witness, an expert or a party or when it is difficult for a party to present the case in writing and, secondly, when different positions in the case need to be sorted out in order to eliminate unnecessary or pointless issues of dispute. In the latter case, the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character. It was stressed, however, that an oral hearing should not be seen as an alternative to the written procedure but as a complement to it (see Government Bill 1971:30, p. 535). It was further stated, in respect of the third paragraph of section 9, that a party’s request for an oral hearing should be given great consideration. However, such a request should not have a decisive influence on the matter, as the question whether an oral hearing is necessary is to be determined primarily on the basis of the available information in the case. Still, other circumstances may be of relevance, for instance the importance for the party of the matter at stake or the possibility that an oral hearing could enhance the party’s understanding of a future decision in the case. Nevertheless, if the case is of a trivial character or the costs of an oral hearing would be disproportionate to the values at stake in the case, there could be reason not to hold an oral hearing (p. 537).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
88,001-23836,ENG,DEU,ADMISSIBILITY,2003,REUTHER v. GERMANY,1,Inadmissible,,"The applicant, Mr Hugo Reuther, is a German national, who was born in 1939 and lives in Presseck (Germany). He was represented before the Court by Mr K.D. Deumeland. On 7 December 1999 the Kulmbach District Court made a sentence order (Strafbefehl) against the applicant. In a decision of 19 June 2000, after the prosecution had revoked the sentence order, the District Court ruled that the costs necessarily incurred by the applicant were to be paid by the State. On 4 July 2000 the applicant’s representative, who also represented him before the Court, sought reimbursement of 1,916.32 German marks (DEM – approximately 950 euros (EUR)). On 23 August 2000 the District Court dismissed the representative’s claim for failure to comply with Article 138 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below) on the ground that he was not a lawyer admitted to practise at a German court and had not been authorised by the court to represent the applicant. The costs in question had therefore not been necessarily incurred within the meaning of Article 464 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Furthermore, the applicant had merely claimed a lump sum, which could not be refunded. On 5 September 2000 the Bayreuth Regional Court upheld the lower court’s decision. It added that the applicant’s representative could not be regarded as a professor or lecturer in law (Rechtslehrer) within the meaning of Article 138 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below), since that provision did not apply to non-tenured lecturers (Lehrbeauftragte) at a higher-education establishment. On 16 September 2000 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal with the Bavarian Constitutional Court (Bayerischer Verfassungsgerichtshof) against the decisions in issue. In a letter of 26 September 2000 the legal secretary (Rechtsreferentin) of the Bavarian Constitutional Court acknowledged receipt of the applicant’s appeal and asked his representative, among other things, to state whether he was a lawyer admitted to practise or a professor or lecturer in law at a university (Hochschule). In a letter of 8 November 2000 the legal secretary informed the applicant of a number of obstacles that might prevent the appeal from being declared admissible and well-founded. She concluded that, for the reasons stated, the appeal appeared to be partly inadmissible and partly manifestly ill-founded (offensichtlich unbegründet). In such cases, the Constitutional Court could order appellants to pay a certain sum (a maximum of DEM 3,000 – approximately EUR 1,500) before it continued its examination of the appeal, the aim being to avoid unnecessary expense for those concerned. The legal secretary gave the applicant one month to reply, failing which the case would be deemed to have been settled. The applicant replied on 4 December 2000. In a decision of 15 January 2001 the Bavarian Constitutional Court, sitting as a panel of three judges, ordered the applicant to pay DEM 1,500 by way of an advance for costs (Kostenvorschuss). The decision was accompanied by a short letter from the legal secretary explaining, in particular, that it had been taken pursuant to section 27(1) of the Bavarian Constitutional Court Act and that the appeal was therefore regarded as inadmissible or manifestly ill-founded. In a letter of 23 January 2001 the applicant contended that the decision should have contained a statement of reasons. On 30 January 2001 the legal secretary replied that decisions on orders for costs did not require a statement of reasons. She drew attention to her letter of 8 November 2000 and sent him a copy of the entire file so that he could consult it as he had requested. The applicant did not pay the sum demanded. Article 138 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordnung) provides that defendants may choose as their counsel any lawyer admitted to practise at a German court or a professor or lecturer in law (Rechtslehrer) at a German university (Hochschule). Article 138 § 2 provides, inter alia, that other persons may be authorised to act as counsel by the court dealing with the case. In practice, neither professors or lecturers in law at a university of applied sciences (Fachhochschule) nor non-tenured lecturers (Lehrbeauftragte) at a higher-education establishment are regarded as “professors or lecturers in law” within the meaning of this provision. In two recent decisions of 5 May 1999 (no. 1 Ws 121/99) and 3 May 2000 (no. 1 Ws 94/00) the Jena and Dresden Courts of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht) held respectively that a professor of law attached to a university of applied sciences and a non-tenured law lecturer were entitled to be regarded as professors or lecturers within the meaning of Article 138 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Section 11 of the Bavarian Constitutional Court Act (Gesetz über den Bayerischen Verfassungsgerichtshof) of 10 May 1990 provides that the President appoints a secretary-general from among the court’s professional judges. The secretary-general’s role is to assist the President in carrying out his duties and with administrative tasks. Section 12(1) provides that when the Constitutional Court is not in session, its powers are assumed by the President or are delegated by him to the secretary-general. The secretary-general may, for example, be instructed to take the necessary procedural steps for the preparation of sessions and to carry out administrative duties. Section 12(3) provides, inter alia, that the President appoints a person to represent the secretary-general in discharging non-judicial duties. In practice, this person is known as the legal secretary (Referent) of the Bavarian Constitutional Court.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
89,001-67416,ENG,SWE,ADMISSIBILITY,2004,B. v. SWEDEN,4,Inadmissible,Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant is a Libyan national who was born in 1968. He was represented before the Court by Mr N. Odén, a lawyer practising in Gothenburg. The respondent Government were represented by Ms I. Kalmerborn, Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant arrived in Sweden on 13 May 2001 and applied for asylum on 28 May 2001. An initial interview with the applicant was conducted by the Migration Board (Migrationsverket) on 30 May 2001. At that interview the applicant stated, inter alia, that he had travelled to Sweden with a false passport which he had obtained through a friend of his father's who worked at the Libyan passport authority. As agreed with that person, he had sent back the false passport after having entered Sweden. His own genuine passport remained in Libya with his parents. Asked about his professional background, the applicant responded that he was an architect by profession and had been employed by the state for seven years at “the People's Committee for the educational sector in the district of al-Zawiyah”. However, he had stopped working in mid-January 2001. The applicant stated that disturbances had erupted in al-Zawiyah at the end of the year 2000. He had openly participated in the protests against the presence of (sub-Saharan) Africans in the country, mainly by distributing leaflets. In January 2001 he had been arrested by the security office in al-Zawiyah and accused of participating in the uprising against the Africans. On this occasion he had been questioned and held in detention for four days. Following the interview, the record of it was read out to the applicant who declared that it was correct and that he had understood the interpreter well. A second interview was held by the Migration Board on 21 March 2002. On this occasion the applicant was heard, inter alia, about the contents of three documents which he had received from Libya after his arrival in Sweden and submitted to the Board on 6 August 2001: (1) a birth certificate, (2) an international driver's licence issued in Libya on 15 May 2001 after he had left for Sweden, and (3) a document showing that he had completed his national military service. Asked about his passport, the applicant stated that it was impossible for him to obtain it as it was held by the security service which had taken it at the end of October 2000 “for reasons identical to his grounds for seeking asylum”. Describing his activities during the disturbances in his hometown, the applicant stated that he had participated by writing and distributing leaflets, encouraging people to force the Government to resign. In the leaflets, he had mentioned that, since coming to power in 1969, Mu'ammar Al-Qadhafi had treated the applicant's clan harshly. The clan had been politically influential before 1969. The uprising had lasted for 2-3 weeks in September 2000 and most of those living in al-Zawiyah had taken part. The security services had been sent to al-Zawiyah to deal with the problem. They had first targeted the applicant's clan. They had had no information regarding the names of the persons who had participated but had acted arbitrarily and arrested a large number of young men. In October 2000 the applicant had been arrested by the security service at his work place and held in detention for four days awaiting a hearing concerning his detention. On the fourth day the persons in charge of his interrogation had released him pending further questioning. Upon his release, the applicant had gone to Sabrata, a small town west of al-Zawiyah, where he had stayed in hiding with a friend for six to eight months before leaving for Sweden. Throughout this period he had been searched for by the security service. Asked about what would happen to him if returned to Libya, the applicant first stated that it was difficult to say exactly but that he would consider himself fortunate if he were given life imprisonment. Slightly later during the interview, however, he stated that the media had reported that death sentences had been handed down against the leaders of the revolt and that his own name had been among those that had been mentioned. He also asserted that a friend in Libya had informed him that he had been sentenced to death in absentia. According to the applicant, this type of judgment was not issued by a court but by a kind of popular conference entitled Al-Moétamarat Al-Shaébia. No appeal lay against it. The applicant further stated that it was possible that news about his sentence could have been published in either of two named government-controlled Libyan newspapers. The applicant declared that he had understood the interpreter well. The record of the second interview further stated that it had been read out to the applicant who had approved it. In written observations submitted to the Migration Board on 16 April 2002, the applicant's counsel, who had not been present at the interviews, stated that the record of the second interview had not been read out to the applicant or approved by him. Counsel further mentioned that, while in hiding in Sabrata, the applicant had been unable to communicate with his parents by telephone. Instead, the friend who had been hiding him had visited the parents a couple of times and had then received information and the applicant's allegedly false passport. The Migration Board noted that in March 2001 the Swedish General Consulate in Tripoli had received an application for an entry visa in the applicant's name, which contained a copy of a passport in the same name. The application had been rejected. On 5 August 2002, in reply to this information, the applicant's counsel noted that the copy of the passport was a copy of the same, allegedly false, passport the applicant had used to enter Sweden. The name, address and place of birth were correct in the application. The applicant had not made the visa application himself and therefore assumed that it must have been made by the head of the passport authority, who was the person who had issued the false passport and had made the arrangements for the applicant's journey to Sweden. The applicant was now in a position to name this person, as he had, for unknown reasons, left his position at the passport authority. Counsel further stated that the applicant's brother had sought to obtain a copy of the newspaper in which the applicant's death sentence had been reported but the brother's motives had been questioned and he had failed to obtained the copy due to fear. On 25 October 2002 the Migration Board rejected the applicant's request for asylum and ordered that he should be expelled from Sweden. It considered it remarkable that the applicant had been able to leave detention unconditionally, without for example any obligation to report or to put up bail. Moreover, it found that the fact that the applicant had remained in the country for several months after his release indicated that he did not perceive his need for protection as pressing. It also found it remarkable that he had been able to leave the country with a passport that he had acknowledged contained correct personal data, especially since he alleged that the Libyan authorities were searching for him. Against this background, the Migration Board found that the applicant's involvement in the riots as well as the possible consequences thereof were exaggerated. On 29 November 2002 the applicant appealed to the Aliens Appeals Board (Utlänningsnämnden). On 9 January 2003 he submitted what he stated was a copy of a document which his brother had been able to obtain “via an acquaintance with contacts in the congress”. The document had been sent to an acquaintance in England who, in turn, had sent it to the applicant by fax. Issued by the People's Committee in al-Zawiyah on 28 May 2001, it called for the search and arrest by the security service of four named persons, including the applicant. It stated that a decision had been taken that the four persons should be executed on account of acts committed against the security of the state. While the applicant did not at this stage specifically claim that this document was a “judgment” issued by the People's Committee, he asserted that it unambiguously demonstrated that he had been sentenced to death in Libya and was being sought for execution of the judgment. On 29 April 2003 the Aliens Appeals Board rejected the applicant's appeal. It noted that there had been violent riots in September 2000 resulting in the death of many of its participants. Most of the people accused of involvement in the riots had been sentenced to death. It considered that the applicant had not shown that he would risk the death penalty upon return to Libya. If he had been of interest to the Libyan authorities he would not have been able to leave the country the way he claimed. Even having regard to the alleged copy of the judgment, the Aliens Appeals Board found reasons to question that he was of any particular interest to Libyan authorities. He had, thus, not shown that he was in need of protection. In June 2003 the applicant filed a new application for a residence permit with the Aliens Appeals Board, arguing that the previous decisions had been based on misunderstandings, misinterpretations and mistrust. He provided further details regarding the circumstances surrounding his arrest and subsequent escape from Libya. He thus stated, inter alia, that he had been one in a group of seven persons who had cooperated in writing and distributing leaflets in order to demonstrate their discontent with the regime. However, the security services had begun a campaign of arrests, torture and detentions without trial. One in their group had been arrested and, before being executed, had been forced under torture to reveal the identity of the others. When learning of the arrest the other members of the group had tried to hide or escape, but the applicant and two others had been arrested. He had been held in detention for four days at a local police station but had eventually been able to bribe a police officer to let him escape. He had paid the officer the equivalent of 3000 US dollars and had handed over his genuine passport. He had thereafter hid in another town for seven months. By bribing the head of the passport authority his family had been able to obtain a false passport for him. This passport was in fact a “real” and new passport but it was not “registered with the passport authority” and did not contain a bar code used for computer control or his “real name”. The passport also erroneously stated that he was married. The same person had arranged all other details regarding his journey, including his application for a visa and his ticket. The applicant further stated that during the time when he was in hiding in Libya the authorities had sent summonses for his appearance to his home, to the office where he worked and to the engineers' labour union of which he was a member. When this had not succeeded the authorities had tried to put pressure on his family. His father had been arrested and detained for three days, like his brothers who had been tortured to disclose his whereabouts. To avoid exposing his relatives to further torture, he had decided to escape abroad. However, after his arrival in Sweden his youngest brother had been imprisoned and had informed the authorities that the applicant was living in Sweden. The applicant also stated that he had stayed in Libya for several months before leaving as the journey had required careful preparation. After a period of time in Sweden the applicant had learned that he and three others in his group had been sentenced to death and that orders had been issued to all police units to arrest and execute them. Several attempts had been made to obtain this judgment. His brothers had finally managed to get in touch with “someone who has the key to the cupboard where the judgments are kept”. By bribing this person with 1000 dinars they had managed to obtain a copy of the judgment. The applicant claimed that two of the persons in his group had been granted asylum in the United Kingdom and in Canada. In support of his new application the applicant submitted what he claimed were copies of three summonses for him to appear for questioning issued by the Libyan authorities in October and November 2000 and May 2001, respectively. On 4 September 2003 the Aliens Appeals Board rejected the new application stating that it contained no new circumstances which would give reasons to change its previous assessment. The new documents, which were copies, were not of such a character as to influence the assessment of the applicant's need for protection. The immigration authorities have contacted the Libyan Embassy in Stockholm in order to obtain travel documents for the purpose of enforcing the expulsion order against the applicant. By a decision of 21 October 2003, following the Court's indication under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, the Migration Board stayed the enforcement of the applicant's expulsion until further notice. On 19 November 2003 the applicant submitted to the Court copies of documents purportedly issued by Libyan authorities. One document, dated 3 June 2001, is a communication from “the Secretary to the People's Committee of the Congress” in old Zawia to “the Secretary to the People's Committee for Justice and General Security”, in which the latter is requested to agree to the notification of all airports, seaports and border-controls to prevent five named individuals, among them the applicant and a Mr Hasan Ahmed El Amouri, from leaving Libya. Another document, dated 18 June 2001, is a communication from the first-mentioned official to “the Secretary to the Office for Communications Abroad”, informing the recipient that four individuals mentioned in the first document, including the applicant but not Mr El Amouri, had fled the country and calling for their capture and return to Libya by the external security organs. A third document records a decision of 27 May 2001 to detain the applicant's younger brother for failure to disclose the applicant's whereabouts. Another document contains a summons for the applicant's father to appear on 20 June 2001 for questioning in relation to the applicant's escape from Libya.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
90,001-5238,ENG,CYP,ADMISSIBILITY,2000,UNION NATIONALE (TOURISM AND SEA RESORTS) LTD and OTHERS v. CYPRUS,4,Inadmissible,,"The applicants are thirty-three enterprises and individuals who are the owners and operators of hotel units and hotel apartments in Limassol.

Estates Ltd, Old Bridge Hotel Apartments Ltd and Best Leisure Hotels Ltd. They are represented before the Court by Mr M. A. Triantafyllides, Mr G. P. Kakoyiannis and Mr P. Pavlou, lawyers practising in Nicosia. s, may be summarised as follows. Under the Limassol-Amathounta Sewage Regulations 99/91 of 1991 and Appendix I thereto, based on Article 49 of the Sewage System Law 1/71 of 1971, hotels and hotel apartments were charged with sewerage fees at the rate of 7/100 of a cent for every pound of the assessed value of each building, whereas all other buildings in the same area were charged with fees at the rate of only 1,8/100 of a cent for every pound of the assessed value. Thirty-nine owners of hotels in Limassol, including the applicants, lodged an application with the Supreme Court, sitting at first instance, seeking a ruling that Regulations 99/91, and in particular Rule 32, as well as the decision of the Board of the Sewage System of Limassol-Amathounta (SALA) rendering the applicants liable to pay their contribution for 1991, were unconstitutional, illegal and invalid. The applicants argued that SALA acted ultra vires because Rules 32 and 33 and Appendix I fell outside the scope of Law 1/71. By a judgment of 20 December 1991, the Supreme Court rejected the application considering that the above matter was a regulation and not an administrative decision concerning specific individuals, and thus could not be subject to judicial review according to Article 146 of the Constitution. The applicants appealed to the Supreme Court, sitting as an appeal court, which on 29 March 1996 quashed the judgment of 20 December 1991. The Supreme Court considered that Appendix I to Regulations 99/91 constituted an executory administrative act which could be challenged under Article 146 of the Constitution. On 17 January 1997 the Supreme Court, ruling on the merits of the case, considered that the applicants’ submission that Article 30 of Law 1/71 was limited to contributions of a repayment character was unfounded. The court referred to a previous judgment (Loizou v. the Board of the Sewage System of Nicosia) in which it had held that “the rates in this case were plainly a tax. They constituted a compulsory exaction of money by a public authority for public purposes, enforceable by Law and were not a payment for services rendered”. Article 30 did not link the power to levy a charge with the immediate availability of sewage services but expressly extended this levy to owners or occupants of immovable property which would benefit in the future from such services. Thus by levying a charge, after the initiation of works for a sewage system but before its completion, SALA had not acted ultra vires. The distinction made by the Rules between owners of hotels and hotel apartments, on the one hand, and owners of apartments in ordinary blocks of flats on the other was triggered by Article 30 of the Law 1/71, which permitted the imposition of different fees according to the nature of the property. This difference had been acknowledged in the case of Philippa Estates Ltd and Others v. SALA. The Supreme Court had then held that such a distinction was not only legally justified but also fair, having regard to the use and the benefits derived from the sewage system. Moreover, the number of tenants per square meter in hotel accommodation was, in comparison with other immovable property, much higher and, in proportion, the use of the sewage system was more extensive. The case of Phillipa Estates Ltd and Others had been brought by certain hotel owners (including some of the applicants) who claimed that the decision on their liability to pay sewage charges for 1992 was unconstitutional. SALA had sent them notification of the charge and the hotel owners had refused to pay. They claimed that as SALA had not determined the fee due for 1992, it could not expect payment. Further, some parts of Law 1/71 were unconstitutional because they conflicted with Article 28 of the Constitution which provides for non-discrimination.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
91,001-4656,ENG,RUS,ADMISSIBILITY,1999,TUMILOVICH v. RUSSIA,3,Inadmissible,Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant is a Russian national, born in 1948 and living in Krasnodar. A. The applicant worked as an engineer for the joint-stock company “Saturn” (АООТ «САТУРН») (“the company”). Because of the financial difficulties of the company the applicant was ordered to take unpaid leave for the period from 12 October 1993 to 1 November 1995. It appears that the applicant decided to take further unpaid leave until December 1996.  In 1996, while on leave, the applicant brought an action for damages against the company requesting compensation for losses she had incurred and reinstatement in her former job. On 13 December 1996 the Prikubansk District Court (Прикубанский районный суд) refused to deal with the applicant’s action on the grounds that she had failed to comply with the procedural requirements. On 11 February 1997 the same court, after a public hearing, dismissed the applicant’s rectified action finding, inter alia, that the company’s financial difficulties had an objective basis which was beyond the court’s control. On 25 March 1997 the Krasnodarsk Regional Court (Краснодарский краевой суд), upon the applicant's appeal, upheld the judgment of the Prikubansk District Court. On 8 April 1997, the applicant was dismissed from work following a reorganisation of the company.  The applicant lodged several complaints with various State administrative authorities. On 25 December 1996 and 19 May 1998 she was informed by the Regional Work Inspectorate (Государственная инспекция труда по Краснодарскому Краю) and the Federal Work Inspectorate (Федеральная инспекция труда) respectively that labour disputes fell within the competence of the national courts.  By letter of 17 June 1997 the Deputy Krasnodarsk Regional Prosecutor (заместитель прокурора Краснодарского края) rejected the applicant’s application to file an appeal for a supervisory review (hereafter referred to as an “application for a supervisory review”) (жалоба в порядке надзора) against the ordinary courts’ judgments, finding that the issues raised by the applicant had been properly dealt with by the national courts. The applicant lodged another application for supervisory review with the Krasnodarsk Regional Court requesting that the ordinary courts’ judgments be quashed and her case reconsidered. By letter of 5 August 1997 the Deputy President of the Krasnodarsk Regional Court informed the applicant that her application had been rejected for being unsubstantiated, as confirmed by letter of 3 December 1997 from the President of the Regional Court. By letter of 6 August 1997 the Krasnodarsk Regional Prosecutor (Прокурoр Краснодарского края) rejected the applicant’s third application for a supervisory review. By letters of 8 August 1997 and 19 February 1998 the Prosecutor General Office (Генеральная прокуратура) dismissed the applicant’s fourth application for a supervisory review against the ordinary courts’ judgments.  By letter of 15 June 1998 the President of the Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court (Председатель состава Судебной коллегии по гражанским делам Верховного Суда) rejected the applicant’s fifth application for a supervisory review as unsubstantiated. By letter of 14 October 1998 the Deputy Prosecutor General (Заместитель Генерального Прокурoра) rejected the applicant’s sixth and last application for a supervisory review.  By letter of 15 February 1999 the Constitutional Court (Конституционный Суд) informed the applicant that it was not competent to deal with her complaint. B. Relevant domestic law According to Article 319 of the Code of Civil Procedure (“the Code”), judgments, court rulings and decrees which have entered into force, may be reviewed by way of supervision following a “protest” (протест) lodged by the persons listed in Article 320 of the Code. According to Article 320 of the Code, the persons competent to lodge a protest are the Prosecutor General and the President of the Supreme Court.  According to Article 322 of the Code, the persons listed in Article 320 are entitled, subject to certain conditions, to obtain the case file in a civil case in order to establish whether there are any grounds for lodging a protest by way of supervision.

92,001-96757,ENG,DEU,ADMISSIBILITY,2009,HENNE v. GERMANY,4,Inadmissible,Isabelle Berro-Lefèvre;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"The applicant, Ms Christa Henne, is a German national and lives in Köln. She was represented before the Court by Mr T. Purps, a lawyer practising in Potsdam. In 1992 the applicant inherited a 2,490 square-metre plot of land in Neugattersleben on the territory of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) (“the property”) and was registered in the land register as owner of the property. Some 400 square meters of the property had been used, at least since 1979 or 1980, as a road and were recorded as such in the registers of public roads in 1984 and 1989. The applicant disputed that the relevant authorities of the GDR had designated the property as a public road as required by the laws of the GDR. On 5 December 2003, and amended on 28 July 2005, the municipality made a written offer to the applicant, certified by a notary public, to buy the property for 8,964 euros pursuant to the Act on the Allocation of Legal Positions on Traffic Space and Other Publicly Used Private Property – “the Traffic Space Allocation Act” (Gesetz zur Bereinigung der Rechtsverhältnisse an Verkehrsflächen und anderen öffentlich genutzten privaten Grundstücken/ Verkehrsflächenbereinigungsgesetz) (see “Relevant domestic law” below). The applicant declined the offer. On 9 September 2005 the Dessau Regional Court ordered the applicant to accept the offer. The Regional Court held that the property was “traffic space” within the meaning of Section 1(1) No. 1 of the Traffic Space Allocation Act (see “Relevant domestic law” below); that the municipality had proved that the relevant authorities of the GDR had considered the road as a public road prior to 1984 and that it was therefore “traffic space” within the meaning of Section 2(2) No. 1 of that Act (see “Relevant domestic law” below), since the laws of the GDR did not necessarily require the proper designation of property as a public road; that all other requirements for the sale as required by the Traffic Space Allocation Act had been met; and that the calculation of the purchase price was in accordance with the statutory requirements. On 5 May 2006 the Naumburg Court of Appeal informed counsel for the applicant of its intention to dismiss the applicant’s appeal as manifestly ill-founded because the Regional Court’s judgment, in particular concerning the qualification of the property as “traffic space”, had been free of error. On 13 June 2006 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It held that it could not consider the applicant’s claim that only part of the property was used as a road whereas the whole property was to be taken on the following grounds: the municipality had stated before the Regional Court that it had made an offer for the whole property because the remainder of the property could not be sufficiently used; the applicant had not disputed this assertion in the proceedings before the Regional Court; his new submission that the taking of the whole property would be contrary to Sections 4(1) No. 2 and 4(2) of the Traffic Space Allocation Act (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below) was procedurally barred pursuant to Section 531(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below). On 26 March 2007 the Federal Constitutional Court refused to admit the applicant’s constitutional complaint for adjudication without giving further reasons (no. 1 BvR 2119/06). In the GDR private property was often used for public purposes without the property being transferred into public ownership. Following German reunification the public use of private property was initially allowed to continue without any revision until 30 September 2001 and the owners of such property were, under certain conditions, entitled to rent from the public authority pursuant to Section 233(2a)(9) of the Introductory Act to the Civil Code (Einführungsgesetz zum Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuche). Under the Property Law Reform Act (Sachenrechtsbereinigungsgesetz), owners were in principle entitled to 50 % of the value of the land as compensation for the loss of the land (Section 68(1) of the Property Law Reform Act, is, as far as relevant here, inapplicable in cases concerning the use of private property for public purposes (Section 2(1) No. 4 of the Property Law Reform Act)). With effect from 1 October 2001 the continued use of private property on the territory of the former GDR is governed by the Traffic Space Allocation Act. That Act is, inter alia, applicable if private property that was used as a public road by the authorities of the GDR continues to be used as a public road (Section 1(1) of the Traffic Space Allocation Act). “Traffic space” is defined as roads, alleys and squares that are either designated as public roads or treated as if they were by law (Section 2(2) No. 1 of that Act). The public authority using private property for a public road may request that the property be sold to it by making a written offer, certified by a notary public (Section 3(1) of that Act). The public authority may only request the sale of the property directly used for a public road (Section 4(1) No. 2 of that Act); it has to purchase the remainder the property only if it cannot be sufficiently used (Section 4(2) of that Act). The purchase price is 20 % of the value of the land (Section 5 of that Act). Until 30 June 2007 only the public authority could request the sale; since that date, only the private owner can do so (Section 8(1) of that Act). Until the sale has been concluded, the owner can request that the public authority pay him 8 % of the statutory purchase price as annual rent and bear the public expenses of the property; the public authority has the right to continue using the property pending the transfer of ownership (Section 9(1) of that Act). If the sold property is no longer used as a public road, the former owner can request that the property be sold to him for a certain purchase price (Section 9(2) of that Act). The former owner can request the restitution of property irrespective of a public authority’s continuing use of it pursuant to the Traffic Space Allocation Act. The public authority continues to enjoy a right to use the property following the return of the property to the former owner (Federal Administrative Court, judgment of 14 April 2005, no. BVerwG 7 C 10.04). In cases in which the public authority’s right to use the private property derived from Section 9(1) of the Traffic Space Allocation Act, the right to use prior to that Act’s coming into force derived from Section 233(2a)(9) of the Introductory Act to the Civil Code (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of 18 January 2002, V ZR 104/01). The Federal Court of Justice held in a leading judgment of 20 June 2008 (no. V ZR 149/07) that the purchase price of 20 % of the value of the land pursuant to Section 5 of the Allocation of Traffic Space Act was constitutional on the grounds that the property had been used as a public road in the GDR and could not have been sold or used by the private owner prior to German reunification; that the value of the property was diminished by the public use; that the legislator had taken into account that not the owner but upon request the public authority had to bear expenses related to the property; and that the public authority’s right to use was considerably more limited than that of a user who acquired the property under the terms of the Property Law Reform Act: whereas the latter could stop using the property and nevertheless remain the owner, the public authority was bound to sell the property to the former owner for a certain purchase price on request once it had stopped using the property as “traffic space”. Furthermore the Federal Court of Justice held that the contested provisions of the Traffic Space Allocation Act did not violate the owner’s rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 read alone or in conjunction with Article 14. Although the sale amounted to a de facto expropriation within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, it had a basis in domestic law, was in the general interest and not disproportionate. In particular, the legislator had acted within the wide margin of appreciation to be accorded to him in the unique context of the German reunification. Pursuant to Section 529 of the Code of Civil Procedure the Court of Appeal shall base its decision on the facts established by the first instance court, unless there are concrete indications that raise doubts as to the correctness or completeness of the establishment of the relevant facts by the first instance court, and on new facts, as long as it is admissible to consider these. The Court of Appeal may not consider submissions that the trial court has correctly excluded (Section 531(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure). It may, as far as relevant here, admit new submissions on appeal only if the party did not introduce them at trial through no fault of its own (Section 532(2) No. 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
93,001-88930,ENG,RUS,CHAMBER,2008,CASE OF SALATKHANOVY v. RUSSIA,3,No violation of Article 38 - Examination of the case-{general} (Article 38 - Obligation to furnish all necessary facilities),Anatoly Kovler;Christos Rozakis;Dean Spielmann;Elisabeth Steiner;Khanlar Hajiyev;Sverre Erik Jebens,"6. The applicants were born in 1951 and 1938 respectively and live in the village of Dyshne-Vedeno, the Chechen Republic. 7. The applicants are husband and wife. The first applicant is a housewife and the second applicant is retired. They have nine children. In April 2000 their son Ayub Salatkhanov, born in 1984, was a student of the 9th grade at school. 8. On 17 April 2000 at about 1 p.m. Ayub Salatkhanov, with three of his friends, were walking along Lenina Street towards the village market. At the same time a convoy of Russian military vehicles was going down the street. The convoy included armoured personnel carriers (APCs), with soldiers sitting on the hulls. One of the servicemen raised his automatic rifle, took aim and shot at the applicants’ son. According to the applicants, it must have been a rifle fitted with a silencer because the other three boys did not hear the shot and did not understand where it had been aimed, until Ayub Salatkhanov, who took several more steps, fell on the ground in front of a house at 153 Lenina Street, where the head of the village administration lived. 9. Ayub Salatkhanov was bleeding from the mouth and the chest area. He was immediately put into a car to be taken to the district hospital, but died in the car on the way. He had been wounded in the heart. 10. At the relevant time there were a lot of passers-by in the street, who called the local police, the military commander’s office and the prosecutors office. Together they forced the convoy to stop and to go to the military commander’s office. There the servicemen of the Dyshne-Vedeno temporary district police station (VOVD) identified a warrant officer, Ch., who had allegedly shot at the boy. In the meantime he had climbed from the APC into the hull of a ZIL-130 military truck. According to the applicants, the servicemen of the VOVD searched the truck, and in a box containing canned meat found an AK 7.62 automatic rifle, with an ammunition magazine and a silencer. The rifle belonged to warrant officer Ch. 11. On 17 April 2000 the Vedeno District Prosecutor’s Office opened criminal investigation no. 14/36006 under Article 105 paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code into the murder of Ayub Salatkhanov. The applicants were informed accordingly by a letter of 27 April 2000, which also stated that “the person who committed the crime has been identified and detained” and that the case file would be transferred for further investigation to the military prosecutor of military unit no. 20102 based in Khankala (the main Russian military base in Chechnya). 12. On the same date an inspection of the crime scene and of the military vehicles was carried out and E., an eye-witness, was questioned. E. submitted that on 17 April 2000 he, together with Ayub Salatkhanov, S., A., Kh. and B. had been walking down Lenina Street and that a military convoy had been moving towards them. He had seen a serviceman in an APC who lifted a weapon fitted with a silencer, aimed it at Ayub Salatkhanov from a distance of ten meters and took two or three shots with it. 13. On 19 April 2000 S. was questioned. He made a statement similar to that of E. 14. On 19 and 20 April 2000 serviceman S-v. was questioned. He submitted that a magazine case with 25 cartridges of 7.62 mm calibre and a silencer had been found in Ch.’s backpack. 15. On 20 April 2000 the second applicant was granted victim status in the criminal proceedings. 16. On the same date the automatic rifle was seized from Ch. It was inspected together with other pieces of evidence. 17. On 21 April 2000 Ch. reported to the Vedeno District Prosecutor’s Office and admitted his guilt. He was questioned as a suspect on the same date. He was placed under the supervision of the commander of military unit no. 75143 as a measure of restraint. 18. Later Ch. retracted the statement he had made on 21 April 2000 and apparently submitted that the bullets had ricocheted. 19. On 3 May 2000 a forensic expert examination of the cartridges was completed. 20. On 3 June 2000, due to the lack of evidence required to bring charges, the investigating authorities suspended the investigation and lifted the measure of restraint in respect of Ch. 21. On 16 June 2000 the Prosecutor’s Office of the Chechen Republic replied to the applicants’ request for information that the criminal investigation into their son’s murder had been transferred to the military prosecutor’s office, which was responsible for investigating crimes committed by servicemen. It was also stated that all further questions should be referred to the military prosecutor’s office in Khankala. On transfer, the case was given the number 34/33/0179-00. 22. On 20 June 2000, upon completion of his secondment in Chechnya, Ch. arrived in the town of Pechora in the Pskov region according to the order of the commander of military unit no. 75143. 23. On 28 June 2000 the applicants were informed by a letter from the military prosecutor of military unit no. 20102 that on 2 June 2000 the criminal investigation in respect of warrant officers Ch. and S-v. of military unit no. 75143 had been discontinued under Article 5 paragraph 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure [absence of corpus delicti]. The case file was forwarded for further investigation to the Prosecutor’s Office of the Chechen Republic. 24. On 29 June 2000 the supervising military prosecutor quashed the decision to suspend the investigation. 25. On 3 July 2000 the Vedeno district civil registration office issued a death certificate for Ayub Salatkhanov, aged 16, who had died on 17 April 2000 from a gunshot wound to the heart. 26. On 21 July and 26 October 2000 serviceman G. was questioned. He submitted that upon his arrival at the crime scene his comrade had told him that he had seen a serviceman climbing from the APC to the ZIL truck in front of it. When G. had approached the truck, he had seen a serviceman hiding in the corner. 27. On 22 July 2000 the second applicant and A. were questioned. A. made a statement similar to that of E. 28. On 23 July 2000 another inspection of the crime scene was carried out and E. was again questioned. T. was questioned on the same date and submitted that a spent yellow cartridge case had been found at the crime scene. It had been handed over to police officers. On the same date an investigative experiment was conducted. 29. On 24 July 2000 Yu. was questioned. He submitted that after the convoy had stopped he had seen a serviceman hiding inside a car. The serviceman had a red face, blue eyes and was of medium height. 30. T-v., apparently of the Vedeno District military commander’s office, who was questioned on the same date, stated that on 17 April 2000 at around 2 p.m. a patrol had come running to headquarters and reported that a military convoy had been stopped in Lenina Street because a serviceman had shot a schoolboy. When T-v. arrived at the crime scene, he had been told that a serviceman had climbed from an APC to a ZIL vehicle where other servicemen had tried to hide him. 31. Serviceman I., questioned on the same date, submitted that on 17 April 2000 his fellow servicemen had told him that a serviceman from a convoy moving through Dyshne-Vedeno had killed a boy. When he had arrived at the crime scene, eye-witnesses indicated an APC from which, according to them, shots had been fired. A serviceman had been acting agitatedly around the APC. He had appeared to be nervous and had been holding an AKSM 7.62 automatic rifle with no silencer. He had then gone to sit in the ZIL-131 truck. In the course of the search of the ZIL truck officers of the Vedeno District military commander’s office had found a magazine of cartridges and a silencer. 32. Ts., questioned on 24 July and 26 October 2000, submitted that he had been present at the examination of Ayub Salatkhanov’s body and had seen bullet wounds. A spent 7.62 cartridge case had been found by T. and immediately handed over to the police officer who had conducted the inspection. 33. On 26 July 2000 an investigative experiment concerning the audibility of shots fired from an AKSM automatic rifle with a silencer was conducted. 34. On 31 July, 16 and 19 October 2000 expert Sh. was questioned. 35. On 3 August 2000 a forensic examination of Ayub Salatkhanov’s clothes was completed. 36. On 5 August 2000 servicemen P., K. and P-o were questioned. They submitted that after two AKSM automatic rifles with two PBS-1 silencers, including the one seized from Ch., had been returned to the military unit, they had been used according to their purpose. They had not been repaired and no parts of them had been replaced either. 37. On 8 August 2000 Sh-n, a serviceman that had formed a part of the military convoy, submitted that when the convoy had been moving he had seen a boy lying on the ground in the yard of a house. When the convoy had stopped, he had seen a serviceman sitting on the right side of the ZIL-131 truck removing a silencer from his automatic rifle. When the serviceman had left the car, there had been no silencer on his automatic rifle. 38. On 16 August 2000 a forensic expert examination was completed. 39. On 9 September 2000 a ballistic expert examination was completed. 40. On 27 September 2000 serviceman O. was questioned. He submitted that in the convoy it was only special forces servicemen who had had PBS-1 silencers. 41. On 11 October 2000 a forensic examination of Ayub Salatkhanov’s body was completed. 42. On 15 November 2000 Ch. was charged with the offence and a decision to place him in custody was taken. However, since he was no longer in the Chechen Republic, he was placed on the wanted list. The investigation was suspended on the same date on account of Ch.’s whereabouts being unknown. 43. On 25 November 2000 a forensic expert’s examination was completed. 44. On 11 March 2001 the military prosecutor of military unit no. 20102 informed the applicants that the investigation had identified the suspect – Ch., warrant officer of military unit no. 75143. However, the military unit had been relocated out of Chechnya without the military prosecutor’s knowledge. Warrant officer Ch. had absconded and on 15 November 2000 had been placed on the wanted list. 45. By a letter dated 27 July 2001 (received by the applicant in December 2001) the military prosecutor of military unit no. 20102 informed the applicants that the serviceman responsible for the murder of their son had been identified. He had been discharged from military service and had absconded. He had been searched for by the officers of the Ostrovskiy district police of the Pskov Region, where his residence was located. The letter further stated that on 15 November 2000 the investigation had been suspended during the search. On 25 July 2001 the investigation was resumed, and a request for a search to be carried out was forwarded to the authorities in Ukraine, where the suspect’s parents resided. 46. On 8 August 2001 the Chief Military Prosecutor’s Office informed the applicants that the investigation into their son’s murder had been reopened. The person suspected of the crime had absconded and had been placed on the federal wanted list. 47. On 8 October 2001 the Prosecutor’s Office of the North Caucasia Military Circuit informed the applicants that on 2 April 2001 the decision of 15 August 2000 to suspend the proceedings had been quashed and the case file had been forwarded for further investigation to the military prosecutor of military unit no. 20102. The investigation was pending, and the applicants would be informed of the results. 48. After a number of stops and starts, the investigation was again resumed on 17 January 2005. Ch.’s whereabouts were established and it was also found that he had changed his name to M. He was subsequently arrested, and on 18 April 2005 the case was committed for trial to the Grozny Garrison Military Court. 49. On 7 July 2006 the Grozny Garrison Military Court dismissed Ch.’s (M.’s) contradictory submissions that, firstly, it had not been him who had shot at Ayub Salatkhanov and, secondly, that he had accidentally pulled the trigger when the vehicle he had been in had gone over a bump in the road. The court found that Ch. (M.) had aimed at Ayub Salatkhanov’s chest, found him guilty of murder and sentenced him to ten years’ imprisonment. Ch. (M.) appealed. 50. On 23 November 2006 the North Caucasia District Military Court upheld the judgment on appeal. 51. In 2003 the second applicant brought a claim against the Ministry of Finance for compensation for non-pecuniary damage caused by the murder of his son by a serviceman. 52. On 22 July 2003 the Basmanniy District Court of Moscow dismissed the claim. The court held, in particular: “As follows from the evidence in the case, the fact that [the applicant] was caused physical and moral suffering arose as a result of the fulfilment of duties by a serviceman of military unit no. 75143 [Ch.] ... It is precisely [this military unit] which may be liable if [its serviceman] caused non-pecuniary damage when fulfilling [his] duties.” 53. On 12 February 2004 the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment on appeal. 54. Subsequently, within the framework of the criminal proceedings against Ch. (M.), the second applicant brought a civil claim for compensation for non-pecuniary damage in the amount of 10,100,000 Russian roubles (RUR) before the criminal case against Ch. was sent for trial. 55. In the hearing of 29 June 2006 counsel for the second applicant withdrew the civil claim. He explained that the second applicant intended to file a claim for damages against the military unit where Ch. (M.) had served within the framework of civil proceedings. The court accepted the withdrawal of the claim and specifically stated that it was open to the second applicant to file it within the framework of civil proceedings. 56. According to the Government, the second applicant did not file any civil claims before the Grozny Garrison Military Court. 57. Despite specific requests made by the Court on two occasions, the Government did not submit a copy of the entire investigation file concerning the murder of Ayub Salatkhanov. However, after the application had been declared admissible they submitted an update on the progress of the investigation, copies of judicial decisions and minutes of the hearings, which contained a detailed description of the investigative actions and witnesses’ statements. The Government stated that the documents submitted contained detailed information concerning the conduct of the investigation and the trial and, should the Court require any additional documents, it should specifically request them. 58. Until 1 July 2002 criminal-law matters were governed by the 1960 Code of Criminal Procedure of the RSFSR. On 1 July 2002 the old Code was replaced by the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation (CCP). 59. Article 125 of the CCP provides that the decision of an investigator or prosecutor to dispense with or terminate criminal proceedings, and other decisions and acts or omissions which are liable to infringe the constitutional rights and freedoms of the parties to criminal proceedings or to impede citizens’ access to justice, may be appealed against to a district court, which is empowered to examine the lawfulness and grounds of the impugned decisions. 60. Article 161 of the CCP enshrines the rule that information from the preliminary investigation may not be disclosed. Part 3 of the same Article provides that information from the investigation file may be divulged with the permission of a prosecutor or investigator and only in so far as it does not infringe the rights and lawful interests of the participants in the criminal proceedings and does not prejudice the investigation. 61. Article 151 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, Part II, in force since 1 March 1996, provides for a right to claim non-pecuniary damage. Article 1100 of the Civil Code provides grounds for compensation of non-pecuniary damage.",[],[],[],['38'],[],[],0

The applicant was arrested and detained on remand on 30 November 1991 on suspicion of aggravated fraud of about one billion zlotys. The Wrocław Śródmieście District Prosecutor considered that the detention was necessary in view of the dangerousness of the offence concerned and in order to ensure the proper conduct of the proceedings. 11. On 31 August 1992 the bill of indictment was transmitted to the Wrocław Regional Court. On 13 November 1992 the President of the Court found that the indictment was complete and decided that the case could be heard by the court. 12. From 3 to 10 December 1992 the applicant was treated at a specialist hospital. 13. The first hearing was held on 22 and 23 December 1992 and one of the accused was questioned. The next hearing, set for 26 January 1993, was adjourned as the applicant first requested to be granted access to the case-file, and after the court refused, having regard to the fact that the applicant had already had such access from 7 to 17 September 1992, he stated that he felt unwell. On 27 January 1993 the applicant again unsuccessfully requested access to the file and stated that he could not participate in the hearing on health grounds. The court ordered the applicant’s examination by a specialist in forensic medicine. 14. At a hearing on 2 February 1993 the applicant complained of bad health. The hearing set for 3 February 1993 was then cancelled and adjourned to 11 March 1993. On 11 March 1993 the court adjourned the hearing as its order of 27 January 1993 for the applicant’s medical examination had not been carried out. 15. On 4 April 1993 the applicant submitted a request for release. 16. On 8 and 9 April 1993 the hearing was adjourned as a lay judge and one of the accused were not present. Apparently a new hearing was fixed for 13 and 14 April 1993, but then adjourned to 17 until 21 May 1993. 17. On 26 April 1993 a medical expert opinion was submitted to the Court which stated that the applicant’s health condition did not prevent him from participating in the proceedings and was not incompatible with his detention. 18. On 4 May 1993 the applicant requested his release, invoking Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. He submitted that the bill of indictment did not disclose a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question. He also complained of the length of his detention. 19. On 6 May 1993 the Wrocław Regional Court refused to allow the applicant’s requests for release of 4 April and 4 May 1993. The court found that the evidence gathered so far supported a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences concerned, and that his release would jeopardise the court proceedings, in particular as they were in their initial phase. 20. On 6 May 1993 the Court also informed the applicant that the hearing of 13 and 14 April 1993 had been adjourned ""for objective organisational reasons"". 21. On 6 May 1993 the applicant withdrew his lawyer’s power of attorney, complaining that the latter had failed to comply with the applicant’s request to contact him. 22. On 11 May 1993 the applicant appealed to the Wrocław Court of Appeal against the decision of 6 May 1993 refusing his requests for release. He submitted that this decision had not been issued within the three-day time-limit provided for by law, and that his lawyer was not entitled to attend the examination of his request, whereas the prosecutor was. He complained that the Regional Court had failed to consider his argument based on Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. He pointed out that the court’s statement that the judicial proceedings were in an initial phase confirmed his complaint that the proceedings were not progressing. On the same day the applicant submitted his further request for release. 23. At the hearing on 17 May 1993 it was established that the Regional Court had intercepted the applicant’s letter to his lawyer and transmitted it to him only on 14 May 1993. The hearing set for 17 until 21 May 1993 was therefore adjourned to 13 and 14 July 1993 in order to allow the applicant time to be assigned an officially appointed lawyer as he had withdrawn his power of attorney for his counsel. Apparently, also on 17 May 1993, the Wrocław Regional Court refused the applicant’s further request for release. The applicant appealed against this decision to the Wrocław Court of Appeal, invoking Article 5 § 3 and Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. He submitted that there had been no progress in the proceedings since 22 December 1992, i.e. the date of the first hearing. 24. On 3 June 1993 the Wrocław Court of Appeal upheld the decision of 6 May 1993 not to release the applicant. The court accepted that the Regional Court had breached Article 214 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in that it had considered the applicant’s request of 4 April 1993 only after a month, instead of within three days. With regard to the applicant’s complaint that the Regional Court had failed to consider his complaints under Article 5 § 3 and Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, the court considered that it was sufficient that the Regional Court’s decision was well-founded and in accordance with Article 217 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 25. On 21 June 1993 the applicant again requested his release. He submitted that his detention was unjustified and too long. He complained that there was no reasonable progress in the proceedings. On 24 June 1993 the Wrocław Regional Court dismissed this request. 26. On 24 June 1993 the President of the Wrocław Regional Court, apparently in reply to the applicant’s letters, stated that the proceedings were not exceeding a reasonable time. He stated that ""the length of the proceedings is due to various circumstances, including the state of your health and the court’s efforts (...) to guarantee your defence rights"". 27. In a letter of 1 July 1993 the applicant complained to the Regional Court about the length of the proceedings. 28. On 2 July 1993 the applicant appealed against the decision of 24 June 1993. He stated that this decision was in breach of Article 5 § 3 and Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. On 8 July 1993 the Wrocław Court of Appeal dismissed this request as the applicant had failed to submit any new arguments which would justify his release. 29. The hearing set for 13 and 14 July 1993 was not held as the lawyer of one of the applicant’s co-accused failed to appear. 30. On 6 August 1993 judge A.Z. of the Regional Court informed the applicant in reply to his letter of 1 July 1993 that his complaints about the length of the proceedings were inappropriate. The judge stated that ""as two accused were detained on remand, the dates of hearings were being set in the manner foreseen for cases of this kind and in accordance with the existing facilities of the court"". 31. On 10 August 1993 one of the lay judges failed to appear and the hearing was adjourned. On 11 August 1993 another co-accused was ill. The hearing was adjourned to 23 August 1993. 32. On 19 August 1993 the Wrocław Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the Regional Court’s decision of 24 June 1993. The court considered that the applicant had failed to indicate any new circumstances justifying his release. 33. On 23 August 1993 the hearing was discontinued at 12.20 p.m. as one judge had to leave the court urgently. 34. On 24 August 1993 the President of the Wrocław Regional Court informed the Polish Helsinki Committee, to whom the applicant had apparently complained, that the case was complex. He submitted that as the applicant had frequently submitted requests for release, the case-file had to be sent to the Court of Appeal and thus it was impossible to set the dates of the hearing before the Wrocław Regional Court. On 26 and 27 January and on 2 February 1993 the hearing had not been held as the applicant had been ill. Moreover, the applicant had wished to have access to the case-file, which had prevented the court from holding the hearing. The President confirmed that on 8 and 9 April 1993 the lay judge had failed to appear. 35. On 1 September, 17 September and 5 October 1993 no hearings were held as one of the co-accused had failed to appear. 36. On 16 September 1993 the applicant underwent a medical examination in the prison out-patient ward and was subsequently referred to the prison hospital. 37. On 28 September 1993 the applicant wrote a letter to the Minister of Justice, complaining about the length of the proceedings. 38. On 12 October 1993 a medical panel found that the applicant’s condition necessitated a minor surgical intervention in the prison hospital and that his condition could be treated in prison and was not incompatible with his detention. 39. The next hearing was held on 22 October 1993. The hearing set for 15 November 1993 was not held as the judge received a promotion on that day. The hearing set for 3 December 1993 was not held as one of the accused had failed to attend. 40. On 3 December 1993 the Wrocław Regional Court decided to release the applicant. The court considered that the case was no longer in an initial stage and ample evidence had been gathered. Thus, the risk that the applicant would jeopardise the proceedings by hiding or suppressing evidence had diminished. The detention had therefore become devoid of its purpose. The court found no risk of absconding as the applicant wished to get married. 41. Hearings set on 4 and 31 January 1994 were not held as one of the co-accused, W.D., had failed to appear. 42. On 22 March 1994 the Wrocław Medical Academy Institute of Forensic Medicine informed the court that W.D. had failed to comply with the summons for a medical examination. Subsequent summonses were not served on him and the postal authorities informed the court that he had moved. 43. The Wrocław Regional Court set the next date for a hearing for 6 October 1994. This hearing started at 9 a.m. The court decided to separate the case of W.D. from that of the applicant as it transpired that he had left the country, and to continue the hearing. The applicant objected thereto, complaining that his new counsel had not had enough time to study the case-file. The court refused to grant this request. The hearing was nevertheless adjourned at 11.40 a.m. due to a bomb alert in the court. 44. The hearing set for 24 November 1994 was not held as two accused, including the applicant, were ill. The applicant’s lawyer did not submit a relevant medical certificate. 45. The hearing fixed for 16 January 1995 was adjourned due to the applicant’s bad health. The applicant’s counsel stated that he had tried to establish contact with his client, but to no avail. The court adjourned the hearing and ordered the applicant to submit a medical certificate to confirm his bad health. On 26 January 1995 the applicant submitted a sick leave certificate from 16 to 21 January 1995. 46. The hearing set for 1 March 1995 was adjourned for personal reasons concerning the judge. From 27 February to 2 March 1995 the applicant was in a hospital for treatment. 47. On 16 March 1995 the court requested the Institute of Forensic Medicine of the Wrocław Medical Academy to examine the applicant in order to verify whether his health allowed him to participate in the proceedings. The applicant did not comply with the relevant summonses for 18 April and 11 May 1995. The applicant was summoned to the court for 26 May 1995 in order to explain the reasons for his failure to undergo the medical examination. He undertook to comply with the court’s order. However, he subsequently failed again to report for the examination. On 13 July and 22 August 1995 the court again requested the Institute to examine the applicant, but he failed to comply with the relevant summonses. 48. On 25 November 1995 the applicant was re-arrested in connection with another criminal case pending against him. On 6 February 1996 he was examined at the Institute of Forensic Medicine. According to a medical opinion, his health was not such as to prevent him from attending the hearings. On 26 February 1996 the applicant withdrew his counsel’s power of attorney and requested the court to appoint for him a lawyer paid under the legal aid scheme. The court allowed his request by a decision of 4 March 1996. 49. On 5 March 1996 the court decided to re-open the trial as the composition of the panel of judges had changed. At the same hearing the applicant’s lawyer informed the court that the applicant had withdrawn his power of attorney. The court refused the applicant’s request to have the hearing adjourned for lack of a sufficient time to prepare his defence. 50. On 11 March 1996 the applicant challenged all judges of that court. On 15 March 1996 the Wrocław Regional Court appointed a new defence counsel for the applicant. By a decision of 10 April 1995 the Wrocław Court of Appeal dismissed the challenge of the judges as unfounded. 51. On 10 April 1996 one of the co-defendants J.S. was arrested and remanded in custody. 52. A hearing set for 22 April 1996 was not held as the court had failed to inform the applicant’s officially assigned lawyer thereof. On 7 June 1996 the applicant again challenged all judges of the Wrocław Regional Court. On 14 June 1996 the Wrocław Court of Appeal dismissed this motion, and held a hearing, at which two co-defendants were questioned. The next hearing was held on 13 September 1996. On 14 October 1996 the hearing was adjourned as one of the accused had failed to attend. On 25 October 1996 the judge was ill. The next hearing was held on 12 December 1996. 53. On 30 January 1997 the hearing was adjourned as the defence counsel for one of the accused, L.B., failed to attend. At that hearing the applicant complained to the court that his lawyer did not represent him properly. On 3 February 1997 the hearing was struck out of the court’s list as one of the lawyers failed to attend. On 10 February 1996 the applicant’s lawyer requested the court to discharge her from the obligation to defend the applicant, arguing that his statements as to her alleged lack of co-operation with the applicant were untrue. On 28 February 1997 one of the accused failed to comply with the summonses and the court adjourned the hearing. On the same day the applicant and his lawyer withdrew their request for the change of the applicant’s defence counsel. 54. On 14 March 1997 the hearing was adjourned at the applicant’s request, the applicant invoking his bad health. On 11 April 1997 the hearing was discontinued after two hours, as a medical certificate as to the applicant’s bad health had not been submitted to the court by the prison authorities. The court ordered that the applicant be examined by physicians. 55. The next hearing was held on 5 May 1997. The applicant was questioned by the court. His questioning was discontinued and the applicant requested the court to adjourn the hearing in view of his bad health. 56. The hearing scheduled for 20 June 1997 was cancelled at the request of one of the defendants. On 18 August 1997 the Court fixed the dates of the next hearings for 10, 13 and 20 October 1997. On 28 September 1997 the court appointed a new legal aid lawyer for the applicant as the previous lawyer had to step down due to health problems. The hearing scheduled for 10 October 1997 was adjourned at the applicant’s and his new lawyer’s requests as they had not had sufficient time to prepare the defence. The next hearing was held on 20 October 1997. On 31 October 1997 the applicant complained about the allegedly inadequate conduct of the case by his new counsel. 57. The next hearing was held on 18 December 1997. On 22 December 1997 the applicant requested again that a new counsel be appointed for him. At a hearing held on 28 January 1998 the applicant again complained about the alleged lack of competence of his new lawyer and stated that he was not ready to submit any motions in defence. The court adjourned the hearing until 23 March 1998. On 9 February 1998 the applicant again requested that his lawyer be replaced. The subsequent hearings were held on 23 and 25 March 1998. 58. On 27 March 1998 the Wrocław Regional Court pronounced a judgment, by which the applicant was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. On 24 November 1998 the applicant was served with the written grounds for the judgment. On 3 December 1998 the applicant and on 21 December 1998 his defence counsel appealed against the first-instance judgment. On 25 February 1999 the Wrocław Court of Appeal fixed the date of the hearing to be held in the appellate proceedings. On 25 March 1999 the applicant requested the court to adjourn the hearing as he had been placed in a psychiatric hospital. On 31 March 1999 the request was allowed and the hearing was cancelled. 59. On 6 April 1999 the Wrocław Court of Appeal requested information from the hospital as to the expected duration of the applicant’s stay. On 14 April 1999 the court was informed that the applicant would likely be discharged in the first half of June 1999. 60. A hearing was held on 17 June 1999. On 21 June 1999 the Wrocław Court of Appeal upheld the first instance judgment. 61. The 1973 Code of Criminal Procedure, applicable at the relevant time, listed as ""preventive measures"", inter alia, detention on remand, bail and police supervision. 62 63. After the bill of indictment was transmitted to the court, orders relating to detention were to be made by the court. A decision concerning preventive measures could be appealed to a higher court. 64. Article 217 of the old Code of Criminal Procedure, provided that a person could be held in detention on remand if there were serious grounds for believing that he or she would abscond, in particular when he or she did not have a permanent address or his/her identity could not be established. Further, detention could be imposed if there were serious grounds for believing that there was a risk of collusion or that an accused would otherwise jeopardise criminal proceedings. Finally, alternative grounds for detention on remand were either the fact that an accused was charged with an offence of a particular danger to society, or that he was a recidivist within the meaning of the Criminal Code. 65. The notion of “danger to society” as set out in the Criminal Code related to the assessment of the seriousness of criminal offences and, if the ""danger to society"" represented by a given offence was serious, this was also an aggravating circumstance which the court had to take into consideration when determining a sentence. 66. Pursuant to Article 218 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, if there were no special considerations to the contrary, detention on remand should not be imposed or should be lifted, if it involved danger to life or limb or entailed particular hardship for a suspect or his family. 67. After the Interim Law of 1 December 1995 entered into force on 1 January 1996, grounds of imposition of detention on remand were restricted to situations in which there was a reasonable risk of absconding, in particular when his identity could not be established or he had no permanent domicile. Secondly, detention could be imposed if there was a reasonable risk that he would attempt to induce witnesses to give false testimony or to hinder the proper course of proceedings by any other unlawful means. 68. At the material time there were three types of proceedings enabling a detainee to challenge the lawfulness of his detention. Under Article 221 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure he could appeal to a court against a detention order given by a prosecutor (see above). Under Article 222 §§ 2 (1) and 3 he could appeal against a further decision by that court prolonging his detention at a prosecutor’s request. Under Article 214 the detainee could at any time request the competent authority to quash or alter the decision concerning the preventive measure imposed in his case. Such an application had to be decided by the prosecutor or, after the bill of indictment had been lodged with the court competent to deal with the case, by that court, within three days.",[],[],[],"['5', '6']","['5-3', '6-1']",[],0
95,001-22397,ENG,DEU,ADMISSIBILITY,2002,GÖRGES v. GERMANY,4,Inadmissible,Ireneu Cabral Barreto,"The applicant, Uwe Görges, is a German national, who was born in 1946 and lives in Hamburg, Germany. He is represented before the Court by Hans Kober, a lawyer practising in Hamburg. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. In spring 1986, criminal investigations were initiated against the applicant on the suspicion of his participation in planning several transactions of illegal sales of weapons to the Republic of Iran. On 30 September 1991, the Hamburg District Court convicted the applicant of several counts of offences under the Law to Control International Weaponry (Kriegswaffenkontrollgesetz). It found that he had counselled and participated in planning the illegal sales of weapons to the Republic of Iran. The applicant was sentenced to seven months’ imprisonment on probation. On 20 July 1994, the Hamburg Regional Court, upon the applicant’s appeal, amended the District Court’s decision to the effect that he was found guilty of only one offence under the Law to Control International Weaponry. It imposed a fine amounting to 90 daily rates of 60 DEM (approximately 30 Euro). On 2 September 1996, following the applicant’s appeal on points of law, the Hanseatic Court of Appeal repealed this decision and referred the case back to a different chamber of the Hamburg Regional Court. It found that the procedural delays caused by judicial organs had not been taken into account by the lower court. On 11 April 1997, the Hamburg Regional Court confirmed its decision of 20 July 1994. It briefly mentioned the delays in proceedings, but found that, bearing in mind the gravity of the offence, 90 daily rates was the lowest possible sentence. On 15 October 1997, the Hanseatic Court of Appeal, following the applicant’s second appeal on points of law, also quashed the decision of April 1997 and referred the case back to yet another chamber of the Hamburg Regional Court. It found that the judicial organs had unnecessarily prolonged proceedings for more than four years and that this constituted a violation of the German Basic Law (Grundgesetz) and of Article 6 of the Convention. However, it found that, contrary to the applicant’s submissions, this did not constitute a procedural impediment that would warrant for proceedings to be discontinued. Finally, the Court of Appeal noted that in its decisions, the Regional Court had failed to show if and to what extent the excessive length of proceedings had an effect on the sentence. On 13 January 1998, the Hamburg Regional Court amended the decisions of 20 July 1994 and 2 September 1996 while changing the sentence to the effect that the fine was reduced to 80 daily rates of 60 DEM. It found that the following delays had been unnecessary and were attributable to the judicial organs: although the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Hamburg had been in possession of most of the relevant information by December 1988, the indictment was not submitted before July 1990, which amounted to a delay of about one year and five months. The District Court’s decision of 30 September 1991, having been finalised for service on 9 December 1991, was not served upon the applicant before 11 March 1992, i. e. three months later. The proceedings were not furthered between April 1992 and April 1993, when the case was transferred to another Chamber of the Regional Court. In appeal proceedings before the Hanseatic Court of Appeal, the Office of the Public Prosecutor took about one year and eight months (October 1994 - June 1996) to submit its memorial to the Court of Appeal. These delays amounted to four years in total. The Regional Court found that the delays and the excessive length of proceedings were in breach of the German Basic Law and Article 6 of the Convention. Having regard to all circumstances, the Regional Court concluded that the procedural delays did not require that the proceedings be discontinued. Weighing all personal mitigating and aggravating factors, the Regional Court found that, without taking account of the procedural delays, it would have imposed a fine of 120 daily rates of 60 DEM. It reduced the fine to 90 daily rates, on account of the above-mentioned delays in the past, and, in a second step, further reduced the fine to 80 daily rates, considering the further delays caused by the appeal proceedings. On 26 April 1999, the Hanseatic Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s appeal. On 28 June 1999, the Federal Constitutional Court refused to entertain the applicant’s constitutional complaint. The Federal Constitutional Court found, in particular, that the Hamburg Regional Court had given a detailed account of the delays attributable to the judiciary and had taken these delays into account when reducing the fine by 40 daily rates. The reduced fine did not reach the statutory limits for inclusion in a certificate of good conduct (Führungszeugnis) and would be removed from the applicant’s criminal record after the minimum statutory period. The Regional Court had therefore sufficiently reduced the sentence on account of the procedural delays.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
96,001-61080,ENG,GBR,CHAMBER,2003,CASE OF APPLEBY AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,1,No violation of Art. 10;No violation of Art. 11;No violation of Art. 13,Matti Pellonpää;Nicolas Bratza,"10. The first, second and third applicants were born in 1952, 1966 and 1947 respectively and live in Washington (Tyne and Wear), where the fourth applicant, an environmental group set up by the applicants, is also based. 11. The new town centre of Washington is known as “the Galleries” and is located within an area now owned by Postel Properties Limited (“Postel”), a private company. This town centre was originally built by the Washington Development Corporation (“the Corporation”), a body set up by the government of the United Kingdom pursuant to an Act of Parliament to build the “new” centre. The centre was sold to Postel on 30 December 1987. 12. The Galleries, as owned by Postel at the relevant time, comprised a shopping mall (with two hypermarkets and major shops), the surrounding car parks with spaces for approximately 3,000 cars and walkways. Public services were also available in the vicinity. However, the freehold of the careers’ office and the public library was owned by the Council, the social services office and health centre were leased to the Council by the Secretary of State and the freehold of the police station was held on behalf of Northumbria Police Authority. There was a post office within the Galleries and also the offices of the housing department, leased to the Council by Postel. 13. Around September 1997 the Council gave outline planning permission to the City of Sunderland College to build on a part of Princess Anne Park in Washington known as the Arena. The Arena is the only playing field in the vicinity of Washington town centre which is available for use by the local community. The first to third applicants, together with other concerned residents, formed the fourth applicant to campaign against the college’s proposal and to persuade the Council not to grant the college permission to build on the field. 14. On or around 14 March 1998 the first applicant, together with her husband and son, set up two stands at the entrance of the shopping mall in the Galleries, displaying posters alerting the public to the likely loss of the open space and seeking signatures to present to the Council on behalf of Washington First Forum. Security guards employed by Postel would not let the first applicant or her assistants continue to collect signatures on any land or premises owned by Postel. The applicants had to remove their stands and stop collecting signatures. 15. The manager of one of the hypermarkets gave the applicants permission to set up stands within that store in March 1998, allowing them to transmit their message and to collect signatures, albeit from a reduced number of people. However, the same permission was not granted in April 1998 when the applicants wanted to collect signatures for a further petition. 16. On 10 April 1998 the third applicant, as acting chair of Washington First Forum, wrote to the manager of the Galleries asking for permission to set up a stand and to canvass views from the public either inside the mall itself or in the adjacent car parks and offered to pay to be allowed to do so. In his reply of 14 April 1998, the manager of the Galleries refused access. His letter read as follows: “... the Galleries is unique in as much as although it is the Town Centre, it is also privately owned. The owner’s stance on all political and religious issues, is one of strict neutrality and I am charged with applying this philosophy. I am therefore obliged to refuse permission for you to carry out a petition within the Galleries or the adjacent car parks.” 17. On 19 April 1998 the third applicant wrote again to the manager of the Galleries, asking him to reconsider his decision. His letter remained unanswered. 18. The fourth applicant continued to try and reach the public by setting up stands by the roadside on public footpaths and going to the old town centre at Concord which, however, is visited by a much smaller number of Washington residents. 19. The deadline for letters of representation to the Council regarding the building works was 1 May 1998. On 30 April 1998 the applicants submitted the 3,200 letters of representation they had obtained. 20. The fourth applicant has produced a list of associations and others which were given permission to carry out collections, set up stands and displays within the Galleries. These included: the Salvation Army (collection before Christmas), local school choirs (carol-singing and collection before Christmas), the Stop Smoking Campaign (advertising display and handing out of nicotine patches), the Blood Transfusion Service (blood collection), the Royal British Legion (collection for Armistice Day), various photographers (advertising and taking of photographs) and British Gas (staffed advertising display). 21. From 31 January to 6 March 2001, Sunderland Council ran a consultation campaign under the banner “Your Council, Your Choice”, informing the local residents of three leadership choices for the future of the Council and were allowed to use the Galleries for this purpose. This was a statutory consultation exercise carried out under section 25 of the Local Government Act 2000, which required local authorities to draw up proposals for the operation of “executive arrangements” and consult local electors before sending them to the Secretary of State. Some 8,500 people were reported as having responded to the survey. 22. At common law, a private property owner may, in certain circumstances, be presumed to have extended an implied invitation to members of the public to come onto his land for lawful purposes. This is the case with commercial premises, such as shops, theatres and restaurants, as well as private premises (for example, there is a presumption that a house owner authorises people to come up the path to his front door to deliver letters or newspapers or for political canvassing). Any implied invitation may be revoked at will. A private person’s ability to eject people from his land is generally unfettered and he does not have to justify his conduct or comply with any test of reasonableness. 23. In CIN Properties Ltd v. Rawlins ([1995] 2 EGLR (Estates Gazette Law Reports) 130), where the applicants (young men) were barred from a shopping centre in Wellingborough as the private company owner CIN considered that their behaviour was a nuisance, the Court of Appeal held that CIN had the right to determine any licence which the applicants might have had to enter the centre. In giving judgment, Lord Phillips found that the local authority had not entered into any walkways agreement with the company within the meaning of section 18(1) of the Highways Act 1971 (later replaced by section 35 of the Highways Act 1980) which would have dedicated the walkways or footpaths as public rights of way and which would have given the local council the power to issue by-laws regulating the use of those rights of way. Nor was there any basis for finding an equitable licence. He also considered case-law from North America concerning the applicants’ arguments for the finding of some kind of public right: “Of more obvious relevance are two North American cases. In Uston v. Resorts International Inc. (1982) N.J. 445A.2d 370, the Supreme Court of New Jersey laid down as a general proposition that when property owners open their premises – in that case a gaming casino – to the general public in pursuit of their own property interests, they have no right to exclude people unreasonably but, on the contrary, have a duty not to act in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner towards persons who come on their premises. However, that decision was based upon a previous decision of the same court in State v. Schmid (1980) N.J. 423A 2d 615, which clearly turned upon the constitutional freedoms of the First Amendment. The general proposition cited above has no application in English law. The case of Harrison v. Carswell (1975) 62 D.L.R. 3d 68 in the Supreme Court of Canada concerned the right of an employee of a tenant in a shopping centre to picket her employer in the centre, against the wishes of the owner of the centre. The majority of the Supreme Court held that she had no such right and that the owner of the centre had sufficient control or possession of the common areas to enable it to invoke the remedy of trespass. However, Laskin C.J.C., in a strong dissenting judgment held that since a shopping centre was freely accessible to the public, the public did not enter under a revocable licence subject only to the owner’s whim. He said that the case involved a search for an appropriate legal framework for new social facts and – ’If it was necessary to categorise the legal situation which, in my view, arises upon the opening of a shopping centre, with public areas of the kind I have mentioned (at least where the opening is not accompanied by an announced limitation on the classes of public entrants), I would say that the members of the public are privileged visitors whose privilege is revocable only upon misbehaviour (and I need not spell out here what this embraces) or by reason of unlawful activity. Such a view reconciles both the interests of the shopping centre owner and of members of the public, doing violence to neither and recognising the mutual or reciprocal commercial interests of shopping centre owner, business tenants and members of the public upon which the shopping centre is based.’ I have already said that this was a dissenting judgment. Nevertheless counsel [for the applicants] submitted that we should apply it in the present case. I accept that courts may have to be ready to adapt the law to new social facts where necessary. However there is no such necessity where Parliament has already made adequate provision for the new social facts in question as it has here by section 18 of the Highways Act 1971 and section 35 of the Highways Act 1980. (Harrison v. Carswell makes no mention of any similar legislation in Canada.) Where Parliament has legislated and the Council, as representing the public, chooses not to invoke the machinery which the statute provides, it is not for the courts to intervene. I would allow this appeal ... on the basis that CIN had the right, subject only to the issue under section 20 of the Race Relations Act 1976, to determine any licence the [applicants] may have had to enter the Centre.” 24. The parties have referred to case-law from the United States and Canada. 25. The First Amendment to the Federal Constitution protects freedom of speech and peaceful assembly. 26. The United States Supreme Court has accepted a general right of access to certain types of public places, such as streets and parks, known as “public fora” for the exercise of free speech (Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organisation, 307 U.S. (United States: Supreme Court Reports) 496 (1939)). In Marsh v. Alabama (326 U.S. 501, 66 S.Ct. (Supreme Court Reporter) 276, 90 L.Ed. (United States Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers’ Edition) 265 (1946)), the Supreme Court also held that a privately owned corporate town (a company town) having all the characteristics of other municipalities was subject to the First Amendment rights of free speech and peaceable assembly. It has found that the First Amendment does not require access to privately owned properties, such as shopping centres, on the basis that there has to be “State action” (a degree of State involvement) for the amendment to apply (see, for example, Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U.S. 507 (1976)). 27. The United States Supreme Court has taken the position that the First Amendment does not prevent a private shopping-centre owner from prohibiting distribution on its premises of leaflets unrelated to its own operations (Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 47 U.S. 551, 92 S.Ct. 2219, 33 L.Ed. 2d 131 (1972)). This did not however prevent State constitutional provisions from adopting more expansive liberties than the Federal Constitution to permit individuals reasonably to exercise free speech and petition rights on the property of a privately owned shopping centre to which the public was invited and this did not violate the property rights of the shopping-centre owner so long as any restriction did not amount to taking without compensation or contravene any other federal constitutional provisions (Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robbins, 447 U.S. 74, 64 L.Ed. 2d 741, 100 S.Ct. 2035 (1980)). 28. Some State courts have found that a right of access to shopping centres could be derived from provisions in their State constitutions according to which individuals could initiate legislation by gathering a certain number of signatures in a petition or individuals could stand for office by gathering a certain number of signatures (see, for example, Batchelder v. Allied Stores Int’l, N.E. (West’s North Eastern Reporter) 2d 590 (Massachussetts, 1983); Lloyd Corp. v. Whiffen, 849 P. (West’s Pacific Reporter) 2d 446, 453-54 (Oregon, 1993); Southcenter Joint Venture v. National Democratic Policy Comm., 780 P. 2d 1282 (Washington, 1989)). Some cases found State obligations arising due to State involvement, for example, Bock v. Westminster Mall Co., 819 P. 2d 55 (Colorado, 1991) (the shopping centre was a State actor because of financial participation of public authorities in its development and the active presence of government agencies in the common areas), and Jamestown v. Beneda, 477 N.W. (West’s North Western Reporter) 2d 830 (North Dakota, 1991) (where the shopping centre was owned by a public body, although leased to a private developer). 29. Other cases cited as indicating a right to reasonable access to property under State private law were State v. Shack, 277 A. (West’s Atlantic Reporter) 2d 369 (New Jersey, 1971), where the court ruled that under New Jersey property law ownership of real property did not include the right to bar access to governmental services available to migrant workers, in this case a publicly funded non-profit lawyer attempting to advise migrant workers; Uston v. Resorts International, 445 A. 2d 370 (New Jersey, 1982), a New Jersey case concerning casinos where the court held that when property owners open their premises to the general public in pursuit of their own property interests they have no right to exclude people unreasonably (although it was acknowledged that the private law of most States did not require a right of reasonable access to privately owned property, p. 374); and Streetwatch v. National Railroad Passenger Corp., 875 F. Supp. (West’s Federal Supplement) 1055 (Southern District of New York, 1995) concerning the ejection of homeless people from a railway station. 30. States in which courts ruled that free speech provisions in their constitutions did not apply to privately owned shopping centres included Arizona (Fiesta Mall Venture v. Mecham Recall Comm., 767 P. 2d 719 (Court of Appeals, 1989)); Connecticut (Cologne v. Westfarms Assocs, 469 A. 2d 1201 (1984)); Georgia (Citizens for Ethical Gov’t v. Gwinnet Place Assoc., 392 S.E. (West’s South Eastern Reporter) 2d 8 (1990)); Michigan (Woodland v. Michigan Citizens Lobby, 378 N.W. 2d 337 (1985)); Minnesota (State of Minnesota v. Wicklund et al., 7 April 1998 (Court of Appeals)); North Carolina (State of North Carolina v. Felmet, 273 S.E. 2d 708 (1981)); Ohio (Eastwood Mall v. Slanco, 626 N.E. 2d 59 (1994)); Pennsylvania (Western Pa Socialist Workers 1982 Campaign v. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., 515 A. 2d 1331 (1986)); South Carolina (Charleston Joint Venture v. McPherson, 417 S.E. 2d 544 (1992)); Washington (Southcenter Joint Venture v. National Democratic Policy Comm., cited above; and Wisconsin (Jacobs v. Major, 407 N.W. 2d 832 (1987)). 31. Prior to the entry into force of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Canadian Supreme Court had taken the view that the owner of a shopping centre could exclude protesters (Harrison v. Carswell, 62 D.L.R. (Dominion Law Reports) 3d 68 (1975)). After the Charter entered into force, a lower court held that the right to free speech applied in privately owned shopping centres (R. v. Layton, 38 C.C.C. (Canadian Criminal Cases) 3d 550 (1986) (Provincial Court, Judicial District of York, Ontario)). However, an individual judge of the Canadian Supreme Court has since expressed the opposite view, stating obiter that the Charter does not confer a right to use private property as a forum of expression (McLachlin J, Committee for Cth of Can. v. Canada [1991] 1 SCR (Canada Supreme Court Reports) 139, 228).",[],[],[],"['10', '11', '13']",[],[],0
97,001-113014,ENG,FRA,ADMISSIBILITY,2009,OULD DAH v. FRANCE,1,Inadmissible,,"The applicant, Mr Ely Ould Dah, is a Mauritanian national, who was born in 1962. He was represented before the Court by Mrs C. Waquet, a member of the Conseil d’Etat and Court of Cassation Bar. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. Between November 1990 and March 1991 clashes occurred between Mauritanians of Arab-Berber origin and others belonging to black African ethnic groups. Some servicemen from these ethnic groups, accused of mounting a coup d’état, were taken prisoner. Some of them were subjected to acts of torture or barbarity by their guards, among whom was the applicant, an intelligence officer at the Nouakchott army headquarters in Mauritania, holding the rank of lieutenant. On 14 June 1993 an amnesty law was passed in favour of members of the armed forces and the security forces who had committed offences between 1 January 1989 and 18 April 1992 in connection with the events giving rise to armed conflict and acts of violence. By virtue of that law, no proceedings were brought against the applicant for offences committed against prisoners. In August 1998 the applicant, who was by then captain of the Mauritanian army, arrived in France for a training course at the Montpellier Infantry Academy. On 8 June 1999 the International Federation for Human Rights (Féderation Internationale des Ligues des Droits de l’Homme) and the Human Rights League (Ligue des Droits de l’Homme) lodged a criminal complaint against the applicant, together with an application to join the proceedings as civil parties, for acts of torture allegedly committed by him in Mauritania in 1990 and 1991. These criminal proceedings were based on the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (hereinafter “the United Nations Convention against Torture”), adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 10 December 1984, which was ratified by France and came into force on 26 June 1987. The applicant was arrested on 1 July 1999. On 2 July 1999 an investigation was begun and the applicant was charged with committing acts of torture or barbarity. He was placed in pre-trial detention until 28 September 1999, before being released on bail. The applicant absconded on an unknown date. A warrant was issued for his arrest in April 2000. On 25 May 2001 the investigating judge committed the applicant for trial on charges of committing, and aiding and abetting acts of torture and barbarity. The judge based the indictment on the witness evidence of nine former servicemen and the widow of a tenth serviceman. Two of the witnesses, who had taken refuge in France, had been confronted with the applicant during the investigation, while the others had provided written statements. The applicant appealed against the committal order. In a judgment of 8 November 2001, the Investigation Division of the Montpellier Court of Appeal declared the applicant’s appeal inadmissible on the ground that it had been lodged too late. The applicant appealed on points of law. On 6 March 2002 the Court of Cassation quashed the Investigation Division’s judgment and remitted the case to the Nîmes Court of Appeal. In a judgment of 8 July 2002, the Investigation Division of the Nîmes Court of Appeal upheld the order of the investigating judge and committed the applicant for trial before the Gard Assize Court. It found that the condition provided for in Article 1 of the United Nations Convention against Torture was satisfied, as the acts in question had been carried out in the context of an “ethnic purge” and a massive campaign of repression conducted by the Mauritanian government in power at the time, and that the applicant had acknowledged having acted in an official capacity, within the meaning of the Convention provisions, as an intelligence officer and member of the investigating committee. The Investigation Division also considered that the provisions of Articles 689, 689-1 and 689-2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Article 7 § 2 of the United Nations Convention against Torture vested jurisdiction in the French courts to try the case, apply French law and override an amnesty law passed by a foreign State where application of that law would result in a breach of France’s international obligations and render the principle of universal jurisdiction totally ineffective. As the principle of lawfulness did not preclude an offence from being defined in a treaty or an international agreement, the latter prevailing over the law, it held that while “acts of torture” had, since the new Criminal Code, been classified as a “separate crime” defined and punishable under Articles 222-1 et seq. of the Criminal Code, such acts had previously constituted an aggravating circumstance in respect of certain offences, and particularly the crime of aggravated assault provided for in Articles 303 and 309 of the Criminal Code, now repealed, which was a crime punishable by “five to ten years’ imprisonment”. The Investigation Division concluded that the offence with which the applicant was charged – which constituted a crime – was not time-barred and that the only limit in terms of punishment was that only those penalties applicable at the relevant time could be imposed, unless a more lenient criminal law had since been passed. In a judgment of 23 October 2002, the Court of Cassation dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant, finding that the Investigation Division had justified its decision in respect of all the points raised by the applicant. As the applicant had absconded, a summons to appear before the Assize Court was served at the public prosecutor’s office on 13 May 2005. On 30 June 2005 the trial was held before the Gard Assize Court. Counsel for the accused was heard in the latter’s absence. On 1 July 2005 the Assize Court delivered two judgments. In the first one it sentenced the applicant to ten years’ imprisonment for intentionally subjecting certain persons to acts of torture and barbarity and, in addition, causing such acts to be committed against other detainees by abuse of his official position or by giving instructions to servicemen to commit such acts. The Assize Court referred, inter alia, to Articles 303 and 309 of the former Criminal Code, Article 222-1 of the Criminal Code, and to the United Nations Convention against Torture. In the second judgment it awarded damages to the various civil parties. “Any criminals, irrespective of the type of offence they have committed, who use torture or commit acts of barbarity in the execution of their crime shall be punished as being guilty of murder. Anyone who, in perpetrating their offence, uses torture or commits acts of barbarity shall be punished by five to ten years’ imprisonment.” “Anyone who has intentionally wounded another or committed violence or assault resulting in sickness or total unfitness for work for more than eight days shall be liable to between two months’ and two years’ imprisonment and to a fine of between 500 and 20,000 francs or to one of those penalties alone. ...” “Anyone who subjects another to torture or to acts of barbarity shall be liable to fifteen years’ imprisonment. The first two paragraphs of Article 132-23 relating to the minimum term of imprisonment shall apply to the offence provided for in the present Article.” The circular of 14 May 1993, which contains commentaries on the new Criminal Code and the provisions of the Law of 16 December 1992, specifies as follows: “[t]he expression torture and acts of barbarity shall retain the meaning currently ascribed to it in the case-law where such acts are referred to as an aggravating circumstance.” Both the crime instituted by the law and the former aggravating circumstance of torture or acts of barbarity presuppose the establishment of an actus reus, consisting of the commission of one or more acts of exceptional seriousness which go beyond mere violence and cause the victim severe pain or suffering, and mens rea, consisting of the intention to deny a person their human dignity (Indictment Division of the Lyons Court of Appeal, judgment of 19 January 1996, commentary in Recueil Dalloz, 1996, p. 258, and cited in Article 222-1 of Code pénal (“Criminal Code”), ed. Litec). According to the case-law of the Court of Cassation, the new provisions relating to torture and acts of barbarity ensure continuity of the definition of the offence as expressed in the former Criminal Code (Bull. crim. 11 May 2005, Bull. no. 146, appeal no. 05-81331: a court which commits an accused for trial before the Assize Court on the ground that Article 222-3 § 2 of the new Criminal Code – making it a crime to commit torture or acts of barbarity concurrently with a sexual offence – ensures continuity of the offence provided for in former Article 333-1, introduced by the Law of 23 December 1980 and making it an offence to commit indecent assault accompanied by torture or acts of barbarity, makes a proper application of successive criminal laws). The circular of 14 May 1993 also specifies that the provisions of the new Criminal Code are of much broader application than those of the United Nations Convention against Torture, the latter applying only to acts perpetrated by public officials for specific motives. It also indicates that the new definition remedies substantial loopholes in the punishment of the crime by allowing not only the degree of injury suffered by the victim to be taken into account, but also the seriousness of the violent act in question, irrespective of its consequences. In particular, it remedies the disadvantages arising from the inability to punish attempted wilful assault under the former system. “An accused who fails to attend the opening of his or her trial without a valid excuse shall be tried in absentia in accordance with the provisions of the present chapter. The same shall apply where the accused is recorded absent during the proceedings and it is not possible to stay the proceedings pending his or her return. ...” “An accused who is convicted in absentia cannot appeal.” “Perpetrators of or accomplices to offences committed outside the territory of the Republic may be prosecuted and tried by the French courts either where French law is applicable under the provisions of Book I of the Criminal Code or another statute, or where an international convention confers jurisdiction on the French courts to deal with the offence.” “Under the international conventions referred to in the following Articles, anyone who is guilty of having committed any of the offences listed in these provisions outside the territory of the Republic and is present in France may be prosecuted and tried by the French courts. The provisions of the present Article shall apply to attempts to commit these offences, whenever an attempt is punishable.” “For the implementation of the [United Nations] Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted in New York on 10 December 1984, anyone guilty of committing torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention may be prosecuted and tried in accordance with the provisions of Article 689-1.” Article 1 “1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term ‘torture’ means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions. 2. This Article is without prejudice to any international instrument or national legislation which does or may contain provisions of wider application.” Article 2 “1. Each State Party shall take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent acts of torture in any territory under its jurisdiction. 2. No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture. 3. An order from a superior officer or a public authority may not be invoked as a justification of torture.” Article 4 “1. Each State Party shall ensure that all acts of torture are offences under its criminal law. The same shall apply to an attempt to commit torture and to an act by any person which constitutes complicity or participation in torture. 2. Each State Party shall make these offences punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account their grave nature.” Article 5 “1. Each State Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over the offences referred to in Article 4 in the following cases: (a) when the offences are committed in any territory under its jurisdiction or on board a ship or aircraft registered in that State; (b) when the alleged offender is a national of that State; (c) when the victim is a national of that State if that State considers it appropriate. 2. Each State Party shall likewise take such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over such offences in cases where the alleged offender is present in any territory under its jurisdiction and it does not extradite him pursuant to Article 8 to any of the States mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article. 3. This Convention does not exclude any criminal jurisdiction exercised in accordance with internal law.” Article 6 “1. Upon being satisfied, after an examination of information available to it, that the circumstances so warrant, any State Party in whose territory a person alleged to have committed any offence referred to in Article 4 is present shall take him into custody or take other legal measures to ensure his presence. The custody and other legal measures shall be as provided in the law of that State but may be continued only for such time as is necessary to enable any criminal or extradition proceedings to be instituted. 2. Such State shall immediately make a preliminary inquiry into the facts. 3. Any person in custody pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article shall be assisted in communicating immediately with the nearest appropriate representative of the State of which he is a national, or, if he is a stateless person, with the representative of the State where he usually resides. 4. When a State, pursuant to this Article, has taken a person into custody, it shall immediately notify the States referred to in Article 5, paragraph 1, of the fact that such person is in custody and of the circumstances which warrant his detention. The State which makes the preliminary inquiry contemplated in paragraph 2 of this Article shall promptly report its findings to the said States and shall indicate whether it intends to exercise jurisdiction.” Article 7 “1. The State Party in the territory under whose jurisdiction a person alleged to have committed any offence referred to in Article 4 is found shall in the cases contemplated in Article 5, if it does not extradite him, submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution. 2. These authorities shall take their decision in the same manner as in the case of any ordinary offence of a serious nature under the law of that State. In the cases referred to in Article 5, paragraph 2, the standards of evidence required for prosecution and conviction shall in no way be less stringent than those which apply in the cases referred to in Article 5, paragraph 1. 3. Any person regarding whom proceedings are brought in connection with any of the offences referred to in Article 4 shall be guaranteed fair treatment at all stages of the proceedings.” Article 5 “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” Article 3 [common to the four Geneva Conventions] “In the case of armed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, each Party to the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum, the following provisions: 1. Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria. To this end, the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever with respect to the above-mentioned persons: (a) violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture; ... (c) outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment; ...” Article 3 “No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In particular, no one shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or scientific experimentation.” The United Nations Human Rights Committee stated in 1992 in its General Comment No. 20 on Article 7 of the International Covenant that it had noted that some States had granted amnesty in respect of acts of torture, while stating that “amnesties are generally incompatible with the duty of States to investigate such acts; to guarantee freedom from such acts within their jurisdiction; and to ensure that they do not occur in the future. States may not deprive individuals of the right to an effective remedy, including compensation and such full rehabilitation as may be possible” (Compilation of General Comments and General Recommendations Adopted by Human Rights Treaty Bodies, UN Doc. HRI/GEN/1/Rev.1 (1994), p. 30). “1. Every person has the right to have his physical, mental, and moral integrity respected. 2. No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment or treatment. All persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.” Article 4 “... 2. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the following acts against the persons referred to in paragraph 1 are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever: (a) violence to the life, health and physical or mental well-being of persons, in particular murder as well as cruel treatment such as torture, mutilation or any form of corporal punishment; ...” “Every individual shall have the right to the respect of the dignity inherent in a human being and to the recognition of his legal status. All forms of exploitation and degradation of man, particularly slavery, slave trade, torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and treatment, shall be prohibited.” “1. Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and Article 1, the Court shall determine that a case is inadmissible where: (a) the case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution; (b) the case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of the State genuinely to prosecute; (c) the person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and a trial by the Court is not permitted under Article 20, paragraph 3; (d) the case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. 2. In order to determine unwillingness in a particular case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the principles of due process recognised by international law, whether one or more of the following exist, as applicable: (a) the proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court referred to in Article 5; (b) there has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice; (c) the proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice. 3. In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a total or substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings.” In a judgment of 14 February 2002 (Case concerning the Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000, Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium), the International Court of Justice observed that the Democratic Republic of the Congo was no longer invoking the matter of Belgium’s claim to exercise universal jurisdiction and decided to confine its examination to the issue of respect for the immunities which the Congolese Minister for Foreign Affairs enjoyed in the exercise of his functions. The question of the Belgian judge’s powers and, accordingly, the exercise of universal jurisdiction was nonetheless addressed by certain judges in separate opinions annexed to the judgment (particularly, in the above-mentioned case, with regard to the universal jurisdiction by default thus exercised by Belgium). In the case of Prosecutor v. Anto Furundzija (judgment of 10 December 1998 (IT-95-17/1-T)), the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia held as follows: “153. Because of the importance of the values it protects, this principle [the principle of the prohibition against torture] has evolved into a peremptory norm or jus cogens, that is, a norm that enjoys a higher rank in the international hierarchy than treaty law and even ‘ordinary’ customary rules. The most conspicuous consequence of this higher rank is that the principle at issue cannot be derogated from by States through international treaties or local or special customs or even general customary rules not endowed with the same normative force. 154. Clearly, the jus cogens nature of the prohibition against torture articulates the notion that the prohibition has now become one of the most fundamental standards of the international community. Furthermore, this prohibition is designed to produce a deterrent effect, in that it signals to all members of the international community and the individuals over whom they wield authority that the prohibition of torture is an absolute value from which nobody must deviate. 155. ... It would be senseless to argue, on the one hand, that on account of the jus cogens value of the prohibition against torture, treaties or customary rules providing for torture would be null and void ab initio, and then be unmindful of a State say, taking national measures authorising or condoning torture or absolving its perpetrators ... 156. Furthermore, at the individual level, that is, that of criminal liability, it would seem that one of the consequences of the jus cogens character bestowed by the international community upon the prohibition of torture is that every State is entitled to investigate, prosecute and punish or extradite individuals accused of torture, who are present in a territory under its jurisdiction. ...” Similar findings can be found in the judgments Prosecutor v. Mucić and Others (16 November 1998, IT-96-21-T, § 454) and Prosecutor v. Kunarac (22 February 2001, IT-96-23-T and IT-96-23/1, § 466).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
98,001-71412,ENG,POL,ADMISSIBILITY,2005,PACHLA v. POLAND,3,Inadmissible,Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant, Mr Zbigniew Pachla, is a Polish national who was born in 1953 and lives in Dobromierz. He is represented before the Court by Ms B. Słupska-Uczkiewicz, a lawyer practising in Wrocław. The respondent Government were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 26 August 1998 the applicant was arrested by the police. On 27 August 1998 the Świdnica District Court remanded him in custody on a charge of attempted extortion. On 23 November 1998 the applicant was released from detention. On 29 December 1998 the Świdnica District Prosecutor stayed the criminal proceedings against the applicant as his co-accused, a certain Mr J.J., had gone into hiding. On 11 June 1999 the prosecution service resumed the proceedings in order to prepare an extradition request in respect of J.J., who had been arrested in Belgium. On the same date the proceedings were stayed again. In August 2003 the bill of indictment was submitted to the Świdnica District Court. On 6 October 2003 the Świdnica District Court ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody for a period of three months. It found that the applicant had not collected the court’s summons and that he did not reside at the address indicated to the prosecution. In those circumstances a copy of the bill of indictment could not be served on the applicant and the hearing could not commence. Consequently, the District Court found that the applicant had obstructed the proceedings. On 21 October 2003 the applicant was arrested and placed in detention. On 24 October 2003 the applicant’s lawyer appealed against the detention order of 6 October 2003. On 30 October 2003 the Świdnica Regional Court quashed the impugned detention order. The applicant was released on the same day. It appears that the proceedings are pending before the Świdnica District Court. In August 1999 the applicant published the first issue of the “Information Bulletin of the Citizens’ Anticorruption Association OSA”. In the article entitled “The prosecutor’s son breaks the law” the applicant alleged that a prosecutor S.S. influenced the outcome of the criminal proceedings against his son, who had been involved in a traffic accident. On 9 August 1999 S.S. brought a private prosecution against the applicant, alleging that he had been defamed. He requested the Wałbrzych District Prosecutor to take over the prosecution, arguing that the public interest so required. On 26 August 1999 the Ząbkowice Śląskie District Prosecutor opened the investigation into the case. On 14 December 1999 the prosecutor lodged a bill of indictment with the Wałbrzych District Court. The applicant was indicted on the charge of defamation under Article 212 § 1 of the Criminal Code. In particular, the prosecutor alleged that in the bulletin the applicant imputed to S.S. “unlawful behaviour in order to lower him in public opinion and undermine public confidence in his capacity to perform the duties of a prosecutor”. On an unspecified date in 2000 the Wałbrzych District Court transmitted the case to the Świdnica District Court which had jurisdiction to hear it. On 19 January 2001 the Świdnica District Court convicted the applicant under Article 212 § 2 of the Criminal Code of defamation committed through the mass media. It sentenced him to ten months’ imprisonment suspended for three years. The applicant appealed against his conviction but his appeal was dismissed on 4 September 2001 by the Świdnica Regional Court. Article 14 provides as follows: “The Republic of Poland shall ensure freedom of the press and other means of social communication.” Article 31 § 3 of the Constitution, which lays down a general prohibition on disproportionate limitations on constitutional rights and freedoms (the principle of proportionality), provides: “Any limitation upon the exercise of constitutional freedoms and rights may be imposed only by statute, and only when necessary in a democratic State for the protection of its security or public order, or to protect the natural environment, health or public morals, or the freedoms and rights of other persons. Such limitations shall not violate the essence of freedoms and rights.” Article 54 § 1 of the Constitution guarantees freedom of expression. It states, in so far as relevant: “The freedom to express opinions, to acquire and to disseminate information shall be ensured to everyone.” Article 87 lists the sources of law. That provision reads, in so far as relevant, as follows: “1. The sources of the universally binding law of the Republic of Poland shall be: the Constitution, statutes, ratified international agreements, and regulations. ...” Article 91 of the Constitution, in its relevant part, states: “1. After promulgation thereof in the Journal of Laws of the Republic of Poland (Dziennik Ustaw), a ratified international agreement shall constitute part of the domestic legal order and shall be applied directly, unless its application depends on the enactment of a statute. 2. An international agreement ratified upon prior consent granted by statute shall have precedence over statutes if such an agreement cannot be reconciled with the provisions of such statutes.” Article 79 § 1 of the Constitution provides as follows: “In accordance with principles specified by statute, everyone whose constitutional freedoms or rights have been infringed, shall have the right to appeal to the Constitutional Court for a judgment on the conformity with the Constitution of a statute or another normative act on the basis of which a court or an administrative authority has issued a final decision on his freedoms or rights or on his obligations specified in the Constitution.” Article 190 of the Constitution, insofar as relevant provides as follows: “1. Judgments of the Constitutional Court shall be universally binding and final. 2. Judgments of the Constitutional Court, ... shall be published without delay. 3. A judgment of the Constitutional Court shall take effect from the day of its publication; however, the Constitutional Court may specify another date for the end of the binding force of a normative act. Such time-limit may not exceed 18 months in relation to a statute or 12 months in relation to any other normative act. ... 4. A judgment of the Constitutional Court on the non-conformity with the Constitution, an international agreement or statute, of a normative act on the basis of which a final and enforceable judicial decision or a final administrative decision ... was given, shall be a basis for re-opening of the proceedings, or for quashing the decision ... in a manner and on principles specified in provisions applicable to the given proceedings.” Article 212 §§ 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code 1997 provides as follows: “§ 1. Anyone who imputes to another person, a group of persons, an institution, a legal person or an organisation without legal personality, such behaviour or characteristics, as may lower this person, group or entity in the public opinion or undermine public confidence in their capacity necessary for a certain position, occupation or type of activity, shall be liable to a fine, a restriction of liberty or imprisonment not exceeding 1 year. § 2. If the perpetrator commits the act described in paragraph 1 through a means of mass communication, he shall be liable to a fine, restriction of liberty or imprisonment not exceeding 2 years.” In 2005 a constitutional complaint was lodged with the Constitutional Court against Articles 212 § 2 and 213 § 2 of the Criminal Code. A claimant in that case, who had been convicted on the basis of these provisions, alleged that they were incompatible with Article 54 of the Constitution read in conjunction with Article 31 § 3 and Article 14 of the Constitution. The case was registered under no. SK 43/05 and currently the proceedings on the merits of that complaint are pending. Article 521 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides as follows: “The Prosecutor General or the Ombudsman may lodge a cassation appeal against any final and enforceable judicial decision.” Article 523 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure stipulates that a defendant may not lodge a cassation appeal in cases where a suspended prison sentence has been imposed. Article 540 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1997 provides for reopening of the proceedings following a judgment of the Constitutional Court. It provides as follows: “The proceedings shall be reopened to the benefit of the accused when as a result of the Constitutional Court’s judgment a provision of law which served as the basis for conviction or conditional discontinuation [of the proceedings] was abolished or amended.” On 17 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”) entered into force. It lays down various legal means designed to counteract and/or redress the undue length of judicial proceedings. A party to pending proceedings may ask for the acceleration of those proceedings and/or just satisfaction for their unreasonable length under section 2 read in conjunction with section 5(1) of the 2004 Act. Section 2, in so far as relevant, reads as follows: Section 5 provides, in so far as relevant: “1. A complaint about the unreasonable length of proceedings shall be lodged while the proceedings are pending. ...” Section 16 refers to proceedings that have been terminated and that do not fall under the transitional provision of section 18 (see paragraph 46 below) in the following terms: “A party who has not lodged a complaint about the unreasonable length of the proceedings under section 5 (1) may claim – under Article 417 of the Civil Code ... – compensation for the damage which resulted from the unreasonable length of the proceedings after the proceedings concerning the merits of the case have ended. Article 442 of the Civil Code sets out limitation periods in respect of various claims based on tort. That provision applies to situations covered by Article 417 of the Civil Code. Article 442, in so far as relevant, reads: “1. A claim for compensation for damage caused by a tort shall lapse 3 years following the date on which the claimant learned of the damage and the persons liable for it. However, the claim shall in any case lapse 10 years following the date on which the event causing the damage had occurred.” Section 18 of the 2004 Act lays down the following transitional rules in relation to the applications already pending before the Court: “1. Within six months after the date of entry into force of this law persons who, before that date, had lodged a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights ... complaining of a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time guaranteed by Article 6 (1) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ..., may lodge a complaint about the unreasonable length of the proceedings on the basis of the provisions of this law if their complaint to the Court had been lodged in the course of the impugned proceedings and if the Court has not adopted a decision concerning the admissibility of their case. 2. A complaint lodged under subsection 1 shall indicate the date on which the application was lodged with the Court. 3. The relevant court shall immediately inform the Minister of Foreign Affairs of any complaints lodged under subsection 1.” On 18 January 2005 the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) adopted a resolution (no. III SPP 113/04) in which it ruled that while the 2004 Act produced legal effects as from the date of its date of entry into force (17 September 2004), its provisions applied retroactively to all proceedings in which delays had occurred before that date and had not yet been remedied.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
99,001-122743,ENG,SWE,ADMISSIBILITY,2013,MURADI AND ALIEVA v. SWEDEN,4,Inadmissible,Aleš Pejchal;André Potocki;Ann Power-Forde;Ganna Yudkivska;Helena Jäderblom;Mark Villiger;Paul Lemmens,"1. The first applicant, Ms Selma Alieva, is an Azerbaijani national who was born in 1989. The second applicant, Mr Ali Muradi, is an Afghan national who was born in 1982. They are both currently in Sweden. They are represented by Ms I. Andersen from Virserum. 2 3. The first applicant applied for asylum and a residence permit in Sweden on 10 October 2011. Before the Migration Board (Migrationsverket) she stated the following. She had lived in an orphanage until she was five, after which a couple had taken care of her. Her stepmother had passed away when she was seven years old. Her stepfather had been very cruel and harsh; he had beaten and battered her. Furthermore, he had begun to abuse her sexually when she was 12 years old. A Kurdish man used to visit them when she was approximately 16 years old. She had had the impression that he wanted to marry her. Subsequently, she and her stepfather had travelled with the Kurdish man to Turkey. The morning after their arrival there her stepfather had disappeared. Following this, the Kurdish man had abused her sexually and had left her at a hotel where she had been forced into prostitution. This had continued for approximately five years until she had been able to flee to Sweden. She had no male relatives who could protect her in Azerbaijan. She did not want to have any contact with her stepfather. 4. On 28 December 2011 the Migration Board rejected the request. It first stated that, although the first applicant had not submitted any documents to substantiate her identity or asylum story, she had made it credible that she was an Azerbaijani national. The Board then observed that, according to country information, it had become easier for women in Baku to participate in society and to work over the last few years. Moreover, the Board found it possible for the first applicant to reside in Baku without having any contact with her stepfather. Furthermore, the Board noted that she had not sought protection from the domestic authorities in Azerbaijan as regards the violence and abuse by her stepfather. She had not substantiated that the domestic authorities would not be able or willing to protect her upon return. In conclusion, the Board found that the first applicant had not shown that she was in need of protection in Sweden. 5. The first applicant appealed to the Migration Court (Migrationsdomstolen), maintaining her claims and adding the following. She feared that, if returned to Azerbaijan, she would again be a victim of trafficking and be forced into prostitution. Those who had forced her into prostitution were still looking for her. Due to the fact that she had no contacts in Azerbaijan, no education and no assets, it would be impossible for her to manage on her own there. 6. On 28 May 2012 the Migration Court rejected the appeal. It first observed that, according to country information, trafficking and prostitution were big problems in Azerbaijan. However, the court considered that the general situation for young women in the country was not a ground for protection per se. Moreover, the court noted that the stepfather had abused the first applicant when she was a child and that it had not emerged that she had been forced into prostitution in Azerbaijan. Underlining that she was now an adult woman, the court found that there was nothing to suggest that she would risk abuse by her stepfather upon return. As regards her claim that those who had forced her into prostitution in Turkey were still looking for her, the court noted that this had been stated for the first time in the appeal to the court and that she had not presented any concrete information or explanation as to how she had found out about this. 7. It appears that the first applicant did not appeal to the Migration Court of Appeal (Migrationsöverdomstolen). 8. The second applicant applied for asylum and a residence permit in Sweden on 5 October 2011. Before the Migration Board he stated the following. He was Hazara and came from the province of Ghazni, Afghanistan. His family had recently moved to Pakistan. The Taliban had visited his family’s house in Afghanistan and had told him and his father to cooperate or be killed. They had replied that they would think about it. Subsequently, the Taliban had come looking for him on two occasions. Because of this, his father had wanted him to flee and, in 2008, he had travelled to Iran. In 2009 his father had been killed. The second applicant thought that this was an act by the Taliban, since his father did not have any other enemies. He could not return to Afghanistan because there were Taliban everywhere in the country. Furthermore, it would be difficult for him to find an occupation in another part of the country. 9. On 4 January 2012 the Migration Board rejected the request. It first noted that the second applicant had submitted a tazkira but considered that it did not make his identity credible. However, the Board found it credible that he came from the province of Ghazni. Turning to his individual claims, the Board considered that the asylum story was brief and that it concerned alleged events which had occurred in the relatively distant past. The Board found it unlikely that those who had wanted to recruit him three years earlier would still be interested in him upon return. As regards the general situation in Ghazni the Board noted that, according to country information, there was an internal armed conflict in the province. In the light of this, the Board found it unreasonable for him to return there. However, it considered that it was possible and reasonable for him to return to Kabul, finding, inter alia, that the security situation was better there and that the second applicant was a young, healthy man capable of working. 10. The second applicant appealed to the Migration Court, maintaining his claims and adding that the Taliban who had killed his father would find him even if he moved to Kabul. The second applicant submitted, inter alia, a document which was allegedly a warrant for his arrest, issued by the Taliban. 11. On 29 May 2012 the Migration Court rejected the appeal. The court found that the second applicant’s story did not raise any questions as to his home province and thus decided to examine the appeal on the basis, in the first place, of a return to Ghazni. Turning to the general situation in the province, the court agreed with the Board that there was an internal armed conflict and that the second applicant therefore could not return to Ghazni. However, it considered that, although the security situation in Kabul was volatile, the second applicant was a healthy young man who should be able to settle there despite the generally serious situation. As to the second applicant’s asylum story, the court considered that it related to events in Ghazni which had occurred in the relatively distant past. In the court’s view, the fact that there were Taliban in Kabul did not automatically entail a personal threat against the applicant there. Furthermore, the court had doubts about the alleged arrest warrant submitted, noting that the document contained stamps in English, which the court found difficult to associate with official Taliban documents. As there were no other grounds to grant the second applicant leave to remain in Sweden, it rejected the appeal. 12. On 5 October 2012 the Migration Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal. 13. In October 2012 the applicants requested the Migration Board to reconsider its previous decisions due to new circumstances. They stated that they had met and established a relationship and that the first applicant was pregnant. It was imperative, for the sake of their child, that they be allowed to stay in Sweden. The first applicant would not be able to go to Afghanistan because of the security situation there. Moreover, she had no network in Azerbaijan to support her or her child. The second applicant suffered from depression and claimed that if he were separated from his partner and their future child, there was a risk that his health would deteriorate seriously. Furthermore, he alleged that he had converted to Christianity in Sweden and that it would be very dangerous for him to return to Afghanistan. He could not go to Azerbaijan for several reasons: he would not be able to find work there and the state did not accept or provide any assistance to refugees. The applicants submitted, inter alia, the second applicant’s baptism certificate dated 9 April 2012, which stated that he had confessed faith in the Gospel and its teachings. 14. On 1 November 2012 the Migration Board found that no such new circumstances had been presented which could justify granting residence permits to the applicants. It first noted that the applicants had been in Sweden for a relatively short period of time and considered that they did not have a strong connection to Sweden. The Board also noted that the applicants had not submitted any medical certificates substantiating that the second applicant had a serious health condition. Furthermore, the Board observed that the applicants’ family situation had emerged after the decisions to send them back to their native countries, when they had both been well aware that the future of their family life in Sweden was highly uncertain. In its view, the difficulties of maintaining family life under such circumstances did not constitute a reason to grant them residence permits. As regards the second applicant’s conversion, the Board considered that the fact that he had converted after the Board’s decision to return him to Afghanistan suggested that his conversion was not authentic and genuine. The baptism certificate submitted did not change the Board’s view in this regard. The Board further noted that the second applicant had submitted no information about why he had converted or regarding other circumstances concerning the conversion. 15. The applicants appealed to the Migration Court, maintaining their claims and adding the following. The second applicant had now been a practising Christian for about a year and he had been baptised seven months earlier. His faith was genuine. The Migration Board had not properly investigated his conversion and the case should therefore be remitted to the Board. If returned to Afghanistan, he would risk serious punishment. The applicants had been living together since April 2012 and were expecting their first child in April 2013. In the light of this, they should be granted residence permits in Sweden since there was no other country in which they could live together. 16. On 3 December 2012 the Migration Court rejected the appeal as concerned the second applicant’s conversion and dismissed the remainder of the appeal as the Migration Board’s decision in that part was final. As concerned the conversion, the court found that the second applicant’s story was general in nature and that it did not describe the considerations and thoughts which had led to his conversion. 17. The applicants appealed to the Migration Court of Appeal which, on 4 January 2013, refused leave to appeal. 18. Subsequently, the applicants submitted a copy of a medical record concerning both of them. The Migration Board considered this as a request for reconsideration of their case. 19. On 6 December 2012 the Migration Board once again found that no such new circumstances had been presented that could lead to the granting of residence permits. It noted that, according to the medical record, the second applicant had claimed that he was suffering from psychological problems and difficulties sleeping. However, the Board found that no medical certificate had been submitted showing any need for medical care and that these problems did not constitute grounds to stay the expulsion orders. 20. On 13 February 2013 the applicants lodged their application with the Court and requested it to apply Rule 39 of the Rules of the Court in order to stop the enforcement of their expulsion. They stated the following. The second applicant risked being punished or killed due to the fact that he had converted to Christianity. He had been wanted by the Taliban before he fled from Afghanistan. Furthermore, the applicants wanted to live together as a family and the second applicant wanted to raise his future son as a Christian. A removal to their native countries would mean the end of their lives. 21. In support of their claims the applicants submitted, inter alia, the following: A copy of a certificate regarding the second applicant, dated 27 December 2012, in which a pastor stated that the second applicant was a member of his congregation. A copy of a medical certificate dated 2 January 2013, in which a chief physician at a psychiatric clinic stated that the applicants were being treated at the clinic. As regards the first applicant, she was suffering from a severe form of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) called DESNOS (disorder of extreme stress, not otherwise specified). Everyday situations reminded her of traumatic experiences in the past. She was anxiety-ridden but not deeply depressed. As regards the second applicant, he was anxious about their difficult situation. An undated copy of a letter, allegedly written by the second applicant, in which he described Christianity as a religion of peace and love and Islam as a religion of the opposite. 22. On 26 February 2013 the Acting President of the Section decided to grant priority to the above application and to ask the Swedish Government for factual information regarding, inter alia, the possibility to send the second applicant to Azerbaijan and the presence of organisations in Azerbaijan which provide shelters for women seeking protection. 23. In their response, dated 13 March 2013, the Government submitted that, according to Chapter 12, section 4, paragraph 3, of the Aliens Act (Utlänningslagen, 2005:716), an alien who is to be refused entry or expelled may always be sent to a country where the alien shows that he or she can be received. This rule is complementary to the provisions that otherwise apply and can only serve as a basis for expulsion to a country to which the alien wants to go (travaux préparatoires, 2003/04:50, p.77). In the light of this, the Government considered that it was possible to send the second applicant to Azerbaijan together with the first applicant, if he agreed to this and showed that he could be received there. Moreover, if he was to leave Sweden voluntarily, as he was supposed to, he could travel to any country of his choosing. 24. As regards the formalities and requirements which must be observed and complied with in order to send the second applicant to Azerbaijan, the Government stated the following. The Migration Board had clarified that in order for the migration authorities to send an alien to a country other than specified in the expulsion order, the alien was normally required to have a residence permit for the country to which he or she wished to travel. Moreover, it should not be substantially more expensive or result in delay to expel the alien to another country than the one specified in the decision. The Government had consulted the relevant and accessible Azerbaijani legislation and drawn the conclusion that it was possible for a relative or a spouse of an Azerbaijani citizen to be granted a residence permit in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan had an embassy in Stockholm where the applicants should be able to obtain further information and submit an application. It should also be possible for the second applicant to acquire an Azerbaijani visa. It appeared that he could then travel to Azerbaijan and apply for a residence permit there. This could be an option, as long as the applicants made the travel arrangements themselves. 25. Furthermore, the Government noted that in order to apply for an Azerbaijani visa or residence permit, the second applicant had to have a passport. If the second applicant did not have a passport, he should be able to acquire one at an Afghan embassy, for example at the embassy in Oslo. According to information from the Norwegian migration authorities, the Afghan embassy in Oslo normally granted passports to applicants who had a tazkira. As regards the first applicant, she should be able to apply for a passport or other identity documents at the Azerbaijani embassy in Stockholm. 26. As regards the presence of various organisations in Azerbaijan, and in Baku in particular, which provide shelters for women seeking protection, the Government had consulted a number of reports relating to the situation for women in Azerbaijan. The reports mentioned, inter alia, a few government-operated centres for victims of trafficking and two shelters for women in the Baku area that were run by non-governmental organisations. 27. In their response, dated 26 March 2013, the applicants submitted that it was not a good option, from a humanitarian point of view, to send them to Azerbaijan. The first applicant had had a tragic childhood there. Furthermore, both applicants suffered from psychiatric problems and both had been hospitalised in Sweden for a considerable time. Their child would be born very soon. 28. The applicants’ son was born on 12 April 2013. 29. The basic provisions mainly applicable in the present case, concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in Sweden, are laid down in the Aliens Act, as amended on 1 January 2010. 30. Chapter 5, section 1, of the Aliens Act stipulates than an alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is, with certain exceptions, entitled to a residence permit in Sweden. According to Chapter 4, section 1, of the Aliens Act, the term “refugee” refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race, nationality, religious or political beliefs, or on grounds of gender, sexual orientation or other membership of a particular social group and who is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country. This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities cannot be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals. By “an alien otherwise in need of protection” is meant, inter alia, a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well-founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment, or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Chapter 4, section 2, of the Aliens Act). 31. Moreover, if a residence permit cannot be granted on the above grounds, such a permit may be issued to an alien if, after an overall assessment of his or her situation, there are such particularly distressing circumstances (synnerligen ömmande omständigheter) to allow him or her to remain in Sweden (Chapter 5, section 6, of the Aliens Act). 32. As regards the enforcement of a deportation or expulsion order, account has to be taken of the risk of capital punishment or torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement, an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Chapter 12, section 1, of the Aliens Act). In addition, an alien must not, in principle, be sent to a country where he or she risks persecution (Chapter 12, section 2, of the Aliens Act). 33. Under certain conditions, an alien may be granted a residence permit even if a deportation or expulsion order has gained legal force. This applies, under Chapter 12, section 18, of the Aliens Act, where new circumstances have emerged that mean there are reasonable grounds for believing, inter alia, that enforcement would put the alien in danger of being subjected to capital or corporal punishment, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or there are medical or other special reasons why the order should not be enforced. 34. If a residence permit cannot be granted under Chapter 12, section 18, of the Aliens Act, the Migration Board may instead decide to re-examine the matter. Such a re-examination shall be carried out where it may be assumed, on the basis of new circumstances invoked by the alien, that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in Chapter 12, sections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, and these circumstances could not have been invoked previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not doing so. Should the applicable conditions not have been met, the Migration Board shall decide not to grant a reexamination (Chapter 12, section 19, of the Aliens Act). 35. Under the Aliens Act, matters concerning the right of aliens to enter and remain in Sweden are dealt with by three instances: the Migration Board, the Migration Court and the Migration Court of Appeal (Chapter 14, section 3, and Chapter 16, section 9, of the Aliens Act). However, no appeal lies against a decision by the Migration Board not to grant a residence permit under Chapter 12, section 18, of the Aliens Act (Chapter 14 of the Aliens Act, a contrario).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

On 19 April 1995 the applicant, who was born in 1939 and lives in Ventspils, was arrested by the Jelgava police and remanded in custody until 13 June 1995. During this period of time some of the applicant’s property stored in her house in Jelgava, where a café belonging to her was also located, and in her second house in Dobele, was stolen. Criminal proceedings were initiated in this connection. 7. On 23 May 1995 criminal proceedings in case no. 22546495 were initiated regarding the burglary in Jelgava. 8. On 25 May 1995 the Jelgava police decided to acknowledge the applicant as a civil claimant in criminal case no. 22546495, with a claim for 763 Latvian lati (LVL) (approximately EUR 1,090). 9. On 11 July 1995 another set of criminal proceedings, allocated case number no. 22564195, was initiated regarding the burglary in Jelgava. On the same date the Jelgava police decided to acknowledge the applicant as a civil claimant in criminal case no. 22564195, with a claim for LVL 6725.60 (approximately EUR 9,607). According to a copy of that decision, submitted by the applicant, the police investigator crossed out the above amount, putting LVL 12,103 (approximately EUR 17,290) instead. The applicant requested to be acknowledged as a civil claimant with a claim for that amount when she was questioned on 11 September 1995. 10. On 28 February 1997 the Jelgava police joined the two sets of criminal proceedings into one case, no. 22564195. 11. On 17 September 1997 a public prosecutor attached to the Zemgale District Court (“the Zemgale public prosecutor”) informed the applicant that, following her complaint to the Prosecutor General’s Office, an examination of the investigation in the criminal proceedings relating to the burglary of her property had been carried out. During the examination, serious infringements of the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code had been detected. In that regard, according to the Zemgale public prosecutor, she had on 27 January 1997 requested the head of the Jelgava police to rectify the deficiencies indicated to him and to identify the police officers who had failed to protect the applicant’s property upon her detention, as required by Article 80 of the Criminal Procedure Code. An official investigation had been carried out into the failure to protect the applicant’s property and the criminal proceedings in respect of the burglary of the property. As a result, two police officers had been identified as responsible for the failure to protect the applicant’s property. One of them had been disciplined and the other’s professional conduct had been assessed by the professional attestation commission. 12. On 20 August 2000 the applicant wrote to the Zemgale public prosecutor, inquiring about the progress in the criminal proceedings. 13. On 26 September 2000 the Zemgale public prosecutor informed the applicant that her complaint in respect of lack of progress in the criminal proceedings was well-founded, since the Jelgava police had not carried out any investigative measures and the investigation in the criminal proceedings had been unlawfully delayed. According to the prosecutor, the head of the police at the Ministry of the Interior had been informed thereof on 25 September 2000. 14. On 20 January 2001 the applicant complained to the Prosecutor General about the inefficiency of the Zemgale public prosecutor, which had hindered the restitution of her stolen property. On 5 February 2001 the Prosecutor General informed the applicant that her complaint had been transferred to the Zemgale public prosecutor for examination. 15. On 13 February 2001, the Zemgale public prosecutor informed the applicant that the investigation in the criminal proceedings in case no. 22564195 was still in progress. She had requested the head of the Jelgava police to speed up the investigation and to carry out the instructions she had given the Jelgava police on 27 January 1997 by 25 February 2001. Thereafter, an additional examination of the conduct of the investigation was to be carried out. 16. On 12 May 2001 the applicant complained to the Prosecutor General about the lack of progress in the investigation in the criminal proceedings. 17. On 20 June 2001 the Zemgale public prosecutor confirmed that the applicant had been declared a civil claimant in the criminal proceedings in case no. 22564195, which were still ongoing. 18. On 19 July 2001 the Prosecutor General informed the applicant that her application of 12 May 2001 had been transferred for examination to the Zemgale public prosecutor on 21 May 2001. 19. On 23 July 2001 the Zemgale public prosecutor sent the applicant the decision of 20 June 2001, without answering in substance the applicant’s questions about the progress in the criminal proceedings. 20. On 24 July 2001 the Zemgale public prosecutor informed the applicant that both decisions declaring her a civil claimant had been sent to her. 21. On 11 December 2001 the Jelgava police, pursuant to Article 139 § 5 of the Criminal Code, decided to acknowledge the applicant as a civil claimant in criminal proceedings no. 22564195, with a claim for LVL 32,789.10 (approximately EUR 46,840). 22. On 5 May 2005 the applicant wrote to the Zemgale public prosecutor, inquiring about the progress in the criminal proceedings. 23. On 13 May 2005 the Zemgale public prosecutor informed the applicant that her inquiries concerning criminal proceedings no. 22564195 had been transferred to the Jelgava City public prosecutor, and those concerning criminal proceedings nos. 20517495 and 2503000802 (paragraph 33, below) to the Dobele District public prosecutor. 24. On 7 June 2005 the Jelgava City public prosecutor informed the applicant that criminal proceedings no. 22564195 were still ongoing. The Jelgava Police Department had been instructed to speed up the investigation. 25. On 30 June 2005 a police officer of the Jelgava police decided to transfer the criminal case to the public prosecutor of the City of Jelgava for prosecution. It had been established by the pre-trial investigation that between 19 April and 13 June 1995, during the applicant’s detention, R.Z., E.R., V.I. and I.B. had stolen and consumed food and alcoholic beverages, and stolen money, clothes, kitchen equipment and other items, which amounted to a total loss of LVL 32,798.10 (approximately EUR 46,841) to the applicant. R.Z., E.R., V.I. and I.B. had thus committed a crime under Article 139 § 5 of the Criminal Code. This decision was sent to the applicant on 1 July 2005. 26. On 8 July 2005 a prosecutor of the Prosecutor’s Office of the City of Jelgava brought a charge against I.B. for burglary in the amount of LVL 2,642 (approximately EUR 3,774). A preventive measure – prohibition on changing her place of residence – was imposed on her. 27. On 17 August 2005 a prosecutor of the Prosecutor’s Office of the City of Jelgava brought a charge against E.R. for burglary in the amount of LVL 2,622 (approximately EUR 3,746). 28. On 8 September 2005 a prosecutor of the Prosecutor’s Office of the City of Jelgava decided to terminate the criminal proceedings in case no. 22564195 because of a lack of sufficient evidence. It was stated, inter alia, that since during questioning the applicant had constantly increased the amount of the loss she had allegedly suffered, her statements in this respect should be treated with caution. It was established that during questioning I.B., E.R., R.Z. and V.I. had denied having burgled the applicant’s property and that it was impossible, on the basis of an assessment of the evidence, to discover what had been stolen from the applicant’s property, and in what circumstances. Besides, since the instigation of the criminal proceedings in 1995 no evidence had been obtained as to the persons responsible for the loss or theft of the applicant’s property. The prosecutor considered that the case should be terminated on the grounds that it was impossible to obtain further evidence and to prove any charges against named individuals. According to the information provided by the Government, the decision was sent to the applicant on 14 September 2005, and she was informed that it could be appealed against to the Zemgale Regional Public Prosecutor’s Office. The applicant contested that claim, stating that she had not received the decision. 29. On 28 June 1995 the Dobele police instituted criminal proceedings in case no. 20517495 in respect of the burglary of the applicant’s house in Dobele. 30. On 8 August 1995 the Dobele police acknowledged the applicant as a civil claimant for an amount of LVL 9,439 (approximately EUR 13,484). 31. On 28 February 1996 a public prosecutor of the Dobele District decided to terminate the criminal proceedings in part and to reject the applicant’s civil claim in part. It was established that the accused E.R. had confessed to having stolen a few of the items declared by the applicant as stolen and was thus liable for the amount of LVL 1,005 (approximately EUR 1,436). Taking into account that the applicant could not give details of all the stolen items and their value, the prosecutor decided that the loss suffered by her should be considered approximate and, pursuant to Article 208 § 2 of the Criminal Procedure Code, decided to terminate the criminal case against E.R. in part because of the lack of evidence and to reject the applicant’s civil claim in the amount of LVL 8,434 (approximately EUR 12,049) as unsubstantiated. 32. On 16 December 1996 a public prosecutor of the Dobele District decided to terminate the remainder of the criminal proceedings. She established that during the pre-trial investigation no evidence had been obtained to justify charging I.B. with the burglary. As to E.R., considering that he was serving a sentence imposed on him in another set of criminal proceedings on 25 November 1996, and was thus unable to commit new offences, the prosecutor decided to terminate the criminal proceedings against him in the remaining part. 33. On 10 December 2002 the head of the Zemgale Region Public Prosecutor’s Office quashed the decision of the public prosecutor of the Dobele District to reject the applicant’s civil claim in the amount of LVL 8,434 (approximately EUR 12,049) as unsubstantiated. The head prosecutor instructed that, at the pre-trial stage, it had to be checked whether the burglary could have been carried out by another person, and that the applicant herself should be questioned in detail as regards the allegedly stolen items, their description and value. The prosecutor ordered the initiation of a new criminal case, no. 2503000802, in respect of the theft of the applicant’s property in the amount of LVL 8,434 (approximately EUR 12,049). 34. On 31 May 2005 the Dobele District public prosecutor informed the applicant that criminal proceedings no. 20517495 had been terminated on 16 December 1996, pursuant to Article 208 § 4 of the Criminal Procedure Code; criminal proceedings no. 2503000802 (concerning the stolen property in the amount of LVL 8,434 (approximately EUR 12,049)) were still ongoing at the Dobele Police Department, and the perpetrator had not been identified. 35. According to a letter of the Prosecutor’s Office of the Dobele District, criminal case no. 2503000802 was transferred to the Dobele District police for pre-trial investigation on 7 January 2003. The prosecutor responsible for the supervision of the investigation examined the case on 1 July 2005. 36. According to the submissions of the Government, the investigation of the criminal case is still ongoing. 37. On 10 June 2001 the applicant filed a civil claim for damages against the State Police Authorities with the Rīga Regional Court, and asked to be exempted from court taxes because of her poor financial situation. According to the documents she submitted to the Court, she attached a copy of her pensioner’s certificate of 15 May 1996, stating that she received an old-age pension in the amount of LVL 35.91 (approximately EUR 50), and the replies of the Zemgale public prosecutor of 13 February 2001, 26 September 2000 and 17 September 1997 to her complaints. She requested the court to award her compensation in the amount of LVL 250,000 (approximately EUR 357,143) for her stolen property and for the non-pecuniary damage she had suffered because the Jelgava police had acted contrary to the requirements of Article 80 of the Criminal Procedure Code. 38. On 14 June 2001 a judge of the Civil Chamber of the Rīga Regional Court informed the applicant that she had requested exemption from paying court taxes without submitting any evidence that she was financially unable to do so. The judge further noted that she had not submitted any documents confirming the circumstances on which her claim was based. The judge set a deadline of 23 July 2001 for rectification of those deficiencies. 39. On 27 June 2001 the applicant amended her claim, stating that because the police had acted contrary to the requirements of Article 80 of the Criminal Procedure Code her rights guaranteed by Article 13 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention had been violated. She again requested exemption from court taxes, attaching a copy of her pensioner’s certificate and copies of the replies of the Zemgale public prosecutor of 26 September 2000 and 17 September 1997 to substantiate the claim. 40. On 29 June 2001 the judge of the Rīga Regional Court replied to the applicant that her amendments of 27 June 2001 were insufficient and that she should rectify the deficiencies by 23 July 2001. 41. On 15 July 2001 the applicant amended her claim by submitting a copy of the decision of the Jelgava police of 11 July 1995, which acknowledged her as a civil claimant and stated that in order to assess the value of the remainder of the stolen property she was to invite witnesses to give evidence. 42. On 13 August 2001 the judge of the Rīga Regional Court considered that the deficiencies indicated by him had not been rectified and, finding that the claim had not been properly submitted, returned it to the applicant without examination. 43. On 4 October 2001 the Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court, in response to the applicant’s ancillary complaint of 21 August 2001, upheld the decision of the Rīga Regional Court. The court considered that the applicant had failed to submit evidence as to her financial situation and to attach documents establishing the circumstances her claim was based on. The decision was final and not subject to appeal. 1. The Criminal Procedure Code (Latvijas Kriminālprocesa Kodekss), as in force until 1 October 2005 44. Article 80 stated that “if an arrested person had property or an apartment which was left unattended, the police, a public prosecutor or a court had to ensure its protection”. 45. Article 101 stipulated that a civil claim could be submitted by a person who had suffered damage as a result of a crime. The civil claim could be brought against the accused or a person who was vicariously liable for the acts of the accused (paragraph 1). The civil claim could be lodged upon initiation of a criminal case, during the pre-trial investigation, or with the court before the adjudication of the case (paragraph 2). If the court stayed the adjudication, the civil claim could also be lodged before the beginning of the adjudication at the subsequent court hearing (paragraph 3). A person had the right to lodge a civil claim by way of civil proceedings if the claim had not been brought in criminal proceedings or if the claim was not adjudicated due to the termination of the criminal case or a not guilty verdict (paragraph 7). 46. Pursuant to Article 102, a person who had suffered pecuniary damage as a result of a criminal offence could bring a civil claim against an accused or a person who was vicariously liable for the acts of the accused, which would be examined by a court in conjunction with the criminal case. Further, a person who had been acknowledged as a civil claimant by a decision of the police, a public prosecutor or a court was entitled to submit a complaint in respect of acts of the aforementioned authorities. 47. Article 140 provided that a person who had suffered damage as a result of a crime could be declared a civil party during the pre-trial investigation. 48. Pursuant to Article 208 §§ 2 and 4, a criminal case or a part of it was to be terminated if a charge had not been proved and it was impossible to obtain additional evidence, and if it had been acknowledged, because of changed circumstances during the investigation of the case, that an offence committed by a person had lost its element of public danger or that that person no longer posed a danger to the public. 49. A civil claimant could submit a complaint about acts of the police to a public prosecutor. The complaint could be submitted to the prosecutor directly or through the intermediary of the person against whom the complaint was brought. A complaint submitted to a police officer had to be forwarded together with his explanations to the prosecutor within twenty-four hours (Article 220). The prosecutor had to decide on the complaint within three days from its receipt and notify the complainant of the outcome. If the complaint was rejected, reasons therefore had to be stated. Decisions and acts of a public prosecutor could be appealed against to a higher prosecutor, who had to deal with that appeal in accordance with the aforementioned procedures (Articles 221 and 222). 50. Pursuant to Article 308, if a civil claim had been left without examination upon adjudication of a criminal case, it could be lodged de novo within civil proceedings. 51. Article 139 § 5 stated that aggravated robbery carried a sentence of imprisonment of from six to fifteen years, with confiscation of property. 52. According to Article 7 § 1, civil claims for compensation for pecuniary or non-pecuniary damage in criminal matters may be brought in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the criminal procedure law. 53. Article 96 § 3 states that a judgment in criminal proceedings is binding in civil proceedings to the extent that it concerns the determination of the offence for which a defendant has been sentenced, and the liability of the defendant. 54. The court shall stay court proceedings if adjudication of the case is not possible prior to the deciding of another matter which is required to be adjudicated in accordance with criminal procedure (the relevant part of Article 214). 55. Article 1635 stipulates that every wrongful act or failure to act per se shall give the person who has suffered damage the right to claim compensation from the wrongdoer, insofar as he or she may be held liable for such act or failure. 56. Everyone has a duty to compensate for losses he has caused through his acts or failure to act (Article 1779). A loss shall be understood to mean any deprivation which can be assessed financially (Article 1770). Losses may be either losses that have already been incurred, or losses that are expected to be incurred; they give rise to a right to compensation (Article 1771). A loss which has already been incurred may be a diminution of the value of the victim’s existing property or a decrease in his or her anticipated profits (Article 1772). 57. Every person has the right to defend his rights and lawful interests in a court and, in the event of unlawful interference with his rights, everyone has the right to adequate compensation (Article 92).",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant, Mr Celalettin Yöyler, is a Turkish citizen who was born in 1941 and is at present living in Istanbul (Turkey). Until June 1994 the applicant lived in the village of Dirimpınar, attached to the Malazgirt district in the province of Muş. Between 1966 and 1994 the applicant was the imam (religious leader) of the village. As a result of his involvement with a number of political organisations, including the Social Democratic Populist Party (SHP), the People's Labour Party (HEP) and the Democracy Party (DEP), of which he became the local leader, he was imprisoned on a number of occasions. The applicant left and had never returned to his village prior to the alleged events in question, since he had been threatened with death. The application concerns the applicant's allegations that State security forces destroyed his house. 10. The facts surrounding the destruction of the applicant's house are in dispute between the parties. 11. In 1994 three young women from the village, all of whom were related to the applicant's extended family, decided to join the PKK. 12. On 15 September 1994 the gendarme unit commander of Malazgirt came to the village and threatened to burn the village to the ground if the women were not brought to him within three days. 13. The applicant's family and the families of the young women, frightened by this threat, loaded up their possessions and fled. However, the gendarmes, accompanied by special teams, forced them to return to the village and to unload their possessions. They gathered the families into a house by force, where they assaulted certain of them, including the applicant's wife. They withdrew from the village telling the villagers to take good photographs of their houses, as that was all they would have to remember them by. 14. On 18 September 1994, at 8 p.m., special gendarme teams and village guards came to the village. Villagers were ordered to go into their homes and to turn off their lamps. The security forces then took diesel oil from the villagers' tractors and barrels and set fire to the houses of the applicant and his family. The applicant was out of the village, in İzmir, when his house was burned down. 15. On 23 September 1994 the applicant filed a criminal complaint with the Karşıyaka public prosecutor in İzmir for submission to the Malazgirt public prosecutor, calling for an on-site investigation and the institution of proceedings against the perpetrators. This document was registered as no. 35798 by the Karşıyaka public prosecutor's office. 16. On 24 September 1994 the applicant made a press statement through a human rights body, the Human Rights Association, which was carried the same day in the pro-Kurdish newspaper Özgür Ülke. 17. On 8 November 1994 the public prosecutor (no. 31583) sent a letter to the Gendarme Command in Malazgirt requesting a report on the matters raised in the applicant's allegations. He repeated his request in letters of 8 December 1994 (no. 30965) and 2 February 1995 (no. 31583). 18. By letter of 2 March 1995, the Gendarme Central Command in Malazgirt replied to the prosecutor's letter of 8 December 1994 by submitting the records of the statements they had taken. The prosecutor took further statements in May 1995, and the gendarme commander M.A. in June and November 1995. Since November 1995, there has been no development in the investigation. 19. The applicant left the village of Dirimpinar of his own free will, together with his spouse and children. He settled first in Adapazarı and then in Istanbul or Izmir. The Government submitted various records of the statements taken by the authorities in relation to the burning of the applicant's house. 20. Mr Muhsettin Yöyler, the mayor (muhtar) of the village of Dirimpinar, stated to the public prosecutor that on the night of the incident, he had seen some persons setting fire to the applicant's house but as they had their faces covered, he had not been able to recognise them. He did, however, recognise one of them, Ahmet (A.K.), a village guard from the village of Nurettin. The statement by the applicant's fellow villager, Mr Abdulcebbar Sezen, revealed that the applicant had not been in the village during the incident, but that his family had been. 21. Mr Muhsettin Yöyler claimed that although he had seen the applicant's house burning, he had not seen who had set fire to it, as it was dark. Mr Süleyman Yılmaz and Mr Ömer Sezen from the same village made identical statements. 22. Mr Aydın Sezen declared before the same gendarme commander that the applicant had always acted in a subversive manner towards the State, that his house had indeed been burned, that he had not seen who had set fire to it, but it had definitely not been the security forces. He also added that all the villagers were pleased that the applicant had left the village. In a further statement, Mr Muhsettin Yöyler told M.A. that the applicant had always been a PKK supporter, that the applicant and his family had not been in the village on the night of the incident, that he had not seen who had set fire to the house, but that he was sure that it was not the security forces. He also stated that the applicant himself might perhaps have done it. 23. Mr Abdulcebbar Sezen was recorded as having declared to the police officer that the applicant was a member of the PKK, that he used to be a source of trouble in the village and that the villagers were pleased that he had left the village. He also stated that the applicant's house had definitely not been burned by the security forces or the gendarmes and that the security forces had always helped the villagers. 24. Mr Muhlis Umulgan recalled having declared that the applicant was collaborating with the PKK, that on the night of the incident he had seen the applicant's house burning but had been afraid to go out, as he knew that the PKK were in the region at the time. He added that the security forces had not set fire to the applicant's house. 25. As to Süleyman Yılmaz, he declared that the applicant had not been in the village when the incident had occurred, that three days before the fire his spouse and children had left the village as well, taking the furniture, and that although some days before the incident security forces had been in the village, they had not been there during the incident. He finally stated that he did not know who had set fire to the applicant's house but was sure that it had not been the gendarmes. 26. The investigation could not continue in the applicant's absence. According to a letter of 2 April 1995 from the Gendarme Central Command in Malazgirt, the applicant had left Dirimpınar for an unknown place, probably Adapazarı. 27. The documents contained under this heading concern the applicant's statement letters and his petitions to the authorities about his complaints as well as the statements made by several witnesses in support of the applicant's allegations. 28. The documents listed below pertain to the applicant's complaints about the destruction of his house by the Malazgirt gendarmerie forces. (i) Petition by the applicant dated 23 September 1994 to the Karşıyaka public prosecutor's office for submission to the Malazgirt public prosecutor's office; (ii) Letter from the applicant to Kerim Yıldız of the Kurdish Human Rights Project (“KHRP”) in London, containing his complaints about the destruction of his property; (iii) A report dated 23 November 1994, signed by the applicant, setting out the sequence of the impugned events and the details of the property destroyed; (iv) Letter of 11 May 2000 from the applicant to Kerim Yıldız and Philip Leach of the KHRP, in which he set out his efforts to exhaust domestic remedies in regard to his complaints; (v) Letter of 4 July 2000 from the applicant to the KHRP concerning the statements taken by the gendarmerie from the muhtar, Muhsettin Yöyler. (vi) Letter dated 9 December 2000 from the applicant to Kerim Yıldız of the KHRP, containing his comments about the statements taken by the gendarmes from his fellow villagers. 29. The witnesses mentioned below alleged in their statements that gendarmes had burned the applicant's house along with some other houses in Dirimpınar on 18 September 1994.

Pastor Ridruejo, Mr M. Pellonpää and Mrs S. Boutoucharova) took oral evidence from 2 to 5 April 2001 from thirty witnesses. A further four witnesses had been summoned but did not appear for various reasons. The Delegates took evidence from the following witnesses [Nota: The verbatim records of the evidence given by the witnesses are available to the public at the Court's archives.]: (1) Celalettin Yöyler; (2) Dilsa Yöyler; (3) Saliha Yöyler; (4) Leyla Yöyler; (5) Gülistan Yöyler; (6) Evin Yöyler; (7) Ahmet Kınay; (8) Bahattin Kınay; (9) Esma (Ziri) Yöyler; (10) Kutbettin Fırtına; (11) Zeynel Abidin Daş; (12) Mehmet Şirin Yıldız; (13) Selahattin Yıldırım; (14) Serhat Yöyler; (15) Hakan Tekin; (16) Halil İbrahim Akkan; (17) Muhsettin Yöyler; (18) Abdulcabbar Sezen; (19) Muhlis Umulgan; (20) Ömer Sezen; (21) Ahmet Çelik (22) İsmail Mezgil; (23) Süleyman Yılmaz; (24) Fuat Girişken; (25) Mustafa Akkan; (26) Erdal Yanıker; (27) Halil İbrahim Kuş; (28) Sacit Savaşçı; (29) Cengiz Yıldız; (30) Turgut Abaş. 37. Article 125 of the Constitution provides: “All acts or decisions of the administration are subject to judicial review ... The administration shall be liable to indemnify any damage caused by its own acts and measures.” 38. The above provision is not subject to any restrictions even in a state of emergency or war. The latter requirement of the provision does not necessarily require proof of the existence of any fault on the part of the administration, whose responsibility is of an absolute, objective nature, based on a concept of collective liability and referred to as the theory of “social risk”. Thus, the administration may indemnify people who have suffered damage from acts committed by unknown or terrorist authors when the State may be said to have failed in its duty to maintain public order and safety, or in its duty to safeguard individual life and property. 39. The principle of administrative liability is reflected in the additional section 1 of Law no. 2935 of 25 October 1983 on the State of Emergency, which provides: “... actions for compensation in relation to the exercise of the powers conferred by this Law shall be brought against the administration before the administrative courts.” 40. The Criminal Code makes it a criminal offence (a) to deprive an individual unlawfully of his or her liberty (Article 179 generally, Article 181 in respect of civil servants); (b) to oblige an individual through force or threats to commit or not to commit an act (Article 188); (c) to issue threats (Article 191); (d) to make an unlawful search of an individual's home (Articles 193 and 194); (e) to commit arson (Articles 369, 370, 371, 372), or in case human life is endangered aggravated arson (Article 382), (f) to commit arson unintentionally by carelessness, negligence or inexperience (Article 383); or (g) to damage another's property intentionally (Articles 526 et seq.). 41. For all these offences complaints may be lodged, pursuant to Articles 151 and 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, with the public prosecutor or the local administrative authorities. The public prosecutor and the police have a duty to investigate crimes reported to them, the former deciding whether a prosecution should be initiated, pursuant to Article 148 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. A complainant may appeal against the decision of the public prosecutor not to institute criminal proceedings. 42. If the suspected authors of the contested acts are military personnel, they may also be prosecuted for causing extensive damage, endangering human lives or damaging property, if they have not followed orders in conformity with Articles 86 and 87 of the Military Code. Proceedings in these circumstances may be initiated by the persons concerned (non-military) before the competent authority under the Code of Criminal Procedure, or before the suspected persons' hierarchical superior (sections 93 and 95 of Law no. 353 on the Constitution and Procedure of Military Courts). 43. If the alleged author of a crime is an agent of the State, permission to prosecute must be obtained from local administrative councils (the Executive Committee of the Provincial Assembly). An appeal against the local council's decisions lies to the Supreme Administrative Court; a refusal to prosecute is subject to an automatic appeal of this kind. 44. Any illegal act by civil servants, be it a crime or a tort, which causes material or moral damage may be the subject of a claim for compensation before the ordinary civil courts. 45. Proceedings against the administration may be brought before the administrative courts, whose proceedings are in writing. 46. Damage caused by terrorist violence may be compensated out of the Aid and Social Solidarity Fund. 47. Extensive powers have been granted to state of emergency the regional governor by decrees enacted under Law no. 2935 on the State of Emergency (25 October 1983), especially Decree no. 285, as amended by Decrees nos. 424 and 425, and Decree no. 430. 48. Decree no. 285 modifies the application of Law no. 3713, the Prevention of Terrorism Act (1991), in those areas which are subject to the state of emergency, with the effect that the powers to prosecute members of the security forces is removed from the public prosecutor and conferred on local administrative councils. These councils are made up of civil servants and are under the authority of the provincial governors who also head the security forces. 49. Article 8 of Decree no. 430 of 16 December 1990 provides: “No criminal, financial or legal responsibility may be claimed against the state of emergency regional governor or a provincial governor within a state of emergency region in respect of their decisions or acts connected with the exercise of the powers entrusted to them by this decree, and no application shall be made to any judicial authority to this end. This is without prejudice to the rights of individuals to claim indemnity from the State for damage suffered by them without justification.” According to the applicant, this Article grants impunity to the governors and reinforces the powers of the regional governor to order the permanent or temporary evacuation of villages, to impose residence restrictions and to enforce the transfer of people to other areas. Damage caused in the context of the fight against terrorism would be “with justification” and therefore immune from suit.","['13', '3', '8']",[],[],"['14', '18']",[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in the village of Solontsievka, Kharkiv Region, Ukraine. 5. On 15 March 1998 the applicant’s husband, who worked as an electrician at the construction site, died as a result of a work-related accident. On 10 September 1998 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Dzerzhynsky District Court of Kharkiv against a joint stock company “T.”(“the company”) claiming compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage sustained as a result of his death. 6. On 15 September 1998 the case was transferred to the Zhovtnevy District Court of Kharkiv, which on 24 January 2001 allowed in part the applicant’s claims. 7. On 24 April 2001 the Kharkiv Regional Court upheld this judgment. It became final. 8. On 21 June 2001 the amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure entered into force. They provided a right to lodge a cassation appeal within a three-month period with the Supreme Court against court decisions adopted before 21 June 2001 and which had entered into force before that date. On 19 July 2001 the company lodged an appeal in cassation. 9. On 28 February 2002 the Supreme Court quashed the decisions of the lower courts and remitted the case for a fresh consideration to the first instance court. 10. In the course of the proceedings before the first instance court three other companies and the local department of the State Insurance Fund for Work-Related Accidents and Diseases (“the Fund”) were joined as co-defendants. 11. On 10 March 2006 the Zhovtnevy District Court of Kharkiv found in part for the applicant. The court awarded her, inter alia, UAH 68,648.34 (about EUR 11,366) to be paid by the Fund. 12. The Fund appealed against that judgment; however, on 24 October 2006 the Kharkiv Regional Court of Appeal declined its appeal as lodged out of time. The Fund appealed in cassation. On 13 December 2007 the Lugansk Regional Court of Appeal, sitting as a court of cassation, quashed that decision and remitted the matter of the admissibility of the appeal for a fresh consideration. 13. On 5 November 2008 the Kharkiv Regional Court of Appeal partly allowed the appeal by the Fund and ruled that the above amount of UAH 68,648.34 should be paid by the company and not by the Fund. It upheld the remainder of the judgment.","['13', '6']",['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicants are: 1) Ms Tsalipat Shamilovna Isigova, who was born in 1954; 2) Ms Aminat Abdurakhmanovna Isigova, who was born in 1976; 3) Ms Khalisat Dayevna Umkhanova, who was born in 1948; 4) Ms Taisiya Magomedovna Musayeva, who was born in 1970; 5) Mr Arbi Zelimkhanovich Umkhanov, who was born in 1997. 7. On 2 July 2001 the federal armed forces carried out a large-scale “sweeping” operation (“zachistka”) in the village of Sernovodsk in Chechnya. According to the Government, interior troops of the Ministry of the Interior participated in the operation. 8. The applicants submitted numerous NGO and press reports on these events as well as statements by other villagers about the general circumstances of the sweeping operation and the detention of their relatives. 9. According to the applicants, a similar operation took place in the nearby village of Assinovskaya on 3 July 2001, where about 300 persons were detained. 10. The first applicant is the mother of Apti Isigov, who was born in 1978. The second applicant is the first applicant's daughter and Apti Isigov's sister. They live at 34 Pervomayskaya Street in Sernovodsk. According to the applicants, at the material time Apti Isigov was planning to enrol in a law faculty in Moscow. 11. According to the first applicant, at about 12 noon on 2 July 2001 an armoured personnel carrier (“APC”) pulled up in front of their house. The first applicant noted that the APC identification number was Ch025. Several armed men in camouflage uniforms rushed into the courtyard, where the applicant's son Apti Isigov and his cousin Rustam Isigov, who lived in the same house, had been waiting for them with their passports in hand. The first applicant submitted that the documents were in order. Nevertheless, the soldiers had collected the passports without looking at them, pulled the Isigov cousins' shirts over their heads and forced them into the APC. In reply to the first applicant's question about the reasons for their arrest, the servicemen stated that they had orders to detain every man aged between 15 and 50. 12. The soldiers then searched the house and, according to the first applicant, took some money and household items. 13. Rustam Isigov later recalled that the APC into which they were put had stopped in a neighbouring street and they had been ordered to get out and to climb into a military truck. He had noticed a serviceman with five or six passports in his hand nearby. There were several people inside the truck, both detainees and servicemen. One of the servicemen had ordered Apti Isigov to climb into the far corner of the truck and to cover himself with a piece of canvas attached to the side. Apti had obeyed. 14. The detainees had then been taken to a passport checkpoint situated in a field near the village, where the basement of an unfinished building stood. Rustam Isigov and other detainees had been ordered out of the truck. Apti was ordered to stay in the vehicle but got out and sat on the ground with the rest of them. He was frightened and Rustam Isigov had tried to calm him down, even though the detainees were not allowed to talk. About 15 minutes later a man in camouflage uniform had arrived, had looked through a passport he had been holding and had ordered Apti Isigov to climb back into the truck. 15. The first applicant referred to the statements of other witnesses she had managed to collect which stated that Apti Isigov had then been brought to the APC no. Ch025 and had spent some time inside. Several witnesses among those detained that day stated that they had seen Apti in the APC in the afternoon of 2 July 2001, several hours after his apprehension. One of those witnesses was K. Ch. who had been taken to the passport checkpoint at about 7.40 p.m. and had seen Apti Isigov inside the APC. 16. The third applicant is the mother of Zelimkhan Umkhanov, who was born in 1972. The fourth applicant is Zelimkhan Umkhanov's wife and the fifth applicant their son. Zelimkhan Umkhanov and his family used to live in Grozny, but after the resumption of hostilities moved to Sernovodsk to his mother's home because he thought they would be safer there. 17. The third and fourth applicants did not witness Zelimkhan Umkhanov's detention but referred to eye-witness statements submitted by them to the Court. According to those statements, at about 4 p.m. on 2 July 2001 Zelimkhan Umkhanov was detained in Groznensky Lane in Sernovodosk. The applicants submitted several statements of villagers who had witnessed Zelimkhan's detention in the street. Several witnesses, including K. Ch. (see above), stated that they had seen Zelimkhan Umkhanov in APC no. Ch025 in the afternoon of 2 July 2001. 18. The first, third and fourth applicants, along with other relatives of those detained during the “sweeping” operation, walked to the edge of the field where the men had been detained and remained there until about midnight. The guards did not allow them to approach any nearer. 19. According to the applicants, at about 6 p.m. an officer with the rank of major came out and reassured them that all the detainees would be released 30 minutes later. He also told them that he shared their indignation and that he had already talked to his superiors about the events. Later that evening he came out once again and repeated his comments. 20. At about 8 p.m. the women saw some of the detainees being put into two buses. When the buses drove off, the women tried to block them, but the soldiers started to shoot at the ground in front of the crowd and dispersed them. 21. The men from Sernovodsk remained detained at the passport checkpoint in the field until the early hours of 3 July 2001. At about 11 p.m. the military started to release them in small groups, and by 2 a.m. there was no one left in the field. About forty men were not released, however, and their relatives were eventually told that they had been taken to the Temporary Office of the Interior of Achkhoy-Martan District (“the Achkhoy-Martan VOVD”). Apti Isigov and Zelimkhan Umkhanov were not released that night, and the applicants have had no news of them since. 22. Early in the morning on 3 July 2001 the fourth applicant went to the military camp in an attempt to obtain information about her husband from the major who had talked to them the night before, but the military were already leaving and she was unable to speak to anyone. 23. Later in the morning on 3 July 2001 the first, third and fourth applicants, along with other relatives who had not seen their detained family members since the previous day, went to the Achkhoy-Martan VOVD. There they were shown a list of about forty names of persons from Sernovodsk, including Apti Isigov and Zelimkhan Umkhanov, who had been brought to the Achkhoy-Martan VOVD. According to the applicants, during the day detainees were gradually released from the Achkhoy-Martan VOVD, but they told the applicants that they had not seen their relatives inside. In the evening of 3 July 2001 the head of the Sernovodsk village administration joined the applicants at the Achkhoy-Martan VOVD. In reply to their enquiries the officials there denied that the two men had ever been brought there, contrary to what they had said in the morning. 24. On 4 July 2001 the applicants went to the village of Assinovskaya, in which a similar “sweeping” operation was being carried out. They saw the APC with the identification number Ch025 there and the same truck in which their two relatives had been taken away from Sernovodsk two days earlier, a Ural with identification no. O 10 03 KSh. 25. On the same date the applicants also talked to R. Kh., who had attended the same school as Apti Isigov and knew him quite well. He stated that on 3 July 2001 he had seen Apti Isigov and Zelimkhan Umkhanov in a military Ural truck in Assinovskaya. R. Kh. said that he had heard someone asking for water from inside the truck saying that “we have not had any water since yesterday” and when one of the military lifted the canvas to give him some water, the witness had seen two men, one of whom he had immediately recognised as Apti Isigov. Both men had traces of beatings on their faces, and Zelimkhan's hand was hurt, probably broken. R. Kh.'s written statement was submitted to the Court. 26. That day the applicants waited near the passport checkpoint in the field near Assinovskaya until 3 a.m. hoping that their relatives would be released together with the detainees from that village, but in vain. 27. They and their other relatives continued to search for the two missing men. On numerous occasions, both in person and in writing, they applied to prosecutors at various levels, to the Ministry of the Interior, to the administrative authorities in Chechnya, to the Special Envoy of the Russian President for Rights and Freedoms in the Chechen Republic, to the media and to public figures. In their letters to the authorities the applicants gave details of the detention of Apti Isigov and Zelimkhan Umkhanov and asked for assistance and information about the investigation, but were given hardly anything of substance. On several occasions they and other relatives received copies of letters forwarding their requests to various prosecution services. 28. On 4 and 5 July 2001 the applicants and their relatives applied in person to the Prosecutor's Office of the Achkhoy-Martan District and submitted a written complaint. They also applied in person to the Achkhoy-Martan VOVD. They asked for assistance in searching for the two missing men, but the officials denied that they had ever been detained by the district authorities. 29. On 5 July 2001 the Prosecutor's Office of the Achkhoy-Martan District forwarded the applicants' complaints to the Achkhoy-Martan VOVD. The latter replied to the first applicant in a letter of 10 July 2001 that Apti Isigov had not been detained by the VOVD and that the local office of the Interior had no information about his whereabouts. 30. On 12 July 2001 the third applicant wrote to the head of the administration of the Sunzhenskiy District and asked for assistance in finding Zelimkhan Umkhanov and Apti Isigov. She referred to witness statements and submitted the known details of the two men's apprehension, including the identification numbers of the military vehicles and call-signs of the military involved. 31. On 12 July 2001 Rustam Isigov, who, as noted above, was Apti Isigov's cousin and a witness to his detention, wrote to the head of the Chechen Department of the Interior and on 13 August 2001 to the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic. He described in detail the events of 2 July 2001 and requested that his cousin be found. 32. On 17 July 2001 the Prosecutor's Office of the Achkhoy-Martan District informed the third applicant that her son had not been detained by personnel of the district department of the Interior and had not been brought to the Achkhoy-Martan VOVD. 33. On 13 August 2001 the second and fourth applicants wrote to the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic to complain that they had not been granted victim status in the criminal proceedings concerning the disappearance of their brother and husband respectively. On the same date the fourth applicant requested the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic to institute criminal proceedings in respect of her husband's abduction. 34. The applicants reiterated their requests for assistance in searching for their relatives and information on the progress of the investigation to the Prosecutor General's Office on 16 August 2001 and 2 October 2001, the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic on 16 August 2001, 12 and 23 September 2001 and the Minister of Defence on 1 October 2001. 35. On 8 July 2001 the Prosecutor's Office of the Achkhoy-Martan District instituted criminal proceedings in connection with numerous complaints of the residents of Sernovodsk of abuse of authority by federal servicemen during a special operation of 2 July 2001. The case file was assigned number 27031. 36. On 10 September 2001 the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic informed the third applicant of the decision of 8 July 2001, stating that the disappearance of Apti Isigov and Zelimkhan Umkhanov was being investigated in the context of those proceedings. On 3 October 2001 the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic informed the applicants that the proceedings in criminal case no. 27031 were pending and that they would be informed of the outcome. 37. On 19 October 2001 the Ministry of the Interior replied to the applicants that their complaint had been forwarded to the Chechen Department of the Interior and that the search for their relatives would remain under the control of the Ministry. 38. On 22 November 2001 the Ministry of the Interior informed the applicants that a number of steps aiming at locating their relatives' whereabouts had been taken. In particular, the Achkhoy-Martan VOVD had opened “search files” (розыскные дела) and the two men had been included in the federal search database as well as in the system of identification of unidentified bodies. However, those efforts had not brought any results thus far. The letter assured the applicants that they would be informed of any results of the search. 39. On 10 September 2002 the third applicant requested the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic to update her on the results of the investigation. 40. In similar letters dated 3 October 2002 the latter replied to each of the applicants that on 8 July 2001 the Prosecutor's Office of the Achkhoy-Martan District had opened criminal investigation no. 27031 in connection with the allegations of abuse of authority, unlawful use of violence and detention, theft and destruction of property during the special operation in Sernovodsk on 2-4 July 2001 and that the investigation was being conducted by the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic. It had established that at about 11.20 a.m. and 4 p.m. respectively on 2 July 2001, Apti Isigov and Zelimkhan Umkhanov had been detained and that their whereabouts had remained unknown since. APC no. Ch025 belonged to military unit no. 6783, which had participated in the operation. During questioning, the APC crew had stated that they had taken a number of people to the location of Ministry of Justice detachments which had been carrying out identity checks on the detainees. The investigating authorities had also questioned a number of servicemen from the Ministry of Justice who had stated that pursuant to an order of Lieutenant-Colonel G., the deputy commander of the operation, they had put two “Chechens” into a separate vehicle. On 5 July 2001, also upon the deputy commander's orders, the two men had been taken to the military base in Khankala (the main Russian military base in Chechnya) where they had been handed over to servicemen from the Ministry of the Interior. However, given that no record concerning their apprehension or detention had been drawn up, it had been impossible to establish their identities. The letters did not specify whether Lieutenant-Colonel G. had been questioned as a witness. It was further stated that the investigating authorities had been unable either to identify those responsible or to establish the whereabouts of Apti Isigov and Zelimkhan Umkhanov. The search had also involved verification of unidentified bodies in Chechnya and the neighbouring regions. The relatives of those missing had been granted victim status in the criminal proceedings. The letters concluded that on 12 June 2002 the investigation had been suspended owing to the failure to identify the alleged perpetrators. 41. According to the applicants, between July 2001 and May 2002 at least five investigators of the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic had been appointed in turn to deal with the case. The missing men's personal details, such as their height, shoe size and photographs, had only been collected from the applicants in the spring of 2002. The applicants also submitted that the investigators had complained to them that they had had no answers or assistance from the military authorities of the Khankala base in establishing the whereabouts of Apti Isigov and Zelimkhan Umkhanov. 42. On 26 October 2002 the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic, in reply to a query from the first applicant, confirmed that her son was being searched for by the law-enforcement bodies and that the investigation in criminal case no. 27031 had been suspended on 12 June 2002, as it had been impossible to identify those responsible. 43. On 12 November 2002 similar information was sent to Zelimkhan Umkhanov's father. 44. In a letter of 20 March 2003 the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic informed the fourth applicant that the criminal proceedings in case no. 27031 had been resumed on 19 March 2003. 45. In a letter of 18 April 2003 the SRJI, on behalf of the first and third applicants, requested the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic to inform them of the developments in the investigation and to grant them victim status in the proceedings. On 24 July 2003 the SRJI sent a copy of its previous letter to the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic, as it had not received any reply. On the same date the applicants forwarded a similar letter to the Prosecutor General's Office. 46. On 19 April 2003 the investigation was suspended on account of the failure to identify the culprits. 47. On 25 August 2003 the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic replied to the SRJI's request lodged on the applicants' behalf that criminal case no. 27031 had been forwarded to the Southern Federal Circuit Department of the Prosecutor General's Office for examination. 48. According to the Government, “having obtained reliable information that Apti Isigov and Zelimkhan Umkhanov had disappeared during the special operation”, on 14 April 2003 the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic decided that a case in respect of the disappearance of the applicants' two relatives under Article 126 (2) of the Russian Criminal Code (aggravated kidnapping) should be opened and severed from criminal case no. 27031. It appears that the new case was first assigned number 59114 which was then changed to number 34/33/0506-03. It was sent for investigation to the military prosecutor's office of military unit no. 20102 in Khankala in order to check the possible involvement of military personnel in the alleged offence. 49. In his decision of 14 April 2003 to open criminal case no. 59114, the deputy prosecutor of the Chechen Republic, “having examined the information on a criminal offence committed on 2 July 2001 during the special operation of the federal forces in Sernovodsk, which had been submitted by an investigator of the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic on 14 April 2003”, established that: “On 2 July 2001, during a special operation in the village of Sernovodsk of the Sunzhenskiy District of the Chechen Republic, A.A. Isigov and Z.U. Umkhanov were detained and taken away in APC no. Ch025 by detachments of the federal forces. However, they were not delivered to the passport checkpoint situated on the outskirts of Sernovodsk. Their whereabouts remain unknown to date. The investigation has established that the APC belonged to [a detachment] of the Ministry of the Interior which, during the operation, was under the command of the commander of military unit no. 6785, Major [M.]. The crew of APC no. Ch025 was under the command of Senior Lieutenant [K.].” 50. The decision then made orders for a criminal case to be opened under Article 126 (2) of the Russian Criminal Code and criminal proceedings to be brought against M. and K. on suspicion of the abduction of the applicants' two relatives. 51. In a letter of 17 April 2003, the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic informed the first and third applicants “in reply to their numerous queries” that on 14 April 2003 criminal proceedings no. 59114 had been instituted under Article 126 (2) in connection with the abduction of their sons on 2 July 2001 by participants of the special operation carried out by the federal forces in Sernovodsk. The letter stated that the applicants would be notified of any results of the investigation. 52. On 21 May 2003 the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic transferred the criminal case to the Military Prosecutor's Office of the United Group Alignment (UGA, Объединенная группировка войск). The decision, submitted by the Government, read as follows: “On 2 July 2001, during a special operation in the village of Sernovodsk of the Sunzhenskiy District of the Chechen Republic conducted by federal forces, Ministry of the Interior troops detained [A.A.] Isigov, who was born in 1978, and [Z.U.] Umkhanov, who was born in 1972, whose whereabouts have yet to be established. On 2 July 2001 a special operation was conducted in the village of Sernovodsk in the Sunzhenskiy District of the Chechen Republic in accordance with the UGA commander's directive no. 3/01743 of 26 June 2001 and UGA order no. 3/01846 of 1 July 2001. The UGA deputy commander in respect of special operations, Colonel [B.], was the head of the operation. Detachments from the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of the Interior, the Federal Security Service and the Temporary United Alignment of Agencies and Units of the Ministry of the Interior [ВОГО и П МВД – временная объединенная группировка органов и подразделений МВД] took part in its conduct. Units 99 DON, 352 ORB [ОРБ – отдельный разведывательный батальон], 46 OBRON [ОБРОН – отдельная бригада оперативного назначения], special task units nos. 8 and 12 under the command of Colonel [V.] took part in the operation on behalf of Ministry of the Interior troops. A passport checkpoint was established on the outskirts of Sernovodsk in order to check the passports of those detained. This work was carried out by 14 officials of the Department of Execution of Punishments of the Ministry of Justice under the command of Major [Vas.], who arrived in [two special vehicles for transporting the detainees] and a bus, and by four members of operations staff of the Temporary United Alignment of Agencies and Units of the Ministry of the Interior under the command of Major [Mos.]. Pursuant to an order by Colonel [B.], 15 joint search groups were formed of servicemen from special task units nos. 8 and 12, 352 ORB, military unit no. 6783, 46 OBRON... and policemen under the command of officers from Ministry of the Interior troops. Cover for the groups was provided by armoured Ministry of the Interior units whose identifications numbers were concealed by mud on the orders of the operation commanders. In the morning of 2 July 2001,, one of the search groups under the command of the head of intelligence of 46 OBRON Lieutenant-Colonel [M.] detained [R.S.] Isigov and [A.A.] Isigov at 34 Pervomayskaya Street. They were both taken out of the house by subordinates of [M.] and put in APC-80 (identification no. Ch025), which was under the command of a head of platoon from military unit no. 6785 Senior Lieutenant [K.]. In the course of the preliminary investigation it has been established that in the morning of 2 July 2001 [A.A.] Isigov was held in APC-80 (identification no. Ch025) under the command of Senior Lieutenant [K.] and subsequently in a Ural military vehicle. In the afternoon [A.A.] Isigov returned to [the] APC, where he was held together with [Z.U.] Umkhanov. During the conduct of the special operation in Sernovodsk on 2 July 2001 one of the search groups detained... [Z.U.] Umkhanov, who resided at 4 Kutalova Street, Sernovodsk. During the afternoon of 2 July 2001 he was also held in APC-80 [with the identification no.] Ch025. After their detention by the Ministry of Interior troops on 2 July 2001 A.A. Isigov and Z.U. Umkhanov were not brought to the passport checkpoint or transferred to the police. Nor are they listed in the register of residents of Sernovodsk who were detained at the passport checkpoint. R.S. Isigov, who was questioned as a witness, stated that some time after he and A. Isigov had been apprehended by the servicemen and placed in the APC they were transferred to a Ural vehicle in which other residents of the village had already been placed. That vehicle had taken them to the passport checkpoint where everybody except for his cousin had got out. A. Isigov had then been taken to an unknown destination. During the night between 2 and 3 July 2001 R.S. Isigov had been allowed to go home and his passport had been returned to him. On the basis of the records of questioning of officials from the Department of Execution of Punishments of the Ministry of Justice it has been established that during the operation three residents of Sernovodsk of Chechen ethnic origin were held in [the special vehicle used for transporting detainees] without proper documents authorising their detention. The investigation has established that those persons were [Kud.], [Gan.] and [Gad.], who on 3 July 2001 were brought to the village of Assinovskaya and then transferred to the Achkhoy-Martan VOVD. On 3 July 2001 witnesses [R.Kh.] and [V.Kh.], who resided [in] the village of Assinovskaya, saw A.A. Isigov in a military vehicle ZIL-131 in which they were also placed by Ministry of the Interior troops and taken to the passport checkpoint on the outskirts of Assinovskaya for an [identity] control. [V.Kh.] identified Senior Lieutenant [K.] as the head of the group that had detained them on 3 July 2001 and ordered them to be put in the military vehicle ZIL-131 where an acquaintance, A. Isigov from Sernovodsk, was already held. There was also another man in the vehicle, whom the witnesses had not been able to see clearly. Both men's arms were tied. However, neither A.A. Isigov nor Z.U. Ukhmanov are mentioned in the records pertaining to the period from 3 to 5 July 2001 in the register kept at the passport checkpoint in the village of Assinovskaya. Therefore, it is established that between 2 and 5 July 2001 A.A. Isigov and Z.U. Ukhmanov were neither held in [the special vehicles used for transporting detainees] by the Department of Execution of Punishments of the Ministry of Justice nor brought to the [premises of the] Temporary United Alignment of Agencies and Units of the Ministry of the Interior. On 5 July 2001 three persons of Chechen ethnic origin were brought to the Temporary United Alignment of Agencies and Units of the Ministry of the Interior in Khankala. However, they were residents of the village of Assinovskaya... and were released later at the request of [the head of the village administration]. On 14 April 2003 materials concerning the kidnapping of A.A. Isigov and Z.U. Ukhmanov on 2 July 2001 by participants of the special operation were separated from criminal case no. 27031, and criminal case no. 59114 was opened... In the course of the preliminary investigation it has been established that servicemen from military units nos. 6783 and 6785 under the command of Lieutenant Colonel [M.] and Senior Lieutenant [K.] were involved in the abduction of A.A. Isigov and Z.U. Ukhmanov. This has been confirmed by the records of questioning of witnesses [D.], [K.] and [Gar.] and by reports of identification by [M.], [K.], [Gar.] and [D.] and by witnesses and victims. [G.], who was questioned as a witness, submitted that Ministry of the Interior troops had, in breach of orders of the head of the operation Colonel [B.], independently carried out searches and apprehended persons on 2 July 2001 in Sernovodsk. [G.] had informed Colonel [V.]of this, but he had ignored the information. Witness [K.] submitted that during the day of 2 July 2001 he had received by radio transmitter numerous orders[from M.] to take his APC-80 [with identification no.] Ch025 to specified addresses in Sernovodsk and to accept persons apprehended by intelligence units of the Ministry of the Interior troops. [Those arrested were] subsequently to be delivered to the passport checkpoint and transferred to offices used by troops from the Alignment [of Agencies and Units] of the Ministry of the Interior without any documents [authorising their detention]. He also submitted that he had witnessed a quarrel between [M.] and a local resident which had taken place in the afternoon of 2 July 2001 relating to the order requiring the identification numbers of the armoured vehicles to be covered in mud. [M.] had ordered [K.] to cover the identification number Ch025 of the APC-80 in mud as well. Therefore, it is established that Ministry of the Interior troops were involved in the abduction of A.A. Isigov and Z.U. Ukhmanov. Furthermore, the investigation has refuted false statements by the heads of the special operation, Colonels [B.] and [V.] [who stated that] the servicemen had not been involved in detentions during the special operation. The lack of control by Colonel [V.] and Colonel [B.] over the conduct of the operation and their failure to perform their duties properly led to the commission of this premeditated crime by servicemen. In breach of the established order concerning the conduct of the special operation, the Ministry of the Interior troops independently carried out checks of private households and detained and searched people and took them to the passport checkpoint. Furthermore, Colonels [V.] and [B.] concealed from the UGA command the abduction of A.A. Isigov and Z.U. Ukhmanov by Ministry of the Interior troops under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel [M.] and Senior Lieutenant [K.], who had participated in the special operation of 2 July 2001. Since the preliminary investigation of this type of offence ... is carried out by the military prosecutor's office ... criminal case no. 59114 ... [shall be] transferred to the UGA Military Prosecutor's Office...” 53. On 25 August 2003 the UGA Military Prosecutor's Office said in reply to an enquiry from the fourth applicant that the case was being investigated by the military prosecutor's office of military unit no. 20102. 54. On 13 September 2003 the military prosecutor's office of military unit no. 20102 extended the term of the preliminary investigation until 14 October 2003. The decision described the investigative acts that had been performed, which included: the questioning of twenty-nine residents of Sernovodsk; the questioning of the first, third and fourth applicants and granting them victim status; the questioning of servicemen M., K., Kom., D. “and others” who had taken part in the operation. It was further stated that additional steps were required to complete the investigation. 55. On 23 September 2003 the military prosecutor's office of military unit no. 20102 informed the SRJI that they were in the process of investigating criminal case no. 34/33/0506-03, which had been instituted under Article 126 (2) of the Russian Criminal Code by the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic on 14 April 2003. It stated that it had received the case file in May 2003 and victim status in the proceedings had been granted to the first, third and fourth applicants. In that connection, the military prosecutor's office noted that copies of the decision granting victim status could only be served on the victims. In conclusion it was stated that the relatives of the missing men would be notified of the results of the investigation. 56. On 14 October 2003 the military prosecutor's office informed the applicants that the preliminary investigation had been suspended on 14 October 2003, in accordance with Article 208 (1) § 3 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure and that they could challenge that decision before a superior prosecutor or in court. 57. On 10 November 2003 the military prosecutor's office resumed the proceedings and notified the fourth applicant accordingly. 58. On 10 December 2003 it again suspended the investigation, on this occasion on account of the death of suspect M. and the fact that suspect K. had been transferred to a different region. 59. On 19 December 2003 the Leninskiy District Court of Grozny declared Zelimkhan Umkhanov a missing person as from 2 July 2001. 60. On 17 January 2005 the Moscow City Military Prosecutor's Office resumed the investigation. 61. On 25 January 2005 it suspended the investigation. The first and third applicants were notified accordingly. The decision read as follows: “On 14 April 2003 the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic instituted criminal proceedings under Article 126 (2) of the Criminal Code against [M.], [K.] and other persons. On 2 July 2001, during a special operation in the village of Sernovodsk of the Sunzhenskiy District of the Chechen Republic, A.A. Isigov and Z.U. Umkhanov were detained and taken away in APC no. Ch025. Their whereabouts have not been established. On 17 January 2004 the Chief Military Prosecutor's Office transferred the criminal case to the Moscow City Military Prosecutor's Office with instructions to take additional investigative and other steps. On the same date the investigation was resumed. In the course of the investigation it was established that APC no. Ch025 belonged to Ministry of the Interior troops [detachment] 46 OBRON, which during the special operation had been under the command of [K.], who was subordinate to [M.]. On 19 March 2003 [K.] was transferred ... to military unit no. 6702 in Moscow. However, according to the extract from order no. 38 dated 27 February 2004 of the commander of military unit no. 6702, [K.] was no longer on the list of staff of the military unit as he had [retired]. On 16 March 2003 [M.] died in [a Ministry of the Interior hospital]. In view of the fact that all investigative measures possible in the absence of the suspects have been taken ... the preliminary investigation ... should be suspended until there is a real possibility of [K.] participating in it or until his recovery.” 62. On 4 March 2005 the military prosecutor's office of military unit no. 20102 resumed the criminal proceedings. 63. By a decision of 21 March 2005 it discontinued the criminal proceedings in case no. 34/33/0506-03. The first and the third applicants were informed accordingly. The decision stated that on 2 July 2001, during a special operation conducted by detachments of the federal armed forces and the Ministry of the Interior in the village of Sernovodsk, a group of servicemen under the command of Major M. from military unit no. 6783 had detained Apti Isigov and Zelimkhan Umkhanov and put them in APC no. Ch025 under the command of Senior Lieutenant K. from the same military unit. The two detainees had then been delivered to the passport checkpoint and transferred to officers of the Department of Execution of Punishments of the Ministry of Justice. On the same day Apti Isigov and Zelimkhan Umkhanov had been taken away from the passport checkpoint by unidentified persons in to an unknown destination and their location had remained unestablished since. 64. The decision went on to say that in the above connection on 14 April 2003 the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic had instituted criminal proceedings against M., K. and others on suspicion of their involvement in a criminal offence under Article 126 (2) (aggravated kidnapping) of the Russian Criminal Code. According to the decision, a number of witnesses had been questioned during the investigation. In particular, suspect K. had stated that during the special operation of 2 July 2001 in Sernovodsk he had been entrusted with the task of delivering those detained in the course of that operation to a passport checkpoint on the outskirts of Sernovodsk and that he had not taken them anywhere else. He had also stated that he had had no information concerning the fate of the applicants' two relatives. Witness M. and the driver of APC no. Ch025 had given similar oral evidence. The latter had also stated that there were no detainees left in the vehicle after the termination of the operation. 65. According to the decision, the investigating authorities had also questioned Colonel G., who was one of the senior officers in charge of the operation. He had stated that detachments from the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of the Interior troops, special police units from the city of Moscow and the Stavropol Region, a Ministry of the Interior mobile detachment in the Chechen Republic, officers of the Achkhoy-Martan VOVD and personnel from the Ministry of Justice had taken part in the operation. Those detained during the operation had been delivered to a passport checkpoint on the outskirts of Sernovodsk. The identity check had been carried out by Ministry of Justice personnel. Colonel G. had also referred to reports by his officers that during the operation unidentified persons, who were probably representatives of law-enforcement agencies, had disembarked from helicopters which had landed in the village. Some of these agents had been wearing masks, whilst the servicemen under his command had not worn masks that day. 66. The decision further referred to the statements of four residents of Sernovodsk, including Apti Isigov's cousin Rustam Isigov (who had been detained on 2 July 2001), all of whom had stated that they had seen the applicants' two relatives delivered to the passport checkpoint on the outskirts of Sernovodsk. The first applicant and Rustam Isigov, who were questioned during the investigation, had stated that they had seen the names of Apti Isigov and Zelimkhan Umkhanov on the list of detainees at the Achkhoy-Martan VOVD on 3 July 2001. The decision also stated that on 16 March 2003 Major M. had died and on 27 February 2004 Senior Lieutenant K. had been discharged from service. 67. It then concluded that Major M., Senior Lieutenant K. and servicemen of the federal armed forces who had participated in the special operation in Sernovodsk on 2 July 2001 had not been involved in the abduction of Apti Isigov and Zelimkhan Umkhanov and that therefore the criminal proceedings against them should be discontinued “in the absence of evidence of an offence”. 68. On 31 March 2005 the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic resumed the criminal proceedings before suspending them on 4 April 2005 on account of the failure to identify the culprits. 69. On 7 March 2007 the Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic resumed the criminal proceedings. The third and the fourth applicants were informed accordingly. 70. Despite specific requests by the Court on several occasions, the Government refused to submit a copy of the entire investigation file opened into the disappearance of Apti Isigov and Zelimkhan Umkhanov on the ground that they were prohibited from doing so by Article 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. After the application had been declared admissible they submitted an update on the progress of the investigation and materials from the case file running to some 92 pages. The materials contained information on the conduct of the special operation in Sernovodsk, the investigative measures taken and the interim findings of the investigation. 71. Until 1 July 2002 criminal-law matters were governed by the 1960 Code of Criminal Procedure of the RSFSR. On 1 July 2002 the old Code was replaced by the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation (the new CCP). 72. Article 125 of the new CCP provides for the judicial review of decisions by investigators and prosecutors that might infringe the constitutional rights of participants in proceedings or prevent access to a court. 73. Article 161 of the new CCP stipulates that evidence from the preliminary investigation may not be disclosed. Part 3 of the same Article provides that information from the investigation file may be divulged with the permission of a prosecutor or investigator, but only in so far as it does not infringe the rights and lawful interests of the participants in the criminal proceedings and does not prejudice the investigation. It is prohibited to divulge information about the private life of participants in criminal proceedings without their permission. 74. Article 208 (1) § 3 lays down that the preliminary investigation must be suspended if the whereabouts of a suspect are known, but it is impossible to ensure his participation in criminal proceedings.","['13', '2', '3', '5']",[],[],['3'],[],[],1

He was paid at that stage an advance on royalties (33, 650 pounds sterling (GBP) net) and a further advance royalty payment (GBP 55,000) was due to him on publication. In September 1990 the Publisher announced the impending publication of the Book and it was published on 17 September 1990. 10. By letter of 14 September 1990 to the Publisher, the Treasury Solicitor stated that it would hold the Publisher liable for the applicant's breach of his duty of confidentiality. The Publisher denied the claims but confirmed that it would not make payments without notice to the Crown. The Treasury Solicitor's letter to the Publisher of 23 November 1990 considered the applicant liable for a breach of a fiduciary duty to the Crown: the Publisher rejected these claims. 11. The Attorney General (“AG”) issued a writ in the High Court on 24 May 1991 seeking from the applicant any financial benefit from publication (royalties already due from the Publisher and any future royalties) arguing that in writing and authorising the publication of the Book, he had acted in breach of the duty of confidence he owed to the Crown as a former member of the SIS. There was no reliance on the 1911 Act, the Official Secrets Act 1989 (“the 1989 Act”) or on the undertaking signed in 1944. 12. On 17 June 1991 a statement of claim was submitted. 13. On 17 November 1991 an extension of time was given for lodging the defence and this was filed on 6 January 1992. 14. By letter dated 3 December 1991 to the applicant, the Legal Aid Area Office refused legal aid and he appealed within the 14 day time-limit. By letter of 7 April 1992 that Office indicated that his appeal had been adjourned pending receipt from him of further information in relation to royalty payments already made to him and it was noted that he had not requested the Treasury Solicitor to release the monies held by the Publisher to fund his defence of the proceedings. In April and May 1992 the applicant requested the Treasury Solicitor to release the monies held by the Publisher to fund his defence, and these requests were refused (in April and July 1992, respectively). 15. In May 1992 the Publisher rejected the applicant's request for the payment of royalties due, or at least GBP 20,000, to cover legal costs maintaining that that was a matter between the applicant and the Crown. 16. On 20 May 1992 the applicant's sister completed a schedule detailing how the payments received from the Publisher had been spent: some on household goods with the majority given to family members. 17. On 3 July 1992 his solicitors informed the Legal Aid Area Office how the royalty payments to date had been spent and about the refusal of the Treasury Solicitor and the Publisher to release the monies to him. By letter dated 27 July 1992 from Legal Aid Area Office the applicant was informed that the Area Committee had rejected his appeal. It appeared to the Committee unreasonable that he should be granted representation: since the litigation was known to him, not later than 28 June 1991, he had voluntarily divested himself of substantial funds under his control and direction. The applicant claimed that he had given approximately GBP 20,000 to his children before 28 June 1991 and that only GBP 14,000 had been spent thereafter (most of which he had given to his son). The balance remaining (GBP 4,165) was insufficient to fund his litigation. 18. By letter dated 12 August 1992 the applicant informed the Treasury Solicitor that he would apply to the High Court for an order that the AG consent to the release of the relevant monies to fund his defence. This application was made on 20 August 1992 and on 21 August 1992 the matter was adjourned for a hearing before a judge. On 18 February 1993 the High Court dismissed the application finding that it had no jurisdiction to make an injunction against the Crown. The matter could be revisited if the Publisher was joined as a third party to the proceedings. On 8 March 1993 the High Court refused leave to appeal. 19. On 19 May 1993 the High Court allowed the applicant serve a third party notice on the Publisher, the notice issued on 24 June 1993, on 27 September 1993 the Publisher submitted its defence and counterclaim followed by, in February 1994, Further and Better Particulars of the Counterclaim. The Publisher did not oppose the release of funds and the applicant renewed his request for release of the funds. 20. On 22 June 1994 the High Court rejected his re-application for the release of the monies: the Crown's claim was prima facie a strong one. Many litigants presented their cases themselves and the court was able to ensure that there was a fair trial. Since he was a fugitive from justice and would not appear in person, the lack of legal representation would not deny him a fair trial. It was also noted that, by this time, he had received in the region of $11,000 for a German television documentary which could contribute to his legal costs. 21. On 12 August 1994 his solicitors applied and were granted leave to cease to act for the applicant. They could not continue to act on a pro bono basis and costs' orders had already been made against the applicant. 22. Given that the applicant would not be attending to represent himself and on the initiative of the AG, on 25 July 1995 the High Court appointed a Queen's Counsel and a junior counsel to act as amici curiae in the case. The Crown was also represented by Queen's Counsel and by junior counsel. The applicant was not present or further represented before the High Court. 23. On 1 and 2 April 1996 a hearing took place in the High Court. On 19 April 1996 the High Court rejected the AG's application by detailed judgment and, in particular, the AG's claim of a continuing fiduciary duty owed by the applicant to the Crown. On 20 May 1996 the Crown appealed. 24. The Legal Aid Area Office refused legal aid for the appeal by letter dated 30 May 1996 stating that the applicant had not shown reasonable grounds for taking, defending or being a party to proceedings. In particular, he had not made any comment on the Crown's grounds of appeal and it was not therefore possible to determine his likely prospects of success. He appealed this refusal, submitting detailed and reasoned argument. The Legal Aid Area Office, by letter dated 25 June 1996, confirmed the rejection of his appeal noting that the Committee considered that it would be unreasonable to grant legal aid to enable him to continue to pursue a claim so long as he remained “a fugitive from justice already meted out to you”. 25. His solicitors again applied for the release of the monies to fund his litigation which application was rejected by the Court of Appeal. 26. The Court of Appeal hearing took place on 6 and 7 October 1997. The applicant was neither represented nor present and the Publisher took no part in the proceedings. The AG was represented by the Solicitor-General, Queen's Counsel and two junior counsel, with a Queen's Counsel and one junior counsel appearing as amici curiae. The Court of Appeal later noted that the amici curiae had deployed before it all the arguments which the applicant might have wished to present if he had been present. 27. Counsel acting as amici curiae suggested a possible public law remedy and the court also considered that the AG might have a private law restitutionary remedy against the applicant. The proceedings were therefore adjourned (until 1 December 1997) to allow submissions on those two issues as defined by the court. The AG was also granted leave to amend his statement of claim. Arrangements were made for the applicant to be sent the amended statement of claim. He did not respond because, he submitted, he was not legally represented. 28. On 16 December 1997 Lord Woolf M.R. delivered the court's judgment dismissing the three private law grounds of appeal (breach of a life-long fiduciary duty arising from S.I.S. employment; breach of contract given the undertaking signed in 1944; and a claim for restitutionary damages for profits from a breach of contract where the defendant obtained profit by doing the very thing which he contracted not to do). The Crown's public law claim (the AG's inherent power to bring proceedings to ensure the enforcement of the criminal law) was allowed. Accordingly, Lord Woolf M.R. granted an injunction restraining the applicant from receiving any payment or other benefit in connection with the exploitation of the Book 29. On 24 January 1998 the applicant's solicitors sought leave to be reinstated and, acting on a pro bono basis, lodged skeleton arguments before the Court of Appeal seeking leave to appeal to the House of Lords. On 28 January 1998 the applicant's representatives went back on record. On 22 April 1998 the Court of Appeal gave leave to appeal. On 24 April 1998 the applicant requested waiver of security for costs and the Treasury Solicitor confirmed consent on 24 June 1998. 30. On 24 June 1998 the House of Lords allowed the filing of the appeal petition out of time. On 30 July 1998 the applicant again applied for the release of the monies held by the Publisher, which was refused by the Treasury Solicitor on 25 August 1998. His request to the House of Lords for the release of monies was made on 15 October 1998 and was rejected in November 1998, the House of Lords advising him to apply for a waiver of the appeal fees. The applicant submitted that between November 1998 and May 1999 he corresponded with the Legal Aid Area Office concerning funding for the appeal to the House of Lords. On 5 June 1999 the applicant returned the completed waiver request form and on 25 June 1999 the applicant's solicitors applied for the waiver of appeal fees. On 2 July 1999 the House of Lords requested further information of the applicant as regards the waiver application. Between 7 and 20 July the applicant and the Treasury Solicitor agreed on a statement of facts for the purposes of the appeal. In or around late 1999/early 2000 the House of Lords agreed to waive the appeal fees and security for costs. The expenses (not including legal costs) of preparing the hearing bundles for the House of Lords amounted to GBP 2,709. His solicitor and junior counsel represented him on a pro bono basis. Two Queen's Counsel and two junior counsel represented the Crown. 31. The appeal hearing was fixed for 7-9 March 2000. Although he accepted that the restitutionary damages' (private law) issue raised points of general interest, the AG confined the appeal to the public law injunction. However, by letter dated 14 February 2000 to the parties, the House of Lords indicated that it wished to hear argument at the hearing on the matter of restitutionary damages for breach of contract. Both parties prepared written submissions on the point and a hearing took place between 7 and 9 March 2000. 32. The main judgment was delivered on 27 July 2000 by Lord Nicholls, with whom Lords Goff and Browne-Wilkinson concurred. Lord Steyn delivered a separate judgment and Lord Hobhouse dissented. Lord Nicholls concluded that there was no reason in principle to rule out an account of profits as a remedy for breach of contract in exceptional situations notably where other remedies were inadequate and where the plaintiff had a legitimate interest in preventing the defendant's profit-making activity and, hence, in depriving him of his profit. The final basis for making an order for an account of profits was the applicant's breach of contract and, in particular, the undertaking of confidentiality signed in 1944. However, that did not confer on the Crown any proprietary interest in the debt due to the applicant from the Publisher. The Crown was entitled, on the taking of the account, to a money judgment which could then be enforced by attachment of the debt in the usual way. Given that the Publisher who held the monies wished to deduct its legal expenses in defending the third party proceedings, the appropriate form of order was a declaration that the AG was entitled to be paid a sum equal to whatever amount was due and owing to the applicant under the publishing agreement of 4 May 1989. The injunction would remain in force until the Publisher made payment to the AG. 33. The applicant remained in Russia for the duration of the proceedings.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

RUSSIA,3,Violation of Art. 10;Pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage - award,Anatoly Kovler;Christos Rozakis;Dean Spielmann;George Nicolaou;Khanlar Hajiyev;Sverre Erik Jebens,"4. The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in the village of Suponevo, in the Bryansk Region. 5. The applicant has been the editor of a weekly newspaper, Bryanskiye Budni (Брянские будни), since he founded it in 1999. 6. In 2003 a leaflet was distributed in Bryansk and the Bryansk Region concerning a member of parliament (MP), Mr Shandybin, who was going to stand in the forthcoming elections. The leaflet read as follows: “Enough of telling fairy tales!!! Let us turn to the facts! Read the Israeli weekly newspaper Beseder. The fortune of the member of the State Duma Vasiliy Shandybin is estimated by the newspaper at 13,123,400 dollars!! You do not believe it? Where does the money come from??? Vasiliy Shandybin charges 1,000 US dollars for a letter with the letterhead of a member of the State Duma, and 5,000 dollars for an MP's inquiry concerning a delicate matter!!! Lobbying on behalf of Vladimir Bryntsalov's interests in the State Duma – 300,000 dollars per year. The profit from trading in medicines and from the sale of overpriced medicines to the Bryansk Region – 600,000 dollars per year. Vote for our fellow countryman Vasiliy Shandybin and you will surely turn him into a billionaire!!!” 7. The leaflet was either quoted or its contents were described in a number of newspapers including Desnyanskaya Pravda (Деснянская правда) of 8 October 2003 and Komsomolets Bryanska (Комсомолец Брянска) of 14 October 2003 and internet news sites, including posts on www.news.nashbryansk.ru, www.gazeta.ru, www.vlasti.net and www.sem40.ru of 3 October 2003, a post on www.sobesednik.ru of unspecified date in October 2002 and a post on www.globalrus.ru of 20 October 2003. The applicant has provided copies of the newspaper articles and printouts from the internet sites. 8. On 9 October 2003 in Bryanskiye Budni no. 206 (no. 41) the applicant published an article entitled “Vasya and Israel” (“Вася и Израиль”). The article reads as follows: “Vasya was slandered. Ivanych. Shandybin. The hand reaches for an axe. Revenge! For our workers' conscience! The circulation of the leaflet distributed through towns and villages, according to Vasiliy himself and his associates, is half a million copies, and it says that Shandybin scraped up a fortune of more than 13 million dollars. An angry rebuff of this allegation was made by the Bryanskaya Pravda. He did not take it, says Pravda, Bryntsalov did not chuck him 300,000 dollars for assistance in the sale of medicines either, and 5,000 bucks for an MP's inquiry is unheard of. Actually, when we are talking about Vasya, it is appropriate to say that one should not look a gift horse in the mouth. Vasya gave medical equipment as a present to two outpatient clinics, and it is impossible to count how many music boxes he gave to schools and orphans' homes. It is clearly improper to ask the donor where he got the money for all these goods. The benefactors paid for Shandybin's pretty haircut, and he justly distributed the catch among those in need. If there are doubts, they are caused by the unsightly history of Russian 'parliamentarism'. Recently, in connection with the events of 1993, we were reminded how cynically Yeltsin bought MPs who had not yet decided which side of the barricades to run to. He promised them a rich piece of cake, and they slyly ran for this piece, swallowing their spittle. Zhirinovskiy's party was accused of bribery many times, but all our elected representatives take [bribes] (except Vasya, of course), if we mean not only money but also greyhound puppies: favours from Western patrons, from Khodorkovskiys or Abramovichs residing in Russia. And this is a serious school, a school of venality. This is why the accusation against Shandybin in the clandestine leaflet fell on fertile ground. Whether Vasiliy Ivanovich took bribes or not, he will have to account for all his colleagues, for the fact that he has sat next to venal MPs in the venal Duma for many years. In a way, the retribution is legitimate. Who is the author? He is closer to the body of Vasiliy Ivanovich than the MP himself thinks. Of course, the easiest answer is: the one who intends to stand against him in the same electoral district. We have no doubts that Vasya's ill-wishers from this camp will scribble too, but the leaflet containing a reference to the Israeli source was in fact made in a different camp. Which one? Remember who recently visited Israel. Thus, nominally these forces are Shandybin's allies, but effectively they consider him a serf. And serfs need to be reminded from which barn they originate, so that they do not put on airs and are obedient. Unfortunately, Shandybin is looking for ill-wishers in the wrong camp. They should be searched for among the people who cover themselves with red rags. Their handwriting is recognisable. Their latest provocation in the press was, in fact, a supplement to Bryanskiye Budni. They published a fake edition of Budni that criticised the opposition to Lodkin, inter alia, to test their undercover printing works. Although the editors lodged an official complaint, the law-enforcement authorities did not try to find the publisher. And now here is a new volley, and surely not the last one, from the underground regional committee [of the Communist Party].” 9. On 15 October 2003 the Election Committee of the Bryansk Region issued a decree declaring that the applicant's article was intended to agitate the electorate and to encourage a negative attitude towards Mr Shandybin. The applicant appealed to a court against the decree. 10. On 26 November 2003 the Bryansk Regional Court found that the decree was unlawful. The court held: “...[T]he article was published on 9 October 2003 ... before the election campaign had started ... [T]he article contains information about the distribution of a leaflet saying that V.I. Shandybin had made a fortune of more than 13 million dollars, and speculations by the author concerning the existence of this money and its sources. The contents of the leaflet are not quoted in the article. The text of the article contains neither information about the forthcoming elections to the State Duma ..., about V.I. Shandybin as a candidate for the State Duma, his political views and ideas, nor agitational calls to vote for or against V.I. Shandybin or other candidates. ... [Mr] Fedchenko stated at the hearing that in the article he had not sought to agitate but had merely stated his opinion concerning the distributed leaflet and the information contained therein. The [defendant] did not produce any proof to the contrary ...” 11. The Election Committee of the Bryansk Region appealed. 12. On 18 February 2004 the Supreme Court of Russia upheld the judgment. 13. On 20 October 2003 Mr Shandybin brought an action for defamation against the applicant in the Bryanskiy District Court of the Bryansk Region and sought damages in the amount of 500,000 Russian roubles (RUB). He claimed, in particular, that the following passages were untrue and damaging to his honour and reputation: “Shandybin scraped up a fortune of more than 13 million dollars.” “He did not take it, says Pravda, Bryntsalov did not chuck him 300,000 dollars for assistance in the sale of medicines either, and 5,000 bucks for an MP's inquiry is unheard of.” “Thus, nominally these forces are Shandybin's allies, but effectively they consider him a serf. And serfs need to be reminded from which barn they originate, so that they do not put on airs and are obedient.” 14. On 31 May 2004 the Bryanskiy District Court found for the claimant. The court held: “...[T]he article Vasya and Israel as a whole, as well as particular phrases and words (the subject of the dispute) in it, are strongly indicative of a negative judgment and contain direct emotional judgments which constitute insulting attacks and indirect judgments. ...[T]he [first] assertion as such, in the context of the article, is insulting, and damaging to the honour and dignity of the claimant and ... to his reputation. The defendant failed to prove the contrary. The claim is well-founded. ...The author ironically uses [slang words] in the [second] assertion so as to give it a cynical, insulting character and describes the claimant in negative terms. The assertion is beyond the limits of civilised communication and is in breach of moral standards. Accordingly, the claimant's assertion ... concerning the disparaging character of the above quotation is well-founded. ...The [third] assertion has an emotionally expressive tone of contempt and humiliation and presents the [MP] to the readers in a negative light, as a person capable of doing bad things for society. If used metaphorically, the words are disapproving in tone. The claimant has grounds to perceive the assertions as insulting and slanderous. The court considers this information damaging to the honour, dignity and reputation of the claimant.” 15. The court held the applicant liable for RUR 5,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage sustained by the claimant. The applicant was also ordered to provide Mr Shandybin with an opportunity to publish his response in Bryanskiye Budni. The applicant appealed. 16. On 1 July 2004 the Bryansk Regional Court reversed the judgment in the part relating to the publication of the claimant's response in Bryanskiye Budni and upheld it in the remaining part. The court found that since Mr Shandybin had not applied directly to Bryanskiye Budni for the publication of the response within a year of the publication of the defaming information, under Sections 45 and 46 of the Law on Mass Media he was estopped from applying to a court in this respect. The court further held: “On the basis of the evidence described in the judgment the [first-instance] court reached the correct conclusion that the assertions at issue did not correspond to the truth and discredited the honour, dignity and reputation of the claimant.” 17. Article 29 guarantees freedom of thought and expression, together with freedom of the mass media. 18. Article 152 provides that an individual may apply to a court with a request for the rectification of information (сведения) that is damaging to his honour, dignity or professional reputation unless the disseminator of that information proves that it “corresponds to reality” (Paragraph 1). The defamatory information must be refuted in the same media source that disseminated it (Paragraph 2). The aggrieved person also has a right to publish a response in the same media source (Paragraph 3). He may also claim compensation for losses and non-pecuniary damage sustained as a result of the dissemination of the information (Paragraph 5). 19. Under Section 45 of the Law on Mass Media no. 2124-I of 27 December 1991 a media source may refuse to publish a response to defamatory information if the aggrieved person did not apply for the publication of the response within a year of the publication of the defamatory information. Under Section 46 a refusal to publish a response may be appealed against to a court within a year of the publication of the defamatory information. 20. The Resolution (in force at the material time) provided that, in order to be considered damaging, information (сведения) had to be untrue and contain allegations of a breach of laws or moral principles (commission of a dishonest act, improper behaviour at the workplace or in everyday life, etc.). Dissemination of such information was understood as the publication of the information or its broadcasting, inclusion in professional references, public speeches, applications to State officials and communication in other forms, including oral, to at least one other person (Section 2). The burden of proof was on the defendant to show that the disseminated information had been true and accurate (Section 7).",['10'],[],[],[],[],[],1

On 2 March 2000 the applicant was first questioned by the police on suspicion of offences in relation to his business activities. The last questioning of the applicant took place on 26 June 2001. 6. The first pre-trial investigation reports were completed and sent to the public prosecutor on 25 October 2000, 4 December 2000 and 4 October 2001. The last pre-trial investigation report was submitted to the prosecutor on 16 November 2004. 7. On 22 December 2004 the prosecutor, who according to the Government had decided to join the cases concerning the applicant, preferred charges against him at the District Court. The court held a preliminary hearing on 16 November 2005 and later an oral hearing over a number of days. The applicant was heard before the court for the first time on 12 January 2006. 8. On 12 April 2006 the District Court issued its judgment with regard to the applicant and 24 other defendants in 11 cases which had been joined. The applicant was convicted of aggravated tax fraud and other economic offences and sentenced to one year and two months’ imprisonment. Jointly with other defendants, he was also ordered to pay some EUR 89,000 with interest to the tax authorities. 9. In its reasoning the District Court stated that the majority of the criminal acts in respect of all defendants had been committed in 1998 and 1999. The bulk of cases had been lodged with the court on 22 December 2004. The last application for a summons in the joined cases had been filed with the court on 27 July 2005. The court noted that the case concerned particularly wide-ranging economic crimes. The examination of the cases needed to be joined due to the connections between different companies and persons involved. For that reason the court, in sentencing the defendants, took into account only to a lesser degree the time that had elapsed since the commission of the criminal acts and the length of the proceedings as mitigating circumstances. The amount of reduction in the respective sentences was not specified by the court. As regarded the applicant, the court also took into account his previous community service and noted that he had committed the crimes partly while on probation. 10. On 27 November 2007, having held an oral hearing, the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal, including his complaint concerning the length of the proceedings. 11. On 31 March 2008 the Supreme Court refused leave to appeal.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicants were born in 1979 and 1973 respectively and were detained in Malatya prison at the time of the lodging of their applications with the Court. 7. On 1 November 2001 the applicants were arrested and taken into police custody on suspicion of their involvement in the activities of the PKK (The Kurdistan Workers’ Party). On 9 November 2001 the Tunceli Magistrates’ Court ordered their remand in custody. 8. The public prosecutor at the Malatya State Security Court in his indictment, dated 7 December 2001, accused the first applicant of membership of the PKK and the second applicant of aiding and abetting that organisation. The charges were brought under Articles 168 and 169 of the Criminal Code and Article 5 of Law no. 3713. 9. On 10 September 2002 the Malatya State Security Court convicted the applicants as charged and sentenced the first applicant to twelve years and six months’ imprisonment and the second applicant to three years and nine months’ imprisonment and a fine of 177,957,000 Turkish liras. 10. The parties did not submit any documents pertaining to the outcome of the criminal proceedings. However, in their submissions on just satisfaction, dated 21 July 2005, the applicants stated that the Malatya State Security Court, pursuant to Law no. 4959 of 29 July 2003 on rehabilitation (topluma kazandırma), had decided not to sentence the applicants (ceza tertibi) and suspended the proceedings. They further submitted that this decision was upheld by the Court of Cassation. 11. A description of the relevant domestic law at the material time can be found in Daş v.

The applicant was born in 1961 and is serving a prison sentence in correctional colony IK-3 in the Bashkortostan Republic. 7. On 14 September 1998 the applicant was arrested in the town of Glazov on suspicion of murder and several robberies. He was searched and police officers allegedly withheld his money and jewellery and beat him up. They took him to Glazov town police station where the beatings allegedly continued. 8. On an unspecified date the applicant was charged with aggravated robbery, murder, unlawful detention of an individual, extortion, unlawful possession of firearms and use of force against a State official – offences under Articles 162, 105, 127, 163, 222 and 318 of the Criminal Code. The applicant was placed in custody. 9. On 12 October 1999 the Supreme Court of the Udmurtiya Republic found the applicant guilty of robbery committed with a view to acquiring others' property on a large scale and accompanied by infliction of grievous bodily harm on the victim (Article 162 § (b) and (c)); unlawful detention of a person entailing grave consequences (Article 127 § 3); murder with a lucrative aim accompanied by a robbery (Article 105 § 2 (i)); extortion aimed at acquisition of others' property on a large scale (Article 163 § 3 (b)); unlawful possession of a firearm (Article 222 § 1) and assault on a State official (Article 318 § 1). The court established that the applicant had instigated his two co-defendants to rob employees of a trading company. Accompanied by the co-defendants and carrying a firearm, the applicant had stopped the employees' car, had robbed them, tied them to a tree in the forest and shot one of them dead. The court further found that the applicant had blackmailed another victim, extorting a sum of money from him and had assaulted police officers during his arrest. The court based the applicant's conviction on testimonies by his co-defendants, the surviving victims and witnesses and the material evidence. The applicant was sentenced to twenty-three years' imprisonment. He appealed against the judgment. 10. On an unspecified date in May 2000 the applicant was transferred to remand centre SIZO-3 in Moscow in order to secure his presence at the appeal hearing. He was allegedly placed in a cell where he was severely beaten by other inmates. 11. On 4 October 2000 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation upheld the applicant's conviction on appeal. 12. On 16 April 2001 a deputy Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation lodged with the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation an application for supervisory review of the judgments of 12 October 1999 and 4 October 2000. The prosecutor requested a different legal characterisation of the applicant's criminal acts, in particular that the charge of “unlawful detention of an individual by an organised group” under Article 127 § 3 of the Criminal Code be reclassified as “unlawful detention of two or more individuals by a group of persons with the use of weapons and violence dangerous to [their] health” under Article 127 § 2 (a), (c), (d) and (h). Furthermore, he requested that the charge of “murder for financial gain coupled with robbery” under Article 105 § 2 (i) be reclassified as “murder coupled with robbery” under the same provision. 13. According to the Government, a copy of the prosecutor's application was sent to the applicant “simultaneously” and on 27 July 2001 he was informed that the hearing before the Presidium was scheduled for 8 August 2001. They further submitted that the applicant had been subsequently notified that the hearing had been postponed. The copy of the application of the deputy Prosecutor General produced by the Government contained handwritten notes: “postponed [signature] 08.08.”, “postponed [signature] 23.05”, “postponed 27.06.2001 [signature]”. 14. According to the applicant, he obtained a copy of the deputy Prosecutor General's application only on 16 August 2001. On unspecified dates the applicant sent to the Prosecutor General's Office and the Presidium of the Supreme Court his observations in connection with the prosecutor's application. He also sought leave to appear at the supervisory review hearing. It appears that his requests were left without reply. 15. On 3 October 2001 the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation examined the application. After having heard the prosecutor and the judge rapporteur and examined the materials of the case, the Presidium granted the request, reclassified the applicant's acts as sought by the prosecutor and reduced the sentence to twenty-two years' imprisonment. The Presidium court's decision contained no reference to the applicant's observations or arguments raised therein. The applicant did not attend the hearing. 16. From 6 April to 16 October 2005 the applicant was held in colony LIU-2 in the Udmurtiya Republic. 17. On 5 May 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government of the Russian Federation. 18. By a letter dated 20 May 2005 and sent through informal channels, the applicant informed the Court that on 16 May 2005 wardens Ch., Ya. and O. had had a conversation with him. According to the applicant, they told him that the Court had started its examination of the application lodged by Messrs Khyzhiny and that they did not want the applicant to complain about conditions of detention in Russian correctional colonies to the Strasbourg Court. They ordered him to write statements addressed to Mr Zheludov, head of the Federal Service of the Execution of Sentences in the Republic of Udmurtiya, and to Mr Mardanshin, a prosecutor. The applicant was to affirm that he had no complaints about the conditions of detention. The applicant refused and allegedly endured beatings for three days and received death threats. According to the applicant, there was no physical evidence of ill-treatment because he had been refused access to a doctor. On 19 May 2005 the applicant gave up and signed the declarations. 19. In his letter of 20 May 2005 he requested the Court not to accept any statement similar to the above, should the Government produce one. 20. By a letter of 10 May 2005 the Registry of the Court informed the applicant that notice of his application had been given to the Russian Government. The applicant was invited to designate a representative in the proceedings before the Court. The letter contained several enclosures, such as a statement of facts, questions to the parties, an information note to applicants on the proceedings after communication of an application, an authority form and a list of Russian bar associations to which the applicant could apply for representation before the Court. 21. By letter dated 30 May 2005 the applicant informed the Court that on 26 May 2005 a co-detainee had handed him the Registry's letter of 10 May 2005. The envelope had been unsealed. It contained the letter and the questions to the parties. Considering that certain documents were missing, the applicant requested the prison administration to explain why the letter had been opened. According to the applicant, on 26 May 2006 he had been placed for four months in so-called “PKT cell-type premises” [помещение камерного типа] with a stricter prison regime because of his questions. 22. On 27 June 2005 the applicant complained of censorship to the head of the colony who initiated an inquiry. 23. On 27 June 2005 officer Z. submitted to the head of the colony an explanation which, in its relevant parts, read as follows: “I hereby notify you that on 25 May 2005 a letter (incoming no. 1324) in a foreign language for convict Tarasov [the applicant] was received. I examined [the letter]. The documents in the envelope were inspected and put back into the envelope; they were not withheld. Other persons did not have access to the above letter and on the same day it was handed over against receipt to Kh., head of the brigade...” 24. The explanation compiled on 1 July 2005 by Kh., head of the applicant's brigade, went on as follows: “On 25 May 2005 at around 3 p.m. officer Z. handed over to me a big envelope addressed to [the applicant]. The envelope was opened, I examined [рассмотрел] the documents contained therein and put them back. There were no documents in Russian there. I gave the envelope to V., the inmate on duty, for him to pass it to [the applicant]. I did not remove any documents from the envelope and did not give them to persons other than V.” 25. On 29 June 2005 inmate V. submitted to the head of the colony an explanation worded in the following terms: “I ... handed over to [the applicant] a big envelope which had been given to me by Kh., head of the brigade. Some fifteen minutes after the envelope was given to me I handed it over to [the applicant]. I did not look into the envelope and did not take any documents out of it, I did not give the envelope to anybody.” 26. On 4 July 2005 the acting head of the colony delivered a report [заключение]. It stated that in course of the inquiry it had been established that on 25 May 2005 the colony had received an envelope for the applicant with documents from the European Court. Officer Z. in charge of censoring the inmates' correspondence had automatically opened the envelope, not noticing the logo of the European Court of Human Rights. After the inspection [осмотр] of the documents she had put them back into the envelope and had passed it over to Kh., head of the applicant's brigade, who was supposed to hand it over to the applicant. The report concluded that Z. had breached Article 91 § 2 of the Penal Code prohibiting censorship of convicts' correspondence with the European Court of Human Rights. The report went on suggesting, among other things, reprimanding Z. for negligence and conducting study courses on Article 91 of the Penal Code with the colony officers, followed by obligatory tests. 27. On 2 September 2005 the Court requested the Government to submit further observations in connection with the censorship of the Registry's letter and the alleged intimidation of the applicant. 28. On an unspecified date the regional office of the Federal Service for the Execution of Sentences in the Republic of Udmurtiya opened an inquiry in connection with the Court's communication of the applicant's complaints to the Government. 29. On 25 October 2005 the regional prosecutor questioned the applicant. His explanation, in so far as relevant, read: “On 26 May 2005 at around 12.10 on duty inmate V. handed over to me an opened envelope with the logo of the ECHR; there were three sheets of paper with a text in English. He told me that he had received the envelope from Kh.. At lunch I asked Kh. why the envelope had been opened. He answered that he had been given the opened envelope by the censor... From the text of the documents I understood that not all documents had been given to me; in particular, some documents which I was supposed to fill in and to return to the ECHR were missing... I think that the missing documents... had been withheld by the representatives of the administration of LIU-2. I cannot name specific persons because I don't know who they were. My suspicions in respect of the administration are based on the fact that directly after my complaint to Ya., deputy head of the colony, the administration acted in a strange way. Instead of attempting to find out what had happened to the missing documents, they placed me in a PKT. I think that if the administration had had nothing to do with the loss of the documents they would not be acting like that... ...In LIU-2 I was not pressurised directly. However it looks suspicious to me that I have suddenly become a persistent regime breaker. It is also alarming that measures are taken with a view to delaying my incoming correspondence from the ECHR and my outgoing correspondence. The attachments to the ECHR letter opened in May 2005 may have been withheld with this aim.” 30. On 1 November 2005 the regional office of the Federal Service for Execution of Sentences issued a report in which they acknowledged a breach of the rules concerning the confidentiality of the applicant's correspondence with the Court. At the same time it was noted that it had not been confirmed that documents had been removed from the Registry's envelope. It was further stated, with reference to the explanations of Z., the then acting head of the colony, and Kh., that Z. had automatically opened the envelope, that she had not read the documents and that, in any event, she did not speak English. Had she noticed the European Court's logo, she would not have unsealed the envelope. Neither she nor other persons had removed the documents from the envelope; no such directions had ever been given to anybody. It had been impossible to reprimand Z. because by the relevant time her employment had already been terminated because of general measures to reduce the workforce. 31. As regards the applicant's allegation of pressure with a view to making him withdraw some of his complaints to the Court, the report noted that, according to his own explanation, he had only raised the issue of interference with his communication with the Court in connection with the opening of the Registry's letter. He had not referred to any other instances of intimidation or interference. 32. Lastly, during his detention before his conviction had become final he had been reprimanded fourteen times for various breaches of the detention regime. After the conviction had become final the applicant breached the prison regime on twenty-seven occasions: he was placed in a punishment cell, nine times, in a PKT twice, and was reprimanded seventeen times. 33. By a final judgment of 15 December 2006 the applicant was convicted of having publicly assaulted a public official. 34. On an unspecified date he was transferred to serve his prison sentence to correctional colony IK-3 in the Republic of Bashkortostan. 35. On 12 September 2005 the Court, while giving notice of the applicant's complaints about the opening of its letter and the applicant's alleged intimidation under Article 34, of its own motion, raised the issue of whether the prison authorities censored the applicant's correspondence, in breach of Article 8 of the Convention. 36. According to the applicant, during his stay in LIU-2 the prison administration routinely censored his incoming mail from the domestic authorities that was not subject to censorship by virtue of the domestic law. 37. In particular, the applicant referred to the incoming mail from the following authorities: the Ombudsman of the Russian Federation (letters of 6 June and 14 October 2004), the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation (letter of 26 August 1999), the Commission on Human Rights with the President of the Russian Federation (letter of 15 April 2004), the Prosecutor General's Office (letters of 11 November 2002 and 27 October 2005), the prosecutor's office of the Udmurtiya Republic (letters of 3 December 2002 and 11 May 2004), the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation (letter of 31 October 2002), the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation (letter of 20 November 2002), the department of the Federal Service for Execution of Sentences in the Udmurtiya Republic (letters of 26 April, 3 and 10 June and 10 August 2004), the Mozhgi District court (letter of 13 January 2004). 38. The letter of the Prosecutor General's Office dated 27 October 2005 was addressed to the head of LIU-2. He was requested to notify the applicant that the Prosecutor General's Office had examined the applicant's complaint, forwarded to them by the Office of the President of the Russian Federation, and dismissed it as unfounded. 39. Under Article 377 § 3 of the 1960 Code of Criminal Procedure, in force at the material time, a prosecutor took part in a hearing before a supervisory review court. A convict and his or her counsel could be summoned if the court found it necessary. If summoned, they were to be afforded an opportunity to take cognisance of the application for supervisory review and to make oral submissions at the hearing. By its ruling of 14 February 2000, the Constitutional Court declared Article 377 § 3 of the Code unconstitutional in so far as it allowed a supervisory instance court to examine the case without providing the convicted or acquitted person and their counsel with an opportunity to know the contents of the request for supervisory review lodged by the prosecutor, if the latter sought annulment of the final judgment on grounds unfavourable to that person. The Constitutional Court made the same findings in respect of the lack of a legal requirement to notify the convicted or acquitted person and their counsel of the time when and place where the supervisory review hearing would take place. Failing that, the above persons would be unable to state their position to the court. 40. A supervisory review court was not bound by the scope of the application for supervisory review and was under an obligation to review the criminal case in its entirety (Article 380). It could uphold, amend or quash any of the earlier judgments, vary the sentence, discontinue the criminal proceedings or remit the matter for new consideration by the trial or appeal court. It could not, however, increase the sentence or re-categorise the defendant's actions as a more serious offence (ibid.). 41. Article 91 § 2 of the Penal Code, as amended on 8 December 2003, as well as Rule 53 of the Internal Regulations of Correctional Facilities adopted on 3 November 2005 by Decree no. 205 of the Russian Ministry of Justice, provide that all detainees' incoming and outgoing correspondence is subject to censorship by the administration of the correctional facility. Correspondence with courts, prosecutors, penitentiary officials, the Ombudsman, the public monitoring board and the European Court of Human Rights is not subject to censorship.","['6', '8']",['6-1'],[],['34'],[],[],1

The first applicant is the mother of the second applicant. The applicants were born in Slovakia in 1960 and 1981, respectively, and now live outside Slovakia. They both have Slovakian nationality and the nationality of the country of their permanent residence. 9. In 1985 the Bratislava 4 District Court (then Obvodný súd, at present Okresný súd) pronounced the first applicant’s divorce from Mr P., the biological father of the second applicant. The second applicant was entrusted to the care and custody of the first applicant. 10. In 1993 the first applicant married Mr O.A.M. abroad and the applicants set up their permanent residence with him there. 11. On 8 January 1996 Mrs O., the mother of the first applicant, filed an action with the Dunajská Streda District Court claiming that she should be granted the right to educate the second applicant, her granddaughter. At that time the second applicant was fourteen years old and both applicants were in Slovakia on a temporary stay. Mr P. later joined the proceedings on the side of Mrs O. 12. On 14 February 1996 the District Court appointed the Veľký Meder District Office (Okresný úrad) to look after the second applicant’s interests in the proceedings. 13. On 19 February 1996 the first applicant made several submissions to the District Court. She asserted that she and the second applicant were permanently residing outside Slovakia and that, in addition to Slovakian nationality, they also had the nationality of the country of their permanent residence. As they were staying in Slovakia only temporarily, the Slovakian courts had no jurisdiction to entertain the question of the education and care of the second applicant. The first applicant further expressed critical views as to the character of Mrs O. and Mr P. Finally, she lodged an appeal against the decision of 14 February 1996 arguing that officials of the District Office had previously failed to represent the second applicant’s interests adequately and that they could not be expected to do so properly in the future. 14. In April and May 1996 the first applicant sought to disqualify the judge dealing with the case as well as all other judges of the District Court on grounds of bias. The hearing scheduled for 13 May 1996 had therefore to be adjourned and the casefile was submitted to the Trnava Regional Court (Krajský súd) for a decision on the challenge. 15. On 27 May 1996 the first applicant filed a petition with the Bratislava Regional Court claiming that Mr P. should be deprived of his parental rights over the second applicant. According to the applicants, no decision has ever been taken in respect of this request. 16. On 31 May 1996 the District Office issued an interim measure ordering that the second applicant be temporarily placed in the care of Mrs O. The applicants claim that this measure was illegal and that it has never been served officially on them. The first applicant subsequently returned with the second applicant to their home abroad. 17. On 11 July 1996 the Trnava Regional Court sent the casefile back to the District Court instructing it to invite the first applicant to indicate which judges of the District Court she was challenging and why. Subsequently the police informed the District Court that the applicants had left Slovakia in June 1996. 18. On 26 August 1996 Mrs O. requested that the District Court issue an interim measure granting her the custody of the second applicant pending the outcome of the proceedings. The applicants have never been made officially aware of this request. 19. The casefile was again sent to the Trnava Regional Court in September 1996. The Regional Court decided that the District Court’s judges were not biased and, on 18 October 1996, returned the casefile to the latter. 20. The District Court held a hearing on 28 November 1996. 21. Following their arrival for another temporary stay in Slovakia, the District Court heard the first applicant and Mr O.A.M. on 5 December 1996 and the second applicant on 10 December 1996. 22. On 18 December 1996 the case was adjourned and on 19 December 1996 the District Court dismissed Mrs O.’s request of 26 August 1996 for an interim measure. The District Court did so observing that the applicants were living in Slovakia at that time and that, when questioned on 10 December 1996, the second applicant had expressed the wish to stay with the first applicant. The applicants maintain that at that time they were staying in Slovakia only temporarily. 23. On 14 January 1997 the first applicant filed a petition with the Dunajská Streda District Court in which she again claimed that Mr P. should be deprived of his parental rights over the second applicant. 24. On 16 January 1997 the District Court heard witnesses and on 30 January 1997 it appointed an expert in psychology to draw up a report on the second applicant. The latter filed an appeal against this decision. 25. On 3 February 1997 the District Court appointed the Dunajská Streda District Office to look after the second applicant’s interests in the proceedings. The applicants maintain that they have never been notified of the appointment. 26. On 13 February 1997 the expert informed the District Court that she was not in a position to produce the report because of a heavy workload. 27. The hearing called for 18 February 1997 had to be adjourned as the first applicant and Mr P. failed to appear. The District Court ordered that the District Office look into the upbringing environment of the second applicant and the personal and material situation of the first applicant and Mr P. 28. Mr P. requested that an interim measure be issued to prevent the second applicant from travelling abroad without his consent. On 21 February 1997 the District Court dismissed the request. 29. At a hearing held on 6 March 1997 the District Court heard the parties and a representative of the Dunajská Streda District Office. The first applicant was fined for disturbing the orderly conduct of the hearing by, as the applicants claim, objecting to the truthfulness of the testimony given by Mr P. The case was then adjourned and Mr P. was invited to submit documentary evidence. 30. On 7 March 1997 the first applicant filed an appeal “against all decisions” delivered by the District Court judge dealing with the case. 31. On 10 March 1997 Mr P. appealed against the decision of 21 February 1997. He also claimed that his right to meet the second applicant be determined by the court. 32. On 20 March 1997 the first applicant requested that further documentary evidence be taken. 33. On 27 March 1997 Mr O.A.M. lodged a request for adoption of the second applicant. It was his third request to this effect after he had withdrawn two similar requests made previously on 31 January and 19 February 1996. 34. On 13 May 1997 the District Court submitted the casefile to the Trnava Regional Court for a decision on the appeals filed by the parties. On 23 June 1996 the Regional Court returned the casefile to the District Court instructing it to ensure that the first applicant eliminated formal shortcomings in her appeal of 7 March 1997. 35. On 28 July 1997 the Trnava Regional Court dismissed the second applicant’s appeal against the decision of 30 January 1997 concerning the appointment of an expert and quashed the above District Court’s decision of 21 February 1997. 36. On 8 September and 6 October 1997 the District Court inquired of the first applicant’s father about the applicants’ whereabouts. On 15 September and 23 October 1997 he replied that the applicants were currently staying abroad where they had left on 6 May 1997. According to the applicants, they had left Slovakia on 23 April 1997 and were not present there until 6 May 1997. 37. From November 1997 to January 1998 the court attempted several times to establish the address of the applicants in the country of their residence. The police notified the address to the District Court on 29 January 1998. 38. On 24 February 1998, while both applicants were abroad, the District Court issued an interim measure prohibiting them inter alia from leaving Slovakia. On 25 March 1998 Mr O.A.M. appealed against this decision. The first applicant, Mrs O. and Mr P. also appealed. 39. On 14 April 1998 the casefile was submitted to the President of the Trnava Regional Court who returned the file on 7 May 1998. 40. On 8 July 1998, after having taken several procedural steps, the District Court resubmitted the casefile to the Trnava Regional Court for a determination of the appeals against the decision of 24 February 1998. 41. On 26 August 1998 the Trnava Regional Court quashed the District Court’s decision to the extent that it prohibited the applicants from travelling abroad and dismissed the request of Mr P. for an interim measure to this effect. The casefile was returned to the District Court on 4 September 1998. On 11 November 1998 and on 10 March 1999 the District Court judge arranged for service of the Regional Court’s decision on the parties. 42. In the meantime, on 28 October 1998, the first applicant had requested that further evidence be taken. 43. The District Court judge dealing with the case was ill for a considerable period between August 1998 and January 1999 and also between March and May 1999. 44. On 21 April 1999, on the complaint of Mrs O., the Constitutional Court found that her constitutional right to a hearing without unjustified delay had been violated in the above proceedings. In its decision the Constitutional Court admitted that, to a certain extent, the length of the proceedings was due to the behaviour of the parties. However, the case was not particularly complex and what was at stake in the proceedings called for particular diligence. The Constitutional Court further noted that the District Court had caused undue delays in the proceedings by failing to decide in a timely manner on the request for an interim measure restricting the applicants’ travel abroad, thus bringing about the need for the assistance of foreign authorities. Furthermore, by the time of the Constitutional Court’s decision the District Court judge had not yet prepared the request for assistance that was to be sent to these authorities. 45. The Constitutional Court further observed that the District Court had not proceeded with the case effectively in that it had failed to take evidence, including an expert opinion, required for a decision on the case. Delays in the proceedings had also arisen as a result of the ordinary courts’ failure to decide on the requests for interim measures within the statutory timelimit. Finally, the Constitutional Court noted that the District Court had failed to take any effective action in the case since 4 September 1998. 46. The applicants were not informed of the above proceedings before the Constitutional Court, did not take part in them and only learned of their outcome once the proceedings were completed. 47. On 3 September 1999 the District Court judge prepared a request for assistance which was to be submitted through the Slovakian Ministry of Justice to the competent authorities in the country of the applicants’ residence. In particular, the District Court sought that information be obtained from the first applicant and Mr O.A.M. as regards the care and education of the second applicant, Mr P.’s parental and visiting rights in respect of the second applicant and the second applicant’s adoption. The District Court also sought an inquiry into the general upbringing environment of the second applicant and the personal, social and material situation of the first applicant and Mr O.A.M. 48. In a letter of 26 November 1999 the Ministry of Justice invited the District Court to complete the request for assistance by submitting further information and copies of the relevant documents. 49. On 21 January 2000 the District Court took three separate decisions to discontinue the proceedings concerning, respectively, the education and care of the second applicant, the deprivation of Mr P. of his parental rights over her and her adoption by Mr O.A.M. The decisions stated that the second applicant had reached the age of majority in 1999 and that, therefore, the said matters could no longer be determined on the merits.","['13', '6']",['6-1'],[],['8'],[],[],1

BULGARIA,2,Violation of Art. 6-1;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - domestic and Convention proceedings,Peer Lorenzen,"5. The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Sofia. 6. On 15 September 1994 the applicant, who had several convictions and had served a number of prison terms, was charged with the theft of construction material from a warehouse. It was alleged that he had been one of the members of a group that had committed thefts. 7. The applicant did not appear when summoned for questioning and on 26 July 1995 he was arrested and remanded in custody, by order of an investigator or a prosecutor. He remained in detention throughout the investigation proceedings and the trial. 8. On 10 March 1997 the Sofia City Court acquitted the applicant. He was released on 17 March 1997. 9. Upon the prosecutor's appeal, the acquittal was upheld by the Supreme Court of Cassation on 11 December 1997. The Supreme Court of Cassation found, inter alia, that at the outset there had been clearly insufficient proof of the applicant's involvement in the thefts. In particular, a police officer had testified that the only reason for suspecting the applicant had been the presence of his name on an internal police list of nicknames as the person behind the nickname “Kolio Transki”. 10. On an unspecified date in 1998 the applicant brought an action against the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office, seeking damages in respect of his pre-trial detention. He relied on section 2 (1) and (2) of the State Responsibility for Damage Act (see paragraphs 22-25 below). 11. The applicant sought non-pecuniary damages for the suffering caused by his pre-trial detention, which had lasted one year, seven months and twenty-one days. In his initial claim he sought 11,000,000 “old” Bulgarian levs (“BGL”). In the course of the proceedings he increased the claim to BGL 47,000,000 (the equivalent of approximately EUR 23,600), including interest, which in his view was to be calculated as from 26 July 1995, the date of his arrest. 12. The Sofia City Court delivered its judgment on 9 February 1999. It held that the State was liable to pay all damage suffered by the applicant as a result of his “unlawful pre-trial detention” and the “unlawful bringing of charges” against him. 13. The court stated, inter alia: “[The Chief Prosecutor's Office] has not exercised the necessary supervision over the Sofia City prosecutors and the investigation authorities which, during a period of [more than two years], mounted an unjustified criminal prosecution against [the applicant] on charges of theft ...They remanded him in custody, imposing the harshest measure of judicial control, which resulted in [the applicant] spending nineteen months and fifteen [sic] days in detention...[The applicant] has undoubtedly suffered non-pecuniary damage... ” 14. As to the amount, the court considered that the length of the detention should be taken into consideration and rejected as unproven the applicant's contention that his health had deteriorated as a consequence of his detention. Deciding on an equitable basis, the court awarded to the applicant BGL 2,000,000 in non-pecuniary damages (the equivalent of approximately EUR 1,050) plus interest from the date on which the applicant had been acquitted with final effect, 11 December 1997. The court dismissed the remainder of the applicant's claim for damages. 15. The court further applied section 10 § 2 of the State Responsibility for Damage Act (see paragraphs 20 and 21 below) and ordered the applicant to pay BGL 1,800,000 (the equivalent of approximately EUR 940) in court fees. That amount represented 4% of the dismissed part of the applicant's claims. 16. The applicant appealed to the Sofia Appellate Court. He averred, inter alia, that the sum awarded in damages was too low and that it was unlawful to order him to pay court fees in an amount almost equal to the compensation award. 17. On 13 December 1999 the Sofia Appellate Court dismissed the appeal. As regards the court fees, it stated that section 10 § 2 of the State Responsibility for Damage Act was unambiguous and required the payment of court fees proportionately to the dismissed part of the claim. In the applicant's case, he had indicated an excessive amount in his claim and had thus himself brought about the situation complained of. 18. The applicant submitted a cassation appeal to the Supreme Court of Cassation which was dismissed by judgment of 16 August 2000. As regards the costs, the Supreme Court of Cassation reiterated the position taken by the Sofia Appellate Court. It stated that although no initial payment of court fees was required when bringing proceedings under the State Responsibility for Damage Act, in accordance with its section 10 § 2 the plaintiff was liable for fees in an amount proportionate to the dismissed part of the claim. By setting his claims at an excessive level, the applicant himself had caused his liability for a substantial amount in court fees. 19. In civil proceedings in Bulgaria, the general rule is that court fees are payable by the plaintiff in advance, upon the submission of the claim (Article 55 of the Code of Civil Procedure and sections 1-4 of the State Fees Act). A court fee at the flat rate of 4% is payable in respect of pecuniary claims (Fees Schedule 1 to the State Fees Act). Where the plaintiff succeeds fully or partly, the defendant is ordered to pay him his costs, including court fees, proportionately to the successful part of the claim. 20. By section 10 § 2 of the State Responsibility for Damage Act, in proceedings under the Act, no court fees or costs are payable by the plaintiff upon the submission of the claim. However, in circumstances where the claim is eventually wholly or partly dismissed, the court is to order the plaintiff to pay “the court fees and costs due”. The courts have interpreted the above provision as meaning that the plaintiff should pay court fees calculated as a pro rata percentage of the dismissed part of his claims. Article 63 § 1(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure provides for waiver of the fees in cases of indigence but concerns fees due upon the submission of the claim (argument from Supreme Court judgment no. 707 of 30.10.1995 in case no. 549/95). 21. As a result of section 10 § 2, where a court holds that a claim against the State is well-founded but excessive in quantum, it orders the State body concerned to pay damages to the plaintiff and at the same time orders the plaintiff to pay court fees to the State budget. Where the plaintiff indicated too high an amount in the claim form, the court fees may exceed the sum awarded in damages, the overall financial award being in favour of the State despite the finding that the plaintiff suffered damage which called for compensation under the Act (see, for example, the following judgments of the Supreme Court of Cassation: judgment no. 1095 of 25.07.2000 in case no. 139/2000 and judgment no. 805/05 of 1.08.2005 in case no. 56/2004). There is no provision for judicial discretion and considerations of equity play no role in fixing the court fees' amount. The court fees are fixed with reference to the amount indicated in the claim form, even if in the course of the proceedings the plaintiff makes a binding declaration waiving part of the claim (Interpretative Decision no. 3 of 22 April 2005, Supreme Court of Cassation). 22. Section 2 of the State Responsibility for Damage Act of 1988 provides, as relevant: “The State shall be liable for damage caused ... by the organs of ... the investigation, the prosecution, the courts ... for: unlawful pre-trial detention ..., if [the detention order] has been set aside for lack of lawful grounds... unlawful bringing of criminal charges, if the person concerned has been acquitted or the proceedings discontinued on the following grounds:...” 23. Persons seeking redress for damage occasioned by decisions of the investigating and prosecuting authorities or the courts in circumstances falling within the scope of the State Responsibility for Damage Act have no claim under general tort law as the Act is a lex specialis and excludes the application of the general regime (section 8(1) of the Act; реш. № 1370/1992 г. от 16 декември 1992 г., по г.д. № 1181/1992 г. на ВС ІV г.о.). 24. The following paragraphs – which draw on a summary report prepared by the research division of the Court's registry – describe relevant aspects of the system of court fees and costs in several member States representing different legal traditions, with emphasis on court fees in proceedings for damages against the State in cases where the respective domestic law provides for compensation for pre-trial detention. 25. The general rule with regard to compensation claims lodged with an administrative court (section 56 (11) of the State Fees Act) is that a state fee of 3 % of the amount claimed - but not less than 80 kroons (EUR 5) and no more than in civil court proceedings concerning an equivalent amount – is charged when the claim is brought. In case non-pecuniary damages are claimed but the amount of the compensation is left to the discretion of the court, a simple fee of 1,000 kroons (EUR 64) is due (section 56(12)). 26. The Unjust Deprivation of Liberty (Compensation) Act (Riigi poolt isikule alusetult vabaduse võtmisega tekitatud kahju hüvitamise seadus), which concerns, inter alia, criminal proceedings that ended in acquittal or were discontinued, provides that the individual concerned can lodge a compensation request with the Ministry of Finance. No fees are involved. The amount of compensation is fixed by the Act: it is 7/30 of the national monthly minimum salary (enacted by the Government) per day of detention. There is a presumption that this compensation covers non-pecuniary damage and loss of profit. 27. Compensation for pecuniary damage is regulated by the State Liability Act. In accordance with section 22 (1)(3) of the State Fees Act (which came into force on 1 January 2007), no fee is payable on a claim lodged with an administrative court for pecuniary damage caused by deprivation of liberty. 28. A claim for damages against the State can be brought under the Tort Liability Act. The court fee is approximately EUR 100-150, depending on the procedural actions undertaken by the court, regardless of the amount claimed. 29. Two avenues of redress are open in such cases: an administrative claim to the State Treasury in accordance with the Act on Compensation out of State Funds to Detainees or Convicts Found to Have Been Innocent (no. 422/1974 as amended) or a civil action for damages under the aforementioned Tort Liability Act. In either case no court fees are due in cases of detainees or acquitted persons. 30. Since 1993 the State has been responsible for paying court costs in respect of criminal proceedings. Article 149 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for a right to be compensated for all pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage sustained as a result of pre-trial detention in cases of acquittal or discontinuation of the proceedings. The claim is filed with the President of the Court of Appeal in whose area the criminal case was decided. All fees and costs in these proceedings are borne by the State. 31. Actions for damages for unlawful detention are adjudicated by the civil courts. Proceedings for damages against the State may also be instituted before the administrative tribunals, where the wrongful conduct was imputable to the public administration. 32. Court fees are in fixed amounts, irrespective of the sum claimed. The fees are different for first instance and appellate courts and modest in quantum: none of them exceeds EUR 30, according to the Decree no. 285 of 13 November 2002. 33. Actions for damages for unlawful detention are exempt from court fees (Article 15(g) of the Court Fees Act (no. 146/1997). In proceedings involving compensation claims against the State, the maximum fee is the equivalent of approximately EUR 10 (Article 3(m) of the Act). As to costs and expenses, at the conclusion of the proceedings, the losing party has to reimburse the other party's costs and expenses. 34. Claims for damages for unlawful detention are examined by ordinary courts in civil proceedings. Plaintiffs are exempt from court fees (Article 333.36, Sections 1(10) and 3 of the Tax Code) and the court cannot order the plaintiff to pay such fees at the end of the proceedings, even if the claim was partially or fully dismissed. 35. The successful party is entitled to the reimbursement of its costs. If an action succeeds only partly, the costs are divided proportionately between the parties (Article 98(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure). The defendant is required to pay into the federal budget a fee, from which the plaintiff is exempt, in proportion to the allowed part of the claim (Article 103(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure). 36. There are two possibilities for seeking damages for unlawful detention in Sweden. The first is an administrative quasi-judicial procedure before the Chancellor of Justice, who can award compensation in fixed amounts. There is no fee for the claimant. The second possibility is a civil action for damages before the civil courts, for which a modest fixed court fee is payable regardless of the amount of the claim. Also, the claimant who loses the case must pay the other party's costs 37. An action for damages against the state for unlawful detention is called a “claim for false imprisonment” which is treated as an action in trespass to the person (i.e. a personal injury claim) and is brought in the civil courts. Taking into account the money value of the claim and the complexity of the case, the court will allocate the case to one of three tracks: the “small claims” track, the “fast-track” or the “multi-track.” An action for false imprisonment is likely to be allocated to the multi-track. 38. There are several types of court fees that the claimant has to pay in proceedings for false imprisonment. The first one is the “issue fee”, charged for filing the claim. It depends on the amount of money claimed in accordance with a decreasing table. For example, the issue fee for claims of up to 300 British pounds (GBP) is GBP 30, for claims between GBP 5,000 and 15,000 it is GBP 250 and for claims between GBP 50,000 and 100,000 it is GBP 700. The higher issue fee, charged for claims of GBP 300,000 and higher, is GBP 1,700. 39. When a defence is filed, the court allocates the case to a track and orders the claimant pay an “allocation fee” in the amount of £100 (except for claims not exceeding GBP 1,500 for which no allocation fee is due). Finally, for matters that go to trial, a “trial fee” is payable as follows: in multi-track cases – GBP 500 and in fast-track cases – GBP 275, no fee being due for small claims track cases. 40. In respect of all fees, the court may decide that the claimant does not have to pay a court fee (exemption), or that he/she may pay a smaller fee (remission). That is usually done in cases involving indigent claimants. 41. When deciding on the award to be granted to the claimant, the courts enjoy a wide power to limit the amount that a party may recover with regard to the trial costs. According to the Civil Procedure Rules, the court is “to have regard to all the circumstances” in determining what costs are payable (r.44.5(1)). Those circumstances specifically include those set out in r.44.5(3), namely: (a) the procedural conduct of all the parties, including in particular, the efforts made, if any, before and during the proceedings in order to try to resolve the dispute; (b) the amount involved; (c) the importance of the matter to all the parties; (d) the particular complexity of the matter or the difficulty or novelty of the questions raised; (e) the skill, effort, specialised knowledge and responsibility involved and (f) the time spent on the case;. 42. There is a constitutional presumption that unreasonable charges would not be imposed in the court proceedings (Murphy v. the Minister for Justice and others, Supreme Court judgment of 9 March 2001, [2001] IESC 29).",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

ROMANIA,4,Violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading treatment;Inhuman treatment) (Substantive aspect),Alvina Gyulumyan;Corneliu Bîrsan;Egbert Myjer;Ineta Ziemele;Ján Šikuta;Josep Casadevall;Kristina Pardalos;Luis López Guerra,"6. The applicant was born in 1973 and is currently detained in Jilava Prison. 7. On 30 January 1996 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of murder. 8. On 3 November 1998 the Bucharest Regional Court sentenced the applicant to twenty years’ imprisonment for murder. 9. On 14 April 1999 Bucharest Appeal Court allowed an appeal by the prosecution and increased the applicant’s sentence to twenty-five years’ imprisonment. 10. On 28 October 1999, before the Supreme Court (now the Court of Cassation), the applicant orally withdrew his appeal, as can be seen from the court decision. According to that decision, the applicant was assisted by an officially assigned lawyer but not by an interpreter. The decision of 14 April 1999 became final. 11. The applicant was detained in the following prisons: from 9 May 1996 until 19 April 1998 he was detained in Jilava Prison; from 19 April to 30 April 1998 he was detained in the hospital of Jilava Prison; from 30 April to 12 May 1998 he was detained in Rahova Prison; from 12 May 1998 until 9 February 1999 he was detained in Jilava Prison; from 9 February 1999 until 21 February 2009 he was detained in Rahova Prison; from 21 February 2009 until 2011 he was detained in Giurgiu Prison; since 2011 he has been detained in Jilava Prison. 12. The parties disagreed as to the conditions of detention in Jilava and Rahova prisons. 13. The applicant alleges that while he was in Jilava Prison there were sixty people in one cell, and two or three people had to share each bed. He was moved on numerous occasions to different cells, which were all overcrowded. The water was contaminated and had worms in it, and the food was of very poor quality. This caused the applicant’s hospitalisation for ten days in April 1998 for enterocolitis. The heating was very low in winter and there was no ventilation in summer. Half the showers were not working and this, coupled with the overcrowding, made it very difficult to take a shower. 14. The applicant alleges that the cells in Rahova Prison were overcrowded. There were always twelve or thirteen detainees for every ten beds and occasionally people had to sleep on the floor. He alleges that to have a bed in the cell detainees had to pay, or else use force. 15. In a written statement signed by Mr T.X.L., a cellmate of the applicant ‘in 1996-97 in Jilava Prison, Mr T.X.L. wrote that the inmates were hungry and that he and the applicant had eaten snakes, cats and dogs. 16. A statement signed by B.S.A. alleged that the drinking water and the food at Jilava Prison contained worms and that there were cockroaches in the cells. 17. The Government argued that, in relation to the conditions of detention in Jilava Prison, it could not give any information concerning the dimensions of the cells, the number of beds and the available space. 18. The Government presented a written statement from the National Prison Authority (hereafter NPA) arguing that the food provided in Jilava Prison was fresh and respected the rules of hygiene and standards on calorie intake. 19. The Government acknowledged that the detained persons were regularly searched in order to remove prohibited items such as snakes, cats and dogs. The Government contended however that on no occasion did the applicant introduce such things into his cell. 20. The Government argued that drinking water was provided at all times, except on days when the system was being repaired, or during the summer when it was not functioning properly. On such occasions the water supply was stopped for a short period of time. The Government argued that reports have shown that the water was of good quality. 21. Detainees could shower each week in a room with nineteen to twenty-three showers. Every cell was allotted fifteen to thirty minutes for this. 22. Heating was provided on a preapproved schedule, with the exception of days when the heating system was being repaired. From 1999 there was heating from 1 November to 31 March. Because of malfunctions in the heating system the temperature of the water going through the water heater was 30ºC. 23. The Government contended that the applicant could participate in sport, cultural and entertainment activities and that he had the opportunity to work. 24. The Government stated, in connection with the conditions of detention in Rahova Prison, the applicant’s cell was 26.5 sq. m, of which the toilet had 1.78 sq. m; the bathroom’s area was 6.48 sq. m, the luggage storage area was 0.6 sq. m and the food space was 1.2 sq. m. The applicant’s room had a window measuring 1.44 sq. m and two windows of 0.72 sq. m each in the toilet and in the food area. Light was provided by light bulbs at night. Each room had ten beds, a table, chairs, a television table, a clothes hanging space, a luggage storage area and a food area. There were never more than ten people in one cell. 25. The Government argued that during his detention in Rahova Prison the applicant was diagnosed with hepatitis. As a result his diet was prescribed by the doctors and beef was substituted for pork. 26. A room next to the cell provided constant cold water and warm water according to a schedule. Warm water was available twice a week, for two hours each time, from 12 noon until 2 p.m. and from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. There was unlimited access to drinking water and to the toilet. 27. The cell was heated for eight hours a day, maintaining a temperature of 18ºC. 28. The Government argued that from 2007 the detainees had the opportunity to exercise for half an hour each day and to enjoy outdoor sport activities. The schedule for these activities was approved by the director of the prison. No evidence was provided as to the precise nature of the exercise or outdoor sport activities enjoyed by the applicant. 29. The Government submitted that the applicant took part in cultural activities. They provided documents from which it appeared that he was registered in 2007 and 2008 to attend computer classes, Romanian language classes and table tennis lessons for several months of the year. 30. The Government argued that no incidents concerning the applicant’s right to correspondence were identified after 2002. 31. Government Emergency Ordinance 56 of 27 June 2003 (“Ordinance no. 56/2003”) regarding certain rights of convicted persons states, in Article 3, that convicted persons have the right to bring legal proceedings before the court of first instance concerning the implementing measures taken by the prison authorities in connection with their rights. Ordinance no. 56/2003 has been repealed and replaced by Law no. 275 of 20 July 2006, which has restated the content of Article 3 mentioned above in Article 38, which provides that a judge shall have jurisdiction over complaints by convicted persons against the measures taken by the prison authorities (see also Petrea v. Romania, no. 4792/03, §§ 21-23, 29 April 2008). 32. The relevant findings and recommendation of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“the CPT”) are described in Bragadireanu v. Romania (no. 22088/04, §§ 73-76, 6 December 2007) and Artimenco v. Romania (no. 12535/04, §§ 22-23, 30 June 2009). In particular, the Court notes that in the report on the 2002-2003 visits the CPT expressed concerns about the limited living space available to prisoners and the insufficient space provided by the regulations in place at that date. It also noted that prisoners were sometimes obliged to share a bed and that the toilets were not sufficiently separated from the living space. 33. With regard to Jilava Prison, excerpts from the CPT’s findings following the visits of 1999 and 2006 are given in the case of Eugen Gabriel Radu v. Romania (no. 3036/04, §§ 14-17, 13 October 2009). In particular, the CPT expressed concern about the restricted living space, as the number of detainees was more than twice the prison’s capacity, the shortage of beds, the lack of adequate separation between the toilets and the living space in the cells, and described the conditions as “lacking privacy” and “an affront to human dignity”. 34. There is no CPT report concerning Rahova Prison. However, a Romanian NGO, APADOR-CH (Association for the Defence of Human Rights in Romania – the Helsinki Committee) visited this establishment on 13 February 2009. The report prepared following this visit indicated, based on the information submitted by the authorities, that the average personal space for prisoners was 2.77 sq. m. The overcrowding was obvious when visiting individual cells: one of the cells visited, measuring 18 sq. m accommodated eleven prisoners, even though it had only ten beds. As regards the prison’ food, the report indicated that only one detainee had complained about its quality and that many prisoners preferred to eat the food they received from home or that they bought from the shop. 35. Following visits in June 2006 to several prisons in Romania, the CPT published a report on 11 December 2008, in which it stated, inter alia: “70. (...) the Committee is gravely concerned that the lack of beds remains an ongoing problem not only in the establishments visited, but also at the national level, and has been since the first visit to Romania in 1995. It is high time that major steps are taken to put an end to this unacceptable situation. The CPT calls upon the Romanian authorities to take decisive priority action to ensure that that each inmate housed in a prison has a bed. However, the Committee welcomes the fact that shortly after the visit in June 2006, the official standard of living space per inmate in the cell was increased from 6 cubic metres (which amounted to an area of about 2 square metres per detainee) to 4 sq. m or 8 cubic metres. The CPT recommends that the Romanian authorities take the necessary steps to meet the standard of 4 sq. m of living space per inmate in shared cells in all prisons in Romania.”",['3'],[],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1959 and, at the time of the latest information from him, lived in Burgas. 6. In 1993 the applicant became the chairman of the board of a credit and savings cooperative (popular bank) – Popular BankPekov – having its registered office in Burgas. 7. In 1994 the applicant became the chairman of the board of the Union of the Popular Banks, having its registered office in Burgas. 8. On an unspecified date in mid-1995 criminal proceedings were opened against the applicant in relation with his duties as chairman of the board of Popular BankPekov. 9. On 15 August 1995 the investigation authorities requested the Nesebar District Court to attach certain assets belonging to the applicant and to Popular BankPekov, with a view to securing their forfeiture in the event the applicant was convicted. In a decision of 21 August 1995 the Nesebar District Court allowed that request. 10. On 25 August 1995 an investigator at the Burgas Regional Investigation Service attached further property belonging to Popular Bank-Pekov. 11. On 29 August 1995 the applicant was charged with having engaged in banking business without the requisite licence, contrary to Article 252 § 2 of the Criminal Code (“the CC”). 12. On 3 January 1996 new charges were preferred against the applicant. It was alleged that he had misappropriated 65,000,000 old Bulgarian levs (BGL) from the deposits made in Popular BankPekov, contrary to Article 203 § 1 of the CC. 13. It seems that witnesses were questioned on 4 January, 30 and 31 July, 17 and 23 September, 17 and 22 October, 4 November, and 6, 9, 10 and 15 December 1996, 14 and 18 January, 20 and 28 February, 20 March, and 4 and 7 August 1997. On an unspecified date an accounting expert report was drawn up. 14. On 4 February 1998 the applicant was charged anew under Articles 202 § 2, 219 § 1, 252 § 2 and 282 § 2 of the CC. 15. On 7 July 1998 the Burgas Regional Prosecutor’s Office decided to drop the charges under Articles 203 § 1 and 219 § 1 of the CC. On 15 December 1998 its decision was quashed by the Burgas Appellate Prosecutor’s Office insofar as it concerned the charges under Article 219 § 1 of the CC, and upheld, insofar as it concerned the charges under Article 203 § 1 of the CC. 16. On 10 July 2001 the applicant was charged anew under Articles 201, 202 §§ 1 and 2, 219 § 1, 252 §§ 1 and 2, and 282 § 2 of the CC. 17. On 18 December 2001 the charges against the applicant were amended once again to include counts under Articles 201, 202 §§ 1 and 2, 219 § 1, 252 §§ 1 and 2, and 282 § 2 of the CC. 18. On 3 July 2003 the applicant was charged anew under Articles 202 § 2, 219 § 4, 252 § 2 and 282 § 2 of the CC. 19. On 8 July 2003 the Burgas Regional Prosecutor’s Office submitted an indictment against the applicant to the Burgas Regional Court. 20. The first hearing, listed for 27 October 2003, was adjourned at the request of the applicant, who presented a doctor’s note to the effect that he was ill and could not attend, and argued that the copy of the indictment which had been sent to him had pages missing. Another reason for the adjournment was that most of the prosecution’s witnesses did not show up. 21. A hearing scheduled for 12 January 2004 was adjourned by reason of the failure of a number of witnesses to show up. The court ordered a new accounting expert report to be drawn up by three experts. 22. A hearing planned for 5 April 2004 could not take place because the accounting expert report had not yet been drawn up and a number of witnesses were absent. The court fined some of the missing witnesses and ordered that they be brought by force to the next hearing. 23. At the next hearing, which took place on 12, 13 and 14 July 2004, the applicant requested that the case be remitted for the correction of alleged procedural mistakes made during the preliminary investigation. His request was denied. The court heard the applicant and approximately fifteen witnesses. However, as a number of other witnesses were absent, the court adjourned the case. It gave leave to the parties to ask the experts additional questions. 24. A hearing took place on 15 November 2004. The court heard several witnesses, but as a number of others were absent, it adjourned the case. 25. A hearing listed for 7 February 2005 was adjourned at the request of the applicant, who presented a doctor’s note to the effect that he was ill and could not attend. 26. A hearing took place on 25 April 2005. The court heard several witnesses. The prosecution stated that certain amounts allegedly misappropriated and squandered by the applicant had been wrongly noted down in the indictment by reason of an error in the calculations. In reply the applicant submitted that the correction of the mistakes in the indictment constituted an amendment of the charges against him and requested an adjournment in order to prepare his defence. The court agreed and adjourned the case to 27 April 2005. 27. On 27 April 2005 the court heard one witness and adjourned the case at the request of the applicant, holding that in view of the large volume of written evidence, he should be given more time to prepare his defence after the amendment of the charges, even though this amendment consisted only in the correction of an error in the amounts noted down in the indictment. 28. At the time of the latest information from the parties (10 May 2005) the criminal proceedings against the applicant were still pending before the Burgas Regional Court; a hearing had been listed for 20 June 2005. 29. On 29 August 1995, when the applicant was first charged, the investigator dealing with his case ordered him to pay bail in the amount of BGL 500,000. The applicant appealed to the Burgas District Prosecutor’s Office, stating that this sum was too high and he could not pay it. In a decision of 11 September 1995 the Burgas District Prosecutor’s Office dismissed his appeal, reasoning that he owned sufficient assets and that the amount was justified in view of the gravity of the offence alleged against him. On the appeals of the applicant that decision was upheld by the Burgas Regional Prosecutor’s Office, but later, on 28 November 1995, varied by the Chief Prosecutor’s Office, which reduced the bail amount to BGL 250,000. 30. On 3 January 1996, when preferring new charges of misappropriation of funds against the applicant, the investigator of the Burgas Regional Investigation Service in charge of the case ordered his pretrial detention. She noted, without providing further detail, that the offence alleged against him was particularly serious, and that there was a risk that he could imperil the investigation. The investigator’s decision was confirmed by a prosecutor of the Burgas Regional Prosecutor’s Office the same day. 31. On the appeal of the applicant, on 5 January 1996 the Burgas Regional Prosecutor’s Office decided to release him on bail, citing his bad health requiring special medical treatment. It seems that the applicant paid the bail amount – BGL 250,000 – the same day and was released. 32. On 6 May 1996 the investigator in charge of the applicant’s case once again ordered his pretrial detention. She reasoned that he had failed to show up for questioning despite having been duly summoned on 26 March 1996. Moreover, on 2, 3 and 4 April 1996 it had proved impossible to find him at the address indicated by him in Sofia. The applicant had also failed to report to the Burgas Regional Investigation Service every second Thursday of the month, as ordered by the investigator. It could thus be inferred that he had failed to show up without good cause and that it was therefore necessary to take him into custody. That decision was confirmed by a prosecutor of the Burgas Regional Prosecutor’s Office on 16 May 1996. 33. In May and June 1996 the police conducted initially a local and afterwards a nationwide search for the applicant. 34. On 5 July 1996 the applicant was arrested. It was found that on 16 May 1996 he had changed his address without notifying the investigation authorities. 35. The applicant appealed against his pretrial detention to the Burgas Regional Prosecutor’s Office. In her observations in reply to the appeal the investigator in charge of his case stated that the his pre-trial detention was mandatory, as he had been charged with a “serious intentional offence” and there were no reasons to apply the exception provided for by paragraph of 2 of Article 152 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (“the CCP”). 36. On 6 August 1996 the Burgas Regional Prosecutor’s Office upheld the decision to keep the applicant in custody. It found that he had failed to notify the investigator in charge of his case of his change of address and to report to the Burgas Regional Investigation Service on several dates despite the instructions to that effect. On the other hand, the applicant’s state of health did not require his release. In consideration of this and of the fact that the applicant had been charged with an offence under Article 203 § 1 of the CC, i.e. a serious intentional offence, it was justified to maintain him in detention. 37. On the appeal of the applicant, the Chief Prosecutor’s Office upheld this decision on 13 September 1996. 38. During the following months the applicant underwent treatment in the prison hospital and was examined several times by medical doctors. 39. On 2 October 1996 the Burgas Regional Prosecutor’s Office decided to release the applicant from pretrial detention and place him under house arrest. It found that his remaining in custody could have an irreversible negative impact on his health. The attempts to treat him in the prison hospital had proved futile, whereas his state of health required immediate specialised hospital treatment. 40. On 10 October 1996 the applicant informed the investigator in charge of his case that he had to be admitted to a hospital in Sofia. He advised the investigator of his address in Sofia and obliged to report to the Burgas Regional Investigation Service every second and fourth Thursday of the month. 41. On 4 February 1998 and 10 July and 18 December 2001 the investigator in charge of the applicant’s case confirmed his house arrest of her own motion, without giving reasons. 42. During the period when the applicant was under house arrest, he changed his address several times for health reasons and because of difficulties in finding employment, each time notifying the investigator in charge of his case by mail. 43. The applicant was released from house arrest on 3 July 2003. 44. Article 201 of the CC makes it an offence for an official or a manager to misappropriate public or private funds which are in his or her possession in his or her professional capacity or which he or she has been entrusted with to keep secure or administer. By Article 202 § 2 (1) of the CC, as in force at the relevant time, if the misappropriated funds were in large amounts, between three and fifteen years’ imprisonment could be imposed. If the misappropriated funds were in particularly large amounts and the case was particularly aggravated, the punishment ranged between ten and thirty years’ imprisonment (Article 203 § 1 of the CC, as in force at the relevant time). 45. Article 219 § 1 of the CC makes it an offence for an official or a manager to fail to take due care in managing or keeping secure the assets entrusted to him or her, provided this failure results in substantial losses, destruction or dissipation of these assets, or other substantial damage to the undertaking or the economy. At the relevant time the punishment could be up to three years’ imprisonment. 46. Article 252 § 1 of the CC makes it an offence to engage in, inter alia, banking business without the requisite licence. By paragraph 2 of that Article, as in force at the relevant time, if the perpetrator had obtained substantial illegal gains therefrom, between one and six years’ imprisonment could be imposed. 47. Article 282 § 1 of the CC makes it an offence for an official or a manager to, inter alia, abuse his powers or rights in order to provide a financial benefit to himself or another, provided that this leads to nonnegligible harmful consequences. By paragraph 2 of that Article, as in force at the material time, if the harmful consequences were substantial, the punishment ranged between one and eight years’ imprisonment. 48. At the relevant time and until the reform of the CCP of 1 January 2000 an arrested person was brought before an investigator who decided whether or not he or she should be remanded in custody. The investigator’s decision was subject to approval by a prosecutor. The role of investigators and prosecutors under Bulgarian law has been described in paragraphs 2529 of the Court’s judgment in the case of Nikolova v. Bulgaria ([GC], no. 31195/96, ECHR 1999II). 49. The relevant provisions of the CCP and the relevant case-law of the Bulgarian Supreme Court have been summarized in paragraphs 38 and 39 of the Court’s judgment in the case of Shishkov v. Bulgaria (no. 38822/97, ECHR 2003I (extracts)). 50. A summary of the relevant domestic law may be found in paragraphs 5155 of the Court’s judgment in the case of Vachev v. Bulgaria (no. 42987/98, ECHR 2004VIII (extracts)). 51. The provisions governing judicial review of pretrial detention at the time when the applicant was held in such are summarised in paragraphs 7276 of the Court’s judgment in the case of Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria (judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII) and paragraphs 33-36 of the Court’s judgment in Nikolova (cited above). 52. Article 152a of the CCP, as enacted in August 1997 and in force until the end of 1999, read as follows: “1. The detainee shall be immediately provided with a possibility of filing an appeal with [the competent court] against the [imposition of detention]. [The appeal must be filed] not later than seven days after the [imposition of detention]. The court shall consider the appeal in an open hearing to which the [detainee] shall be summoned. The hearing shall take place not later than three days after the receipt of the appeal at the court. 2. The appeal shall be filed though the organ which has ordered the detention ... . 3. The court[‘s ruling shall not be] subject to appeal ...” 53. On 21 March 1997 the Assembly of the Criminal Divisions of the Supreme Court of Cassation decided to request the Constitutional Court to rule on the compatibility of Article 152 of the CCP, governing pretrial detention, with, inter alia, Article 5 of the Convention. It reasoned that by virtue of Article 5 § 4 of the Constitution the Convention was incorporated into Bulgarian law and that all statutory provisions should therefore be in compliance with it. It also stated that when deciding cases before them the Bulgarian courts should take into account the caselaw of the European Court of Human Rights (опред. № 1 от 21 март 1997 г. по н.д. № 1/ 1997 г. на ОСНК на ВКС).","['5', '6']","['5-3', '5-4', '6-1']",[],['5'],['5-4'],[],1

H.K., the applicant’s brother, had been a member of the Polish resistance troops of the underground National Armed Forces (Narodowe Siły Zbrojne), commonly referred to as the “NSZ”. The NSZ had been founded in September 1942 and, originally, formed partisan forces fighting the Germans during the Second World War. At the end of 1943 the NSZ’s command, considering that the defeat of the Germans was inevitable, decided that the main enemy was the communist Soviet Union and ordered that, from that time on, the NSZ should direct its attacks against the Red Army and the Polish communist partisan forces. After the liberation of Poland, some of the NSZ members took refuge in the West, while others, after being ordered not to attack the Red Army directly, established an underground resistance movement against the communist government. On 10 February 1948 H.K. was convicted by the Warsaw District Military Court (Wojskowy Sąd Rejonowy) in connection with, inter alia, his membership of the NSZ, which was considered an “illegal organisation established with the aim of subverting the political and legal system of the State”. He was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment and then served his sentence. He was released on an unspecified date. On 7 August 1956 he was shot dead by a militia officer. 10. On 3 September 1993 the applicant lodged an application under section 3(1) of the Law of 23 February 1991 on annulment of convictions whereby persons were persecuted for their activities aimed at achieving independence for Poland (Ustawa o uznaniu za nieważne orzeczeń wydanych wobec osób represjonowanych za działalność na rzecz niepodległego bytu Państwa Polskiego) (“the 1991 Act”) with the Warsaw Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki), seeking to have his late brother’s conviction of 10 February 1948 declared null and void. Shortly afterwards, the court decided that the applicant’s request would be examined together with a similar application, which had been lodged by the widow of a co-defendant of his brother on 24 June 1993. 11. On 27 December 1993 the applicant’s lawyer asked the court to set a date for a hearing as soon as possible, submitting that his client was an elderly person suffering from various ailments and that the court should therefore give priority to his case. 12. On 9 November 1994 the applicant’s lawyer again asked the Warsaw Regional Court to fix a date for a hearing, maintaining that his previous application for the proceedings to be accelerated had been to no avail and that the period of total inactivity on the part of that court had, in the meantime, exceeded one year. 13. On 21 November 1994 the Deputy Chief Judge of the Criminal Division of the Warsaw Regional Court informed the applicant that 10,000 similar applications had been lodged with that court during the previous three years. This had created inevitable organisational problems because the judges of the Criminal Division were doubly overburdened: by the number of criminal cases which they had to deal with as their normal work and by the extra work arising from the significant number of cases concerning applications for wrongful convictions to be declared null and void. Moreover, as far as possible, the court was giving priority to applications lodged by living victims of repression and, therefore, it had to postpone the examination of those lodged on behalf of deceased victims. However, and in any event, there was no possibility of clearing the existing backlog within the next few years. 14. On 7 April 1998 the Warsaw Regional Court listed a hearing in the applicant’s case for 25 May 1998. On that date the court annulled the conviction of 10 February 1948 insofar as it concerned the charges relating to activities regarded as having been aimed at achieving independence for Poland. Since no party to the proceedings appealed within the statutory time-limit of seven days, the first-instance decision became final on 2 June 1998. 15. The Law of 23 February 1991 on annulment of convictions whereby persons were persecuted for their activities aimed at achieving independence for Poland sets out rules concerning the conditions under which certain politically-motivated convictions rendered from 1 January 1944 to 31 December 1956 can be declared null and void, and provides for the State’s civil liability for such convictions. 16. At the material time the relevant part of section 1(1) of the 1991 Act provided: “Convictions or other decisions rendered by the Polish judicial, prosecuting or extra-judicial authorities during the period ... from 1 January 1944 to 31 December 1956 shall be declared null and void if the offence with or of which the person concerned was charged or convicted related to activities undertaken by him with the aim of achieving independence for Poland, or if the decision in question was taken on the ground that he had undertaken such activity. The same applies to persons convicted of resisting the collectivisation of farm land and compulsory contributions of foodstuffs.” 17. The relevant part of section 3, as applicable at the material time, read: “1. A conviction or decision [referred to in Section 1(1)] shall be declared null and void on an application lodged by [one of the following persons]: the Ombudsman, the Minister of Justice, a prosecutor, a victim of repression or any person authorised by law to lodge an appeal on his behalf; where a victim of repression has since died, or he has left the territory of Poland, or is mentally ill, such an application may be lodged by any of his close relatives: ... siblings or spouse, or by an association of persons persecuted for activities undertaken by them with the aim of achieving independence for Poland. 2. The court shall determine the case at a hearing on the basis of the case-file of the organ which made the original decision. It may, where necessary, obtain additional evidence. 3. A party entitled to file an application under paragraph 1 shall be entitled to appeal against a decision on whether or not the original decision should be declared null and void. 4. Unless otherwise provided, the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall apply by analogy to the proceedings [relating to applications under paragraph 1]; however, a prosecutor must participate in the hearing. A victim of repression [and other persons entitled under paragraph 1 to lodge an application] or, with the court’s leave, other persons may participate in the hearing. The hearing shall be recorded in minutes.” 18. On 21 May 1993 the 1991 Act was amended to the effect that its provisions from that date on became applicable to persons who had been persecuted or convicted for political reasons by the Stalinist Soviet authorities by virtue of an agreement concluded on 26 July 1944 between the Polish Committee of National Liberation (Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego) and the government of the USSR. Under that amendment, only the Warsaw Regional Court was competent to deal with applications lodged by this group of repressed or wrongly convicted persons. Later, on 3 February 1995, the 1991 Act was again amended; this time to the effect that all regional courts could deal with applications lodged by such persons. The second amendment took effect on 1 April 1995.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1
114,001-60157,ENG,CHE,CHAMBER,2002,CASE OF ZIEGLER v. SWITZERLAND,3,Violation of Art. 6-1;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses partial award - domestic proceedings,Georg Ress,"9. The applicants are Swiss citizens born in 1950 and 1957, respectively. The first applicant lives in Siebnen, the second in Lachen in Switzerland. 10. In 1994 the applicants announced their intention to construct a subterranean garage in Lachen. The neighbours complained, arguing that certain prescribed boundary distances between the real properties had not been observed. Their objection was dismissed by the March District Court (Bezirksgericht) on 19 July 1994. The court awarded the applicants, as defendants, 8,000 Swiss francs (CHF) for procedural expenses (Prozessentschädigung), as the plaintiffs, their neighbours, could themselves have verified that the distances in question had been respected. The court costs of CHF 1,149.20 were imposed on the plaintiffs. 11. The neighbours filed an appeal (Berufung) which the Cantonal Court (Kantonsgericht) of the Canton of Schwyz dismissed on 4 July 1995. In the operative part of its decision, the court took formal note of the applicants' commitment that no changes would be made within fifty centimetres from the border separating the real properties. The court also ordered the applicants to pay the plaintiffs CHF 4,000 as procedural expenses for the first-instance proceedings and CHF 4,000 for the appeal court proceedings, and imposed on the applicants the first-instance court costs as well as appeal court costs amounting to CHF 3,450.50. The court found that the applicants' plans had been incomplete and even incorrect and the terms employed had been vague, thus prompting the plaintiffs to uphold their objection. The uncertainty brought about by the applicants' conduct contrary to good faith had actually provoked the procedures before the two instances. 12. On 9 October 1995 the applicants filed a public law appeal (staatsrechtliche Beschwerde) with the Federal Court (Bundesgericht), complaining, first, about the imposition of costs, which in their view was disproportionate as the Cantonal Court had dismissed the plaintiffs' claims. There had been no obligation to submit plans, and neither the first nor the second instance had considered it necessary to ask for further plans. It was unclear to what extent the terms used had been imprecise, and indeed, the objections raised by the plaintiffs had a priori been completely unfounded. On the whole it appeared disproportionate that, for a matter of a value of CHF 10,000, the applicants were now asked to pay CHF 12,000 for completely unnecessary proceedings. Second, the applicants complained that the Cantonal Court had in its judgment incorrectly taken note of their commitment which in fact had not been requested by the parties in the proceedings. 13. The Federal Court transmitted the applicants' public law appeal for observations to both the Cantonal Court and the plaintiffs. 14. The Cantonal Court sent its reply, running to seven pages, together with the case-file, to the Federal Court on 16 November 1995, requesting the latter to dismiss the applicants' public law appeal. In its submissions it explained why the applicants' plans had been vague and that precise early information would have been necessary. The court continued that it was “quite typical for the (applicants') mentality” (geradezu typisch für die Mentalität) that they had submitted sketches of plans only after objections had been filed, since they knew that there were tensions with their neighbours and that the latter would object. Other remarks of the applicants were misplaced (deplaziert). The Cantonal Court furthermore submitted that it had been competent to formulate conditions in its judgment, in particular as to changes in the border area between the properties. 15. The plaintiffs filed their observations of five pages on 4 December 1995. Therein, they commented on the judgment of the Cantonal Court, and they requested the Federal Court to dismiss the applicants' public law appeal. 16. The Federal Court transmitted the various observations to the applicants' lawyer who, on 11 December 1995, replied: “In the above-mentioned case I thank you for serving the observations. I should like to ask you to let me have the case-file for consultation (which in the cantonal proceedings could not be fully undertaken, as the case-file presented by the Cantonal Court was incomplete). In its written 'reply' (of 7 pages), the lower court adds to its decision numerous new grounds as well as amendments to its reasoning. They are hardly objective and aim at twisting the facts in a manner not to be expected from a court. Pursuant to S. 4 § 1 of the Swiss Federal Constitution and Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, the applicants request the opportunity to comment on the 'reply'.” 17. By letter of 13 December 1995 the Federal Court replied: “You are objecting against inadmissible statements in the observations of the Cantonal Court and you request transmittal of the case-file. At the present stage of the proceedings, the parties can no longer exercise any rights. Therefore, and as we need the case-file for our decision, we cannot comply with your request for consultation. Inadmissible statements of the Cantonal Court will be disregarded ex officio.” 18. On 7 February 1996 the Federal Court dismissed the applicants' public law appeal, the decision being served on 9 April 1996. The judgment noted at the outset that both the Cantonal Court and the opposing party had requested dismissal of the applicants' public law appeal. In its judgment the Federal Court then declared inadmissible as being insufficiently substantiated the complaint that the Cantonal Court had incorrectly taken formal note of the applicants' commitment that they would not make changes within 50 centimetres from the border line separating the two properties. In respect of the complaints about the imposition of costs, the Federal Court noted that the applicants, by expressing the wish to construct the garage, had in fact unintentionally obliged their neighbours to institute proceedings and to defend their property rights, compliance with which had at the outset not sufficiently transpired from the plans. The Cantonal Court was entitled to combine the dismissal of the neighbours' objection with a clause that no changes could be made in the border area between the properties. On the whole, a person wishing to construct became responsible for provoking litigation if he did not from the beginning establish clearly that other persons' rights would not be affected. 19. Section 93 of the Federal Judiciary Act (Organisationsgesetz) envisages the following procedure after a public law appeal has been filed: “Exchange of Statements 1. If the court orders an exchange of statements, it transmits the appeal to both the authority from which the contested decision or act emanated and to the opposing party as well as any other persons involved. They are given an adequate time-limit to submit the case-file and to file their replies. 2. If the reasons for the decision transpire only from the authority's observations, the appellant may be granted a time-limit to complement his appeal statement. 3. Only exceptionally will there be a further exchange of statements.”",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1
115,001-80480,ENG,FIN,CHAMBER,2007,CASE OF A.H. v. FINLAND,4,Violation of Art. 6-1+6-3-d,Nicolas Bratza,"6. On 24 February 1997 T., a six-year old boy, described to S., a psychologist, that he had experienced improper touching while in day care and referred to the applicant in this connection. The interview was recorded on videotape in the Family Advice Centre. 7. The next day the alleged offence was reported to the police. On 13 March 1997, T. was interviewed again by S., on that occasion in the course of the pre-trial investigation which had been opened. That interview was also recorded on videotape. 8. The applicant was questioned on 26 and 27 March 1997. He was not aware of the existence of the above recordings. 9. On 7 April 1997 S. submitted a written opinion on the credibility of T.'s statements. 10. In his closing argument on an unspecified date the applicant contested the alleged improper touching. He noted that the videotape, which he had become aware of following the submission by S. of the above-mentioned written opinion, and the opinion itself, were indirect evidence, which in the light of the Convention had to be treated with extreme care. He questioned whether the questions put to the boy had not been leading in nature. He also submitted that the boy would have to be heard in court, should charges be brought. He did not request an additional investigation. 11. The applicant was charged with having indecently touched the boy when working at a day nursery which the boy attended. The alleged offence had taken place repeatedly over a period of several months beginning in the autumn of 1996. 12. The video recording was played back in the District Court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten) and the court heard evidence from the applicant, T.'s mother and S., the psychologist who had interviewed the boy. H., a doctor in psychology specialising in criminology and forensic psychology, who had not interviewed the boy herself, was also heard as a witness. Several other witnesses, including the applicant's colleagues and the parents of other children in day care, gave testimony. None of the witnesses made any observations on the alleged acts. The parents gave evidence only on the perceived changes in their children's personality. The psychologist testified only about the reliability of T.'s statements. 13. On 29 October 1997 the District Court convicted the applicant of sexual abuse and sentenced him to a suspended term of seven months' imprisonment. It reasoned: “... S. has interviewed T. and the interviews have been recorded on videotape. The videotape has been played back in the District Court where witnesses S. and H. have also seen it. S. and H. have been heard as witnesses and [the applicant] has had an opportunity to put questions to them. The fact that [the applicant] had no opportunity to put questions to T., for example during the pre-trial investigation, does not mean that the above-mentioned evidence could not be taken into account. At the time of the pre-trial investigation T. was six years old and he had his seventh birthday in August 1997. Thus, he could not be heard before the court. Even though [the applicant] has had no opportunity to put questions directly to T., the rights of the defence cannot be considered to have been jeopardised. In the light of the evidence submitted to it, the District Court has no doubt that [the applicant] is guilty [...]. ...” 14. The applicant, the prosecution and the complainant appealed, arguing that the lower court had based his conviction on T.'s testimony as given to his mother and also later recorded on videotape. He requested the appellate court to hold that this indirect evidence could not be used in evidence. He also repeated his view that leading questions may have been put to the boy. He stated that his right to examine witnesses had been violated as he had not had an opportunity to put questions to T. 15. On 26 June 1998 the Court of Appeal (hovioikeus, hovrätten), having held an oral hearing, upheld the conviction but increased the sentence to fourteen months' imprisonment with immediate effect. It found that the technical quality of the videotape, which had been played back in the court, was poor as regards its image and sound reproduction and that the contents of T.'s statements could not be reliably assessed merely on the basis of that recording. The recording however showed that S. had carried out the interview without any preconceived idea of its outcome. The statements of two of the applicant's colleagues showed that it would have been possible for the applicant to have acted as described in the indictment without anyone noticing. The statements of T.'s mother and other day care children's parents showed that there had been changes in their children's behaviour after they had been in contact with the applicant. The court did not mention the applicant's argument that he had not been able to put questions to T. 16. The applicant sought leave to appeal, arguing that he had not been afforded an opportunity to put questions to T. The indirect evidence should therefore have been rejected. 17. On 25 September 1998 the Supreme Court refused leave to appeal. 18. The Decree on Criminal Investigations and Coercive Measures (asetus esitutkinnasta ja pakkokeinoista, förordning om förundersökning och tvångsmedel; Act no. 575/1988) provides that when questioned during a pre-trial investigation the child must be treated with due respect having regard to his or her age and level of development. Where possible, the interview should be carried out by a police officer acquainted with that task. If need be, a doctor or an expert must be consulted before the interview (section 11). 19. The Criminal Investigations Act (esitutkintalaki, förundersökningslagen; Act no. 449/1987) provides that questioning and other investigation measures requested by a party must be carried out, if that party shows that there is a possibility that these measures could have an effect on the case, provided that the expenses so incurred are not disproportionate to the nature of the case (section 12). The competence to decide on investigation measures requested by a party lies with the head of investigation during the pre-trial investigation and with the public prosecutor after the case has been transferred to him or her (section 15(3)). A pre-trial investigation has to be carried out in such a manner that no one is placed under suspicion without due cause and no one is unnecessarily subjected to harm or inconvenience. Nor must the rights of those concerned be infringed more than is necessary for the achievement of the purpose of the investigation (section 8). 20. The investigator may permit a party and his counsel to be present during the questioning of another party or witness, provided this does not hinder the investigation of the offence (section 32(1)). A party and his or her counsel may, with the permission of the investigator, put questions to the person being questioned in order to clear up the case. The investigator may decide that the questions are to be put through him or her. Also, the prosecutor may put questions to the person being questioned. A party and his or her counsel have the right to request the investigator to ask the person being questioned about matters necessary for the clearing up of the case at other times also (section 34). 21. Before the closing of the criminal investigation, the parties must be afforded the opportunity to present to the criminal investigation authority their statement on the material gathered during the investigation, if this is conducive to hastening or facilitating the hearing of the case in court. The statement is to be appended to the investigation record (section 42). 22. The Code of Judicial Procedure (oikeudenkäymiskaari, rättegångsbalken) lays down the applicable rules on receiving testimony. 23. A witness must give testimony orally before the court and must not refer to a written testimony. Oral evidence given during a pre-trial investigation may be read out when the witness in question is heard by the court only if he or she retracts in court an earlier statement or states that he or she is unable or unwilling to testify before the court (chapter 17, Article 32; Act no. 571/1948). 24. If a person called as a witness is less than 15 years of age, is mentally ill or mentally retarded, or his or her mental capacities have otherwise been impaired, the court shall, taking into consideration the circumstances, assess whether or not he or she may be heard as a witness (Chapter 17, Article 21). Although the hearing of evidence from children falls within the court's discretion, there has been a long-standing practice not to hear evidence in court from children under the age of ten. 25. At the time of the proceedings in question, there were no legal provisions concerning the use as evidence of a video recording of a statement given by a child during the pre-trial investigation. There was however a practice to admit such recordings as evidence. 26. The Code of Judicial Procedure was amended with effect from 1 October 1997 to the following effect. A statement in a pre-trial investigation record or another document may as a rule not be admitted as evidence in court. The court may exceptionally admit as evidence such a statement, if the witness in question cannot be questioned before the court (chapter 17, Article 11; Act no. 690/1997). 27. The Code of Judicial Procedure was again amended with effect from 1 October 2003 to the effect that the testimony of a person under 15 years of age, or a mentally disturbed person, recorded on audio or videotape during a pre-trial investigation may be used as evidence if the accused has been provided with an opportunity to have questions put to the person giving the testimony (chapter 17, Article 11(2); Act no. 360/2003). According to the explanatory report to the relevant Government Bill (no. 190/2002), this new provision places emphasis on both the idea that giving testimony before the court may be detrimental to inter alia a child and on the importance of respecting the rights of the defence. 28. Chapter 17, Article 21 (as amended by Act no. 360/2003) of the Code of Judicial Procedure reads with effect from 1 October 2003 as follows: “(1) A person who has not attained the age of fifteen or whose mental capacities have been impaired, may be heard as a witness or for the purpose of obtaining evidence if the court finds it appropriate and: (i) if the hearing in person is of significant relevance for the establishment of the facts of the case; and (ii) the hearing is not likely to cause such suffering or other harm to the person to be heard as could be detrimental to the person concerned or his or her development. (2) Where necessary, the court shall designate a support person for the person to be heard, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 2 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Act no. 689/1997). (3) The person to be heard shall be questioned by the court, unless the court finds particular reason to entrust the questioning to the parties in accordance with the provisions of section 33. The parties shall be provided with an opportunity to put questions to the person to be heard through the intermediary of the court or, if the court finds it appropriate, directly to the person concerned. Where necessary, the hearing may take place on premises other than the court room.” 29. In 2003, the Criminal Investigations Act was supplemented with a new section 39a (Act no. 645/2003) that entered into force on 1 January 2004 and reads as follows: “The questioning of a victim or a witness must be recorded on videotape, or by using other comparable audio-visual means of recording, if there is an intention to use the statement given in the interview as evidence in court proceedings, and where it is not possible to hear the victim or the witness in person, due to his or her young age or mental disturbance, without causing likely harm to him or her. The special requirements set by the level of maturity of the questioned person for the methods used, for the number of participating persons, and for other conditions, must be taken into account in the questioning. The person in charge of the criminal investigation may decide that authorities other than the investigators may, under the supervision of the investigator, put the questions to the person being interviewed. The suspect must be provided with an opportunity to put questions to the questioned person. On the request of the suspect, he or she may also put the questions through a legal counsel or other representative. However, the investigator may order that the questions be put through his or her intermediary.”",['6'],"['6-1', '6-3']",['6-3-d'],[],[],[],1

The first applicant, Mr Aleksandrs Sorokins, and the second applicant, Mrs Marija Sorokina, are both Latvian nationals who were born in 1971 and 1939 respectively and live in Rīga. 6. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 7. On 20 June 1997 at 1.20 a.m. the State police in Rīga received a call from a private individual who informed them that thieves had broken into his neighbours’ flat. According to reports drawn up the same day by three police officers, a patrol team arrived at the address given ten minutes later. They saw a man (the first applicant) running away. They apprehended him and found various items on him, which, it was discovered later, belonged to the owner of the flat. According to a report drawn up the same day by police officer A.E., who had attended the arrest of the first applicant, when apprehended the latter bore no visible injuries. 8. Questioned on the same day, a neighbour, M.S., stated that she had seen the first applicant attempting to escape when the police arrived. 9. Following his arrest the first applicant was taken to Rīga Main police station (Rīgas Galvenā Policijas pārvalde). At 6.30 a.m. the applicant’s arrest record was drawn up. On the same day, from 11 a.m. to 11.35 a.m., the first applicant was interviewed and denied any wrongdoing. 10. He was repeatedly questioned the same day, from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m., and confessed to the crime, which he said he had committed with two acquaintances. He stated that he had been in the back yard of the building when one of his acquaintances had given him a bag containing the stolen items which the police later discovered on him. 11. On the same day (at an unknown time) the first applicant, who was represented by a lawyer, was brought before a judge of the Rīga City Centre District Court and remanded in custody. 12. On 25 June 1997 the first applicant was taken to the Central Prison. 13. On 27 June 1997 investigators questioned the two individuals identified by the applicant, as well as another suspect, J.V. The latter confessed to having committed the theft together with the first applicant. 14. On 30 June 1997 the prosecutor informed the first applicant at the Central Prison that he was being charged with large-scale theft. The applicant confirmed in writing that he had no objections or comments to make. Interviewed by the prosecutor on the same day, the first applicant denied his guilt and asked for the questioning to be postponed because he felt ill. 15. The first applicant was repeatedly questioned by the prosecutor on 7 July 1997, and confessed to committing the crime, which he said he had committed with J.V. According to the record of the interview, the applicant stated that his earlier statements were false as far as the two acquaintances were concerned (see paragraph 10 above) because “he had been subjected to duress at the police station”. On the same day J.V. refused to provide a statement. 16. On the same day the co-accused, J.V., alleged that his earlier statement had been given as a result of physical force used by the police. On 8 July 1997 he lodged a complaint in this respect, which was forwarded to the State police for examination. On 26 September 1997 the State police refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged ill-treatment of J.V. 17. On 20 August 1997 final charges were brought against the first applicant and the co-accused, J.V. The first applicant refused the assistance of a lawyer. On being questioned by the prosecutor, he maintained the statements he had given on 7 July 1997. 18. On 10 September 1997 the Rīga City Centre District Court decided to commit the applicant and his co-defendant for trial and to maintain their remand in custody. The first hearing was scheduled for 5 March 1998. 19. The first hearing was rescheduled for September 1998 because the judge was involved in other proceedings. The hearing was subsequently postponed until December 1998 because the co-defendant requested the assistance of defence counsel. The December hearing was rescheduled for February 1999 due to the absence of witnesses and the victim. 20. From 26 February to 1 March 1999 the Rīga City Centre District Court held a hearing. The first applicant asked the court to request a medical certificate attesting to his physical condition following the questioning during which he had confessed to the crime. The co-accused requested the court to call the doctor who had treated him after he was questioned at the police station. The court left both requests open pending termination of the court investigation, and remitted the criminal case to the Rīga Centre District Prosecutor’s Office for additional pre-trial investigation. 21. Following an appeal by the prosecutor, in June 1999 the Rīga Regional Court revoked the decision and referred the criminal case back to the lower court for adjudication on the merits. The first applicant submitted an ancillary complaint to the Supreme Court in which he stated, inter alia, that during the pre-trial investigation he had been subjected to physical ill-treatment. On 31 August 1999 the Senate decided to leave the complaint unexamined, on the ground that the impugned decision was not subject to an appeal. 22. In February 2000 the prosecutor asked the Rīga Centre District Court to transfer the criminal case to the Rīga Regional Court which, according to the prosecution, had jurisdiction in the case. The Rīga Regional Court refused the request, and in April 2000 the case was sent back to the district court. At the regional court’s request the Supreme Court ruled in June 2000 that the criminal case was to be tried by the Rīga Centre District Court. 23. The hearing scheduled for 14 November 2000 was postponed as witnesses and the victim failed to appear. 24. From August 2001 to March 2002 the hearing was postponed due to the co-defendant’s illness. 25. On 27 March 2002 the Rīga City Centre District Court, after obtaining the first applicant’s approval for the case to be examined in the absence of witnesses, began hearing the case. During the hearing the first applicant pleaded not guilty and alleged that he did not know J.V. and that he had provided incriminating statements only to avoid being physically ill-treated. 26. On 2 April 2002 the Rīga City Centre District Court found the first applicant guilty, and sentenced him to four years and nine months’ imprisonment. The first applicant had already served this term in pre-trial detention and was immediately released. His co-defendant was acquitted for lack of evidence. The court gave weight to the facts that the first applicant had never denied that he had the stolen items on him when he was arrested, and that this had been confirmed by witnesses’ statements. Preferring to give credence to the statements the applicant had made during the pre-trial investigation, the court noted that the case file disclosed no evidence to support the allegations that during his questioning the first applicant had been ill-treated by police officers. Moreover, the first applicant had not raised any complaints in this regard. 27. The court also relied on the fact that during the pre-trial investigation the first applicant had twice confessed to the prosecutor that he had committed the offence. It noted that the first applicant had never complained about the activities of the prosecutor. 28. In his appeal the first applicant pleaded that the statements made during the pre-trial investigation had been obtained as a result of his ill-treatment by police officers. 29. The appellate hearing scheduled for 6 August 2003 was postponed as the first applicant asked for witnesses to be summoned on his behalf. 30. On 18 December 2003 the lower court’s decision was upheld by the Rīga Regional Court. According to the transcript of the hearing, police officer A.E. stated that he did not remember either the first applicant or his arrest. On cross-examination by the first applicant, A.E. confirmed that force had been used to apprehend the first applicant. A defence witness, A.B., testified that she had seen police officers beating the first applicant on 20 June 1997. The prosecutor in response raised doubts as to whether the first applicant had been arrested in the circumstances alleged. 31. In the judgment the appellate court referred to the lower court’s reasoning and stated in particular: “... The case file bears no evidence that during the pre-trial investigation [the first applicant] had been ill-treated by police officers; moreover [the first applicant] had confessed [to the crime] being questioned twice by the prosecutor, and [the first applicant] had never complained about ill-treatment by members of the prosecutor’s office”. It further observed that the first applicant’s guilt had been attested to by a considerable amount of other evidence, such as witness statements and material evidence. It also noted that self-incriminating statements or denial of guilt could not serve as the only grounds to establish or refute guilt. The court further recognised that the first applicant’s pre-trial statements in relation to J.V. had been of a confusing nature and could not be used as proof of the guilt of his co-accused. 32. In his appeal on points of law the first applicant reiterated that his confession to the police officers had been obtained as a result of police ill-treatment. He also noted that he had not lodged an official complaint because of fear of retaliation by the police. On 12 March 2004 the Senate of the Supreme Court, in a preparatory session, dismissed his appeal without examining it on the merits. The Senate remarked that the internal investigation of the alleged ill-treatment did not find that the applicant had been beaten up by police officers. 33. It appears from the materials in the criminal file that on 12 November 1998 the first applicant asked the lower court to lift the detention order and stated that his confession to the offence had been obtained under duress. On 7 December 1998 the second applicant asked the lower court to release her son and stated, inter alia, in general terms that her son’s confession had been obtained by ill-treatment. On 9 October 2000 the first applicant asked the judge of the lower court to request information about his state of health when he was admitted to the Central Prison and testified before the prosecutor. 34. On 14 March 2001 the second applicant, in a representation to the President of the Republic, asked the authorities to investigate the ill-treatment to which the first applicant had been subjected on 20 June 1997. She stated that when she had first seen her son in prison he had been severely beaten and had lost a front tooth; his clothes were covered in blood. The lapse of time between the alleged ill-treatment and the complaint was explained by the first applicant’s fear that he would be the victim of reprisals while in prison. 35. At the request of the head of the State police inquiry department (Valsts policijas izziņas pārvalde) for information on whether the criminal file contained information revealing the unauthorised use of force against the first applicant, the judge of the lower court reported in May 2001 that no such information could be found in the criminal file. 36. The complaint was forwarded to the State Police which, on 25 June 2001, refused to institute criminal proceedings. The decision, drawn up by investigator Z.T., stated: [6.] Under questioning ... [the first applicant] explained that ... [a]t the arrest the police officers had knocked him to the ground, kicked him and hit him with truncheons, as a result of which he had lost consciousness. He regained consciousness only in the police car ... During the interrogation he had been subjected not only to physical ill-treatment but he also received threats and psychological intimidation. During the interrogation many police officers participated in beating and kicking him, for an extended period of time, on the body and head ... In addition, a plastic bag was put over his head, so that [the first applicant] could not breathe. In his statement [the first applicant] alleged that he had been ill-treated by many police officers, but that he could not remember or identify any of them. [7.] In addition, in his statement [the first applicant] alleged that he had repeatedly complained to the prosecutor’s office about police ill-treatment, which contradicts the information [received] from the Rīga Centre District Court [according to which] there is nothing to indicate ... that during the pre-trial investigation [the first applicant] had been subjected to ill-treatment by police officers or the prosecutor. [8.] When taken into the temporary detention unit of the Rīga Main police station no injuries were identified on the [first applicant], and he did not make any complaint, either about his health or about the behaviour of the police officers. [9.] [The first applicant] asked for medical assistance only on 26 June 1997 in the Central Prison: he was examined and bodily injuries were recorded; on this basis on 4 June [2001] a forensic medical examination was carried out. It appears from the report of [the forensic medical examination] that [the first applicant] had sustained the following bodily injuries: contusion on the right knee joint; contusion on the back with haematoma; bruises on both arms (the number, localisation and characteristics of the bruises not described), which were considered to be minor bodily injuries causing only short-term health problems of no more than six days. It was impossible to establish the exact time the injuries had been sustained, but it could not be excluded that the injuries could have been inflicted on 20 June 1997. [10.] [The police officer] A.S. stated that ... he had taken part in the arrest of [the first applicant]. He had not observed any visible bodily injuries on [the first applicant], and he could not remember the first applicant complaining of health problems or about the activities of the police officers. If the first applicant had raised any complaint about his health he would have been transferred to a medical establishment. [11.] Accordingly ... it can be concluded that during the preliminary review of the complaint no objective confirmation was obtained as to the allegations that on 20 June 1997 ... police officers had intentionally inflicted bodily injuries on [the first applicant], as [the latter] complained about health problems only on 26 June, whereas he was apprehended and questioned on 20 June”. 37. The Chancellery of the President and the Prosecutor General’s Office were informed of the decision taken, and a copy of the decision was sent to the second applicant. 38. Following the second applicant’s complaint of 26 January 2004, addressed to the President of the Republic, on 31 March 2004 a superior prosecutor of the Prosecutor General’s Office revoked the impugned decision and sent the case for additional investigation to the State police (Valsts policijas Galvenās Kriminālpolicijas pārvades Pirmstiesas izmeklēšanas pārvalde) on the ground that not all the facts and circumstances had been established when deciding whether to institute criminal proceedings in connection with allegations of ill-treatment. It appears that the prosecutor had issued specific instructions to the investigators. 39. On 8 May 2004, after obtaining statements from three other police officers who had taken part in the arrest of the first applicant, the investigator Z.T. established that the police officers had used force in accordance with section 13 of the Police Act, in that the first applicant had not complied with the officers’ requests and had attempted to escape. The decision stated: [the former police officer] AE stated that he had apprehended [the first applicant] and since the latter ... had attempted to flee, he had caught [the first applicant] and knocked him down, and that as a result they had both fallen down. As the first applicant did not resist, there was no need to apply other means of force. ... [A witness] A.B. testified that she had seen the first applicant being apprehended from her window, and that many police officers had spent a long time beating [the first applicant] with truncheons and kicking him ... ... [T]here are grounds to conclude that the assertions in A.B.’s statements contradict the report of bodily injuries in the forensic expert’s report [of 2001] ... and therefore there are grounds to call into question A.B.’s statement that there had been prolonged beating [of the first applicant] ... in that the bodily injuries of [the first applicant] did not correspond to the [above] description. ... [T]here are grounds to conclude that on 20 June 1997, when [the first applicant] was apprehended, the police officers acted in accordance with section 13 of the Law on Police, and the minor bodily injuries could have been inflicted while he was being apprehended, for, as noted by the police officers, [the first applicant] did not comply with their request, and attempted to escape.” 40. The decision was sent to the supervising prosecutor of the Prosecutor General’s Office and to the second applicant. 41. On 18 June 2004 the decision was upheld by a prosecutor attached to the Office of the Prosecutor General. The prosecutor stated that in the course of an additional inquiry no further evidence substantiating the allegations was identified. The decision also noted that, considering the time that had passed since the alleged events, it was practically impossible to obtain new information which could confirm or deny the applicants’ version of the events. The decision was subject to appeal to the Prosecutor General. 42. According to a medical report drawn up by the medical unit of the Central Prison, on 26 June 1997 the first applicant had complained of pain in the right knee joint and when urinating. He was diagnosed as having haematomas on his back (measuring 10 cm x 15 cm), on both arms (from 1 cm x 3 cm to 5 x 5 cm) and bruises on both arms (0.3 cm x 8 cm). According to the medical records of 3 July 1997 the applicant’s left knee was tender and painful and he was diagnosed as having a urinary infection and bruises on his body. The medical records also stated that according to the applicant “he had been beaten up when being arrested”. 43 Following the first applicant’s complaint of ill-treatment, on 14 June 2001 a forensic medical expert assessment was carried out, which concluded that the bodily injuries (an unspecified number and type of bruises on the left knee, arms and back) were minor and would not cause health problems for more than six days. The expert report could not determine the exact time the injuries had been inflicted on the first applicant, but it did not rule out the possibility that they had been inflicted on 20 June 1997. 44. According to the information provided by the Government, where a person showed signs of bodily injuries he had to undergo a medical examination before being admitted to a police temporary detention unit. However, the five-year period for the keeping of such documents had expired, and so that information as regards the first applicant was no longer available. 45. Under section 10, the basic duties of police officers include the conducting of investigations and necessary searches and other measures prescribed by the law in order to shed light on criminal offences and to identify their perpetrators. 46. Section 10 provides a list of situations in which police officers are allowed to use physical force, such as when arresting and conveying individuals to police stations, as well as when restraining arrested, detained and convicted persons if they do not comply or if they resist police officers, or if there is reason to believe that they may escape or harm others or themselves; 47. Section 27 states that a police officer shall be liable for any unlawful action in accordance with the procedure specified by law. If a police officer has violated an individual’s rights and lawful interests, the police authorities shall take measures to redress the violation and award compensation for damage caused. It also states that a police officer must not carry out or support any activity related to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment. No police officer may cite an order from a superior, or exceptional circumstances such as a state or threat of war, a threat to national security, internal political instability of the State or a state of emergency, to justify torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. According to paragraph six (the wording in force until 10 May 2005), the head of the police station reviews and decides on complaints about the actions of a police officer under his command. Such decisions are subject to appeal within one month to a higher-level institution. 48. Pursuant to sections 38 and 39, the functioning of the police shall be under the control of the Cabinet of Ministers, the Minister for the Interior and local municipalities, within the scope of their competence. The lawfulness of police operations is supervised by the Prosecutor General and subordinate prosecutors. 49. Section 3 provides, inter alia, that courts and public prosecutors are obliged to initiate criminal proceedings if indications have been discovered that an offence has been committed. 50. Section 41 provides that a public prosecutor performs supervisory functions, inter alia, by revoking unlawful and unreasoned decisions of the police, and other public prosecutors in subordinate positions, concerning criminal cases. 51. Pursuant to sections 19 and 51, only evidence obtained, proved and assessed in accordance with this code may be used in determination of a case, and courts must freely and objectively assess the evidence and reach their own conclusions which are based on a full, complete and objective assessment of all the materials of the case and in accordance with law and justice. No evidence has any predetermined weight which would bind the court. 52. Section 97 provides that defence counsel in a criminal case has the right to meet a suspect, an accused, or a defendant in private; to submit evidence; to lodge objections and submit requests; to participate in the questioning of a suspect and the charging and questioning of an accused, as well as in other investigative actions following a request raised by the suspect, accused or defence counsel; to participate in adjudication of a case; and to lodge complaints against decisions adopted by the entity in charge of an investigation, a prosecutor or a court. 53. By virtue of section 151 a prosecutor shall question the accused without delay following the bringing of charges. If immediate questioning is impossible, a record shall be drawn up explaining the reasons for the delay. 54. Section 220 sets out a procedure for lodging complaints against the activities of investigators, under which a suspect, accused persons and their representatives and defence counsel may submit a complaint to a prosecutor about the activities of investigators and others. Complaints shall be submitted directly to a prosecutor or to the person whose activities are the subject of the complaint. Complaints may be either written or oral. In the latter case the complaint shall be recorded by a prosecutor or an investigator and that record shall be signed by the complainant. An investigator shall forward the complaint, together with explanations, to a prosecutor within twenty-four hours. Pursuant to section 221, a prosecutor shall decide on a complaint within three days following the date of reception and shall notify the complainant of the outcome. If a complaint is rejected the prosecutor shall notify the complainant of the reasons. An investigator or the complainant may appeal against the prosecutor’s decision to a higher-level prosecutor. 55. Section 222 stated that complaints about a prosecutor’s activities are to be submitted to a prosecutor at a higher level, and are to be decided on in accordance with the procedures provided by sections 220 and 221. 56. Under section 449, a judgment can be examined by the cassation court only if it is vitiated by a material infringement either of criminal law or the law of criminal procedure. Section 451 states, inter alia, that breaches of the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which, inter alia, affected or could have affected the lawfulness, reasoning and fairness of a judgment, are serious infringements of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 57. In accordance with section 15, a prosecutor shall supervise the execution of custodial sentences and the institutions in which individuals are detained as a result. Furthermore, section 16 provides that a prosecutor shall, in accordance with the procedures prescribed by law, carry out an investigation if the information received concerns a crime or a violation of the rights and lawful interests of, inter alia, detainees. Paragraph 2 states that a prosecutor has the duty to take measures required for the protection of rights and lawful interests of persons and the State, if the examination of the facts regarding the violation of law is assigned by, inter alia, the President of the Republic. According to section 17, when examining an application in accordance with the law, a prosecutor has the right: to request and to receive regulatory enactments, documents and other information from administrative authorities ... to order heads and other officials of ... institutions and organisations to carry out examinations, audits and expert examinations and to submit opinions, as well as to provide the assistance of specialists in examinations carried out by the prosecutor; to summon a person and to receive from him/her explanations as to breaches of the law ... When taking a decision on a breach of law, the prosecutor, depending on the nature of the breach, has the duty ... to bring an action to the court, to initiate a criminal investigation or to initiate [proceedings on] administrative or disciplinary liability. By virtue of section 20, if it is necessary to bring an illegal activity to a halt, to rectify the consequences of such activity or to prevent a violation, a prosecutor shall submit a submission in writing to the relevant undertaking, authority, organisation, official, or person.","['3', '6']",['6-1'],[],['6'],['6-1'],[],1

The applicant was born in 1938 and lives in Benevento. 13. On an unspecified date E.A.S., a company, applied to the Benevento District Court for an order against the applicant for payment of 7,500,000 Italian lire (3,873.43 euros (EUR)) in performance of a contract for professional services. In a decision of 13 October 1988 the president of the court granted the application. The order was served on the applicant by E.A.S. on 28 November 1988. On 3 December 1988 the applicant challenged it in the same court. 14. Preparation of the case for trial began on 13 January 1989. On 18 January 1989 the case was joined to another case that was pending between the same parties. The immediate enforcement of the order was suspended. Of the seventeen hearings listed between 14 June 1989 and 26 November 1998 two were devoted to hearing evidence from the applicant, three to hearing other evidence, six were adjourned by the court of its own motion, one was adjourned to allow the parties to reach a friendly settlement, four were adjourned at the request of the applicant or both parties and one was adjourned because E.A.S. had failed to appear. 15. However, on an unspecified date the case was referred to the bench of judges dealing with the oldest cases (sezione stralcio). Of the six hearings listed between 16 March 1999 and 28 November 2001 one was adjourned because E.A.S. had not appeared (owing to the registry’s failure to notify it of the date to which the hearing had been adjourned by the court of its own motion), one because of a lawyers’ strike, one to allow the parties to make their submissions, and two by the court of its own motion. 16. Six hearings later, on 13 April 2005 the court set the case down for hearing of oral submissions on 8 June 2005. On that date judgment was reserved. According to information provided by the applicant on 12 October 2005, the proceedings were still pending. 17. On 10 January 2002 the applicant lodged an application with the Rome Court of Appeal under Law no. 89 of 24 March 2001, known as the “Pinto Act”, complaining of the length of the above-described proceedings. He asked the court to rule that there had been a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and to order the Italian State to pay compensation for the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage sustained. The applicant claimed EUR 14,460.94 in pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages. He sought the reimbursement of his legal costs, including those incurred before the Court, but did not quantify or give particulars of them. 18. In a decision of 21 June 2002, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 3 September 2002, the Court of Appeal found that the length of the proceedings had been excessive. It held as follows: “... Despite a number of adjournments for which the judicial authorities are not responsible because they were ordered at the request of the parties or because of a lawyers’ strike, the length of the proceedings was unreasonable. Whilst the allegation of pecuniary damage and personal injury is not supported by any proof, the applicant very likely suffered mental distress on account of the unjustified length of the proceedings. The resultant damage, given the foregoing considerations, can be assessed at 1,000 euros, and the legal costs, including those for the proceedings before the European Court of Human Rights, at 800 euros.” The Court of Appeal awarded the applicant EUR 1,000 on an equitable basis in compensation for non-pecuniary damage, and EUR 800 for costs and expenses, including those incurred before the Court, but without giving a breakdown. 19. In a letter of 21 January 2003 the applicant informed the Court of the outcome of the domestic proceedings and asked the Court to continue its examination of his application. 20. The applicant did not indicate that he had appealed to the Court of Cassation. 21. The Court of Appeal’s decision was served on 23 January 2003 and became final on 24 March 2003. The applicant served the authorities with notice to comply on 11 October 2003. The applicant lodged an application for a garnishee order with the Rome judge responsible for enforcement proceedings and a hearing was held on 28 March 2004. After obtaining a garnishee order on 27 May 2004, the amounts were paid on an unspecified date after service of the order. 22. Award of just satisfaction in the event of a breach of the requirement to dispose of proceedings within a reasonable time and amendment to Article 375 of the Code of Civil Procedure. CHAPTER II Just satisfaction Section 2 Entitlement to just satisfaction “1. Anyone sustaining pecuniary or non-pecuniary damage as a result of a violation of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ratified by Law no. 848 of 4 August 1955, on account of a failure to comply with the ‘reasonable-time’ requirement in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, shall be entitled to just satisfaction. 2. In determining whether there has been a violation, the court shall have regard to the complexity of the case and, in the light thereof, the conduct of the parties and of the judge deciding procedural issues, and also the conduct of any authority required to participate in or contribute to the resolution of the case. 3. The court shall assess the quantum of damage in accordance with Article 2056 of the Civil Code and shall apply the following rules: (a) only damage attributable to the period beyond the reasonable time referred to in subsection 1 may be taken into account; (b) in addition to the payment of a sum of money, reparation for non-pecuniary damage shall be made by giving suitable publicity to the finding of a violation.” Section 3 Procedure “1.

The court shall deliver a decision within four months after the application is lodged. An appeal shall lie to the Court of Cassation. The decision shall be enforceable immediately. 7. To the extent that resources permit, payment of compensation to those entitled shall commence on 1 January 2002.” Section 4 Time-limits and procedures for lodging applications “A claim for just satisfaction may be lodged while the proceedings in which the violation is alleged to have occurred are pending or within six months from the date when the decision ending the proceedings becomes final. Claims lodged after that date shall be time-barred.” Section 5 Communications “If the court decides to allow an application, its decision shall be communicated by the registry to the parties, to State Counsel at the Court of Audit to enable him to start an investigation into liability, and to the authorities responsible for deciding whether to institute disciplinary proceedings against the civil servants involved in the proceedings in any capacity.” Section 6 Transitional provisions “1. Within six months after the entry into force of this Act, anyone who has lodged an application with the European Court of Human Rights in due time complaining of a violation of the ‘reasonable-time’ requirement contained in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ratified by Law no. 848 of 4 August 1955, shall be entitled to lodge a claim under section 3 hereof provided that the application has not by then been declared admissible by the European Court. In such cases, the application to the court of appeal must state when the application to the said European Court was made. 2. The registry of the relevant court shall inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs without delay of any claim lodged in accordance with section 3 and within the period laid down in subsection 1 of this section.” Section 7 Financial provisions “1. The financial cost of implementing this Act, which is put at 12,705,000,000 Italian lire from 2002, shall be met by releasing funds entered in the three-year budget 2001-03 in the chapter concerning the basic current-liability estimates from the ‘special fund’ in the year 2001 forecast of the Ministry of the Treasury, Economy and Financial Planning. Treasury deposits shall be set aside for that purpose. 2. The Ministry of the Treasury, Economy and Financial Planning is authorised to make the appropriate budgetary adjustments by decree.” 23. On appeal from decisions delivered by the courts of appeal in “Pinto” proceedings, the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court (Sezioni Unite), gave four judgments (nos. 1338, 1339, 1340 and 1341) on 27 November 2003, the texts of which were deposited with the registry on 26 January 2004, quashing the appeal court’s decision and remitting the case for a rehearing. It held that “the case-law of the Strasbourg Court is binding on the Italian courts regarding the application of Law no. 89/2001”. In its judgment no. 1340 it affirmed, inter alia, the principle that “the court of appeal’s determination of non-pecuniary damage in accordance with section 2 of Law no. 89/2001, although inherently based on equitable principles, must be done in a legally defined framework since reference has to be made to the amounts awarded, in similar cases, by the Strasbourg Court. Some divergence is permissible, within reason.” 24. Extracts from the plenary Court of Cassation’s judgment no. 1339 deposited with the registry on 26 January 2004 “... 2.- The present application poses the fundamental question of what legal effect must be given – in implementing the Law of 24 March 2001 no. 89, and in particular in determining the non-pecuniary damage arising out of the breach of the reasonable length of proceedings requirement – to the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, whether considered generally as interpretative guidelines which the said Court has laid down with regard to the consequences of the said violation, or with reference to a specific case in which the European Court has already had occasion to give a judgment on the delay in reaching a decision. ... As stipulated in section 2.1 of the said Law, the legal fact which gives rise to the right to the just satisfaction that it provides for is constituted by the “violation of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ratified in accordance with the Law of 4 August 1955 no. 848, for failure to comply with the reasonable time referred to in Article 6, paragraph 1 of the Convention.” In other words, Law no. 89/2001 identifies the fact constituting the right to compensation by reference to a specific provision of the European Convention on Human Rights. This Convention instituted a Court (the European Court of Human Rights, with its seat in Strasbourg) to ensure compliance with the provisions contained therein (Article 19). Accordingly, the competence of the said court to determine, and therefore to interpret, the significance of the said provisions must be recognised. As the fact constituting the right conferred by Law no. 89/2001 consists of a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights, it is for the Court of the European Convention on Human Rights to determine all the elements of such a legal fact, which thus ends by being “brought into conformity” by the Strasbourg Court, whose case-law is binding on the Italian courts in so far as the application of Law no. 89/2001 is concerned. It is not necessary therefore to pose the general problem of the relationships between the European Convention on Human Rights and the internal judicial system, which the Advocate-General (Procuratore Generale) has amply discussed in court. Whatever opinion one may have about that controversial issue and therefore about the place of the European Convention on Human Rights in the context of the sources of domestic law, it is certain that the direct implementation in the Italian judicial system of a provision of the European Convention on Human Rights, established by Law no. 89/2001 (that is, by Article 6 § 1 in the part relating to “reasonable time”), cannot diverge from the interpretation which the European Court gives of the same provision. The opposite argument, which would permit a substantial divergence between the application accorded to Law no. 89/2001 in the national system and the interpretation given by the Strasbourg Court to the right to reasonable length of proceedings, would deprive the said Law no. 89/2001 of any justification and cause the Italian State to violate Article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights, according to which ‘The High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of this Convention’ (including the said Article 6, which provides for the right to have a case decided within a reasonable length of time). The reason behind the enactment of Law no. 89/2001 was the need to provide a domestic judicial remedy against violations in respect of the duration of proceedings, so as to give effect to the subsidiary character of intervention on the part of the Court of Strasbourg, expressly provided for by the European Convention on Human Rights (Article 35: “the Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted”). The European system for the protection of human rights is founded on the said principle of subsidiarity. From it derives the duty of the States which have ratified the European Convention on Human Rights to guarantee to individuals the protection of the rights recognised by the European Convention on Human Rights, above all in their own internal order and vis-à-vis the organs of the national judicial system. And this protection must be “effective” (Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights), that is, of a kind to remedy the claim without the need for recourse to the Strasbourg Court. The domestic remedy introduced by Law no. 89/2001 did not previously exist in the Italian system, with the consequence that appeals against Italy in respect of a violation of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights had “clogged” (the term used by rapporteur Follieri in the sitting of the Senate of 28 September 2000) the European Court. The Strasbourg Court observed, prior to Law no. 89/2001, that the said failures to comply on the part of Italy “reflect a continuing situation that has not yet been remedied and in respect of which litigants have no domestic remedy. This accumulation of breaches accordingly constitutes a practice that is incompatible with the Convention” (see the four judgments of the Court delivered on 28 July 1999 in the cases of Bottazzi, Di Mauro, Ferrari and A. P.). Law no. 89/2001 constitutes the domestic remedy to which a “victim of a violation” (as defined by Article 34 of the European Convention on Human Rights) of Article 6 (failure to comply with the reasonable-time requirement) must have recourse before applying to the European Court to claim the “just satisfaction” provided for in Article 41 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which, when the violation exists, is only awarded by the Court “if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made”. Law no. 89/2001 has therefore allowed the European Court to declare inadmissible applications lodged with it (including before the Act was passed) and aimed at obtaining just satisfaction provided for in Article 41 of the European Convention on Human Rights for the excessive length of proceedings (Brusco v. Italy, decision of 6 September 2001). This mechanism for implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights and observance of the principle of subsidiarity in respect of interventions of the European Court of Strasbourg does not operate, however, in cases in which the Court holds that the consequences of the established violation of the European Convention on Human Rights have not been redressed by domestic law or that this has been done only “partially”, because in such an event the said Article 41 provides for the intervention of the European Court to protect the “victim of the violation”. In such cases an individual application to the Strasbourg Court on the basis of Article 34 of the European Convention on Human Rights is admissible (Scordino and Others v. Italy, decision of 27 March 2003) and the Court acts directly to protect the rights of the victim whom it considers not to have been adequately protected by domestic law. The judge of the adequacy or inadequacy of the protection that the victim has had from domestic law is, obviously, the European Court, whose duty it is to apply Article 41 of the European Convention on Human Rights to ascertain whether, in the presence of a violation of a provision of the European Convention on Human Rights, the internal law has been able to fully redress the consequences of this violation. The argument whereby, in applying Law no. 89/2001, the Italian court may follow a different interpretation from that which the European Court has given to the provisions of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (violation of which is the fact giving entitlement to the right to compensation attributed by the said national law) implies that the victim of the violation, if he or she receives reparation at national level considered inadequate by the European Court, must obtain the just satisfaction provided for in Article 41 of the European Convention on Human Rights from the latter Court. This would defeat the purpose of the remedy provided for in Italian law by Law no. 89/2001 and entail a violation of the principle of the subsidiarity of the intervention of the Strasbourg Court. It is therefore necessary to concur with the European Court of Human Rights, which, in the above-mentioned decision on the Scordino application (concerning the inadequacy of the protection afforded by the Italian courts in implementing Law no. 89/2001), affirmed that “it follows from the principle of subsidiarity ... that the national courts must, where possible, interpret and apply domestic law in accordance with the Convention”. ... The preparatory documents of Law no. 89/2001 are even more explicit. In the report concerning the bill of Senator Pinto (proceedings of the Senate no. 3813 of 16 February 1999) it is affirmed that the compensatory mechanism proposed in the legislative initiative (and then adopted by the Act) secures for the applicant “a protection analogous to that which he or she would receive in the international court”, as the direct reference to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights makes it possible to transfer to domestic level “the limits of applicability of the same provision existing at international level, limits which depend essentially on the State and on the development of the case-law of the Strasbourg authorities, especially that of the European Court of Human Rights, whose decisions must therefore guide ... the domestic court in the definition of these limits”. ... 6. – The considerations expounded in sections 3-5 of the document refer in general to the importance of the interpretative guidance of the European Court on the implementation of Law no. 89/2001 with regard to reparation for non-pecuniary damage. In this particular instance, however, any possibility for the national court to exclude non-pecuniary damage (despite having found a violation of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights) must be considered as non-existent because such is precluded by the previous decision of the European Court which, with reference to the same proceedings, had already ascertained that the unjustified delay in reaching a decision had had consequences involving non-pecuniary damage for the applicant, which the Court itself redressed for a limited period. From such a decision of the European Court it follows that, once the national court has ascertained that the violation has continued in the period following that considered in the said decision, the applicant has continued to suffer non-pecuniary damage, which must be compensated for in application of Law no. 89/2001. It cannot therefore be maintained – as the Rome Court of Appeal has done – that compensation is not due because of the small amounts at stake in the proceedings in question. Such a reason, apart from being rendered immaterial by the fact that the European Court has already ruled that non-pecuniary damage had been sustained because of delay in the same action, is in any case incorrect, because the amount of what is at stake in an action in which non-compliance with reasonable time-limits has been ascertained can never have the effect of excluding non-pecuniary damage, given that the anxiety and distress resulting from the length of the proceedings normally also occur in cases in which the amounts at stake are small; hence this aspect may have the effect of reducing the amount of compensation but not of totally excluding it. 7 – In conclusion the decision appealed against must be quashed and the case remitted to the Rome Court of Appeal, which, in a different composition, will order payment to the applicant of the non-pecuniary damages payable as a result of the violation of the reasonable-time requirement for the period following 16 April 1996 alone, taking as a reference point payments of the same kind of damages by the European Court of Human Rights, from which it may diverge, but only to a reasonable extent (HR Court, 27 March 2003, Scordino v. Italy)”. 25. The Court of Cassation held as follows: “...Where the victim of unreasonably lengthy proceedings dies prior to the entry into force of Law no. 89 of 2001 [known as the “Pinto Act”] this shall preclude a right [to just satisfaction] from arising and passing to the heirs, in accordance with the general rule that a person who has died cannot become entitled to a right conferred by an Act that is passed after their death...” 26. The Court of Cassation judges noted that the right to compensation for a violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time derived from the Pinto Act. The mechanism set in place by the European standard did not give applicants a cause of action before the domestic courts. Accordingly, the right to “just satisfaction” could neither be acquired nor transferred by a person who had already died by the time the Pinto Act came into force. The fact that the deceased had, while alive, lodged an application with the Strasbourg Court was not decisive. Section 6 of the Pinto Act did not constitute, as the applicants had maintained, a procedural standard bringing about a transfer of powers from the European Court to the domestic courts. 27. In this case, which concerned the possibility or otherwise of transferring to heirs the right to compensation deriving from a breach of Article 6 § 1 on account of the length of the proceedings, the First Division of the Court of Cassation referred the case to the full court indicating that there was a conflict between the case-law authorities, that is, between the restrictive approach taken by the Court of Cassation in the earlier judgments regarding heirs and the Pinto Act and the four judgments delivered by the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, on 26 January 2004 to the extent that a less strict interpretation would lead to the conclusion that this right to compensation has existed since Italy ratified the European Convention on 4 August 1955. 28. In the case giving rise to the order mentioned above referring the case to the full court (see preceding paragraph), the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, established the following principles, thus preventing any further conflicting decisions being given by the courts: (i) Law no. 848 of 4 August 1955, which ratified the Convention and made it enforceable, introduced into domestic legal order the fundamental rights, belonging to the category of rights conferred on the individual by public law, provided for in the first section of the Convention and which correspond to a large extent with those set forth in Article 2 of the Constitution. In that respect the Convention provisions are confirmatory and illustrative. ... (ii) It is necessary to reiterate the principle that the act giving rise to the right to reparation conferred by domestic law corresponds to a breach of the provision in Article 6 of the Convention, which is immediately applicable in domestic law. The distinction between the right to a hearing within a reasonable time, introduced by the European Convention on Human Rights (or even pre-existing as a constitutionally protected value), and the right to equitable reparation, which was allegedly introduced only by the Pinto Act, cannot be allowed in so far as the protection provided by the domestic courts does not depart from that previously offered by the Strasbourg Court, the domestic courts being bound to comply with the case-law of the European Court. ... (iii) Accordingly, the right to equitable reparation for loss sustained as a result of the unreasonable length of proceedings prior to the entry into force of Law no. 89/2001 must be acknowledged by the domestic courts even in favour of the heirs of a party who introduced the proceedings before that date, subject only to the condition that the claim has not already been lodged with the Strasbourg Court and the Court has not ruled on admissibility. ... 29. This judgment of the Court of Cassation concerned an appeal by the Ministry of Justice challenging the Court of Appeal’s award of non-pecuniary damages to a juristic person. The Court of Cassation referred to the decision reached in the case of Comingersoll v. Portugal [GC], no. 35382/97, ECHR 2000IV and, after referring to the four judgments of the full court delivered on 26 January 2004, found that its own case-law was not in line with the European Court. It held that there was no legal barrier to awarding just satisfaction to “juristic” persons according to the criteria of the Strasbourg Court. Accordingly, since the Court of Appeal had correctly decided the case the appeal was dismissed. 30. The Court of Cassation made the following observations: “ ... [Whereas] non-pecuniary damage is the normal, albeit not automatic, consequence of a breach of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time, it will be deemed to exist, without it being necessary to specifically prove it (directly or by presumption), on the basis of the objective fact of the breach, on condition that there are no special circumstances indicating the absence of any such damage in the actual case concerned (Cass. A.P. 26 January 2004 nos. 1338 and 1339). - the assessment on an equitable basis of compensation for non-pecuniary damage is subject – on account of the specific reference in section 2 of Law no. 89 of 24 March 2001 to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ratified by Law no. 848 of 4 August 1955) – to compliance with the Convention, in accordance with the judicial interpretation given by the Strasbourg Court (non-compliance with which results in a violation of the law), and must therefore, as far as possible, be commensurate, in substantive and not merely formal terms, with the amounts paid in similar cases by the European Court, it being possible to adduce exceptional circumstances that suggest themselves in the particular case, on condition that they are reasoned, not excessive and not unreasonable (Cass. A.P. 26 January 2004 no. 1340). ... - a discrepancy in the method of calculation [between the Court’s case-law and section 2 of the Pinto Act] shall not affect the general vocation of Law no. 89 of 2001 to meet the objective of awarding proper compensation for a breach of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time (vocation acknowledged by the European Court in, inter alia, a decision of 27 March 2003 in Scordino v. Italy (application no. 36813/97)), and accordingly shall not allow any doubt as to the compatibility of that domestic standard with the international commitments entered into by the Italian Republic when ratifying the European Convention and the formal recognition, also at constitutional level, of the principle stated in Article 6 § 1 of that Convention...” 31. In the report CM/Inf/DH(2004)23, revised on 24 September 2004, the Ministers’ deputies made the following indications regarding an assessment of the Pinto remedy: “...11. As regards the domestic remedy introduced in 2001 by the “Pinto Act”, a number of shortcomings remain, particularly in connection with the effectiveness of the remedy and its application in conformity with the Convention: in particular, the law does not provide yet for the acceleration of pending proceedings. ... 109. In the framework of its examination of the 1st annual report, the Committee of Ministers expressed concern at the fact that this legislation did not foresee the speeding up of the proceedings and that its application posed a risk of aggravating the backlog of the appeal courts. ... 112. It should be pointed out that in the framework of its examination of the 2nd annual report, the Committee of Ministers had noted with concern that the Convention had no direct effect and had consequently invited the Italian authorities to intensify their efforts at national level as well as their contacts with the different bodies of the Council of Europe competent in this field. ...” 32. In this interim resolution the Ministers’ deputies indicated as follows: “The Committee of Ministers Noting ... “...the setting-up of a domestic remedy providing compensation in cases of excessive length of proceedings, adopted in 2001 (the ""Pinto” law), as well as the recent development of the case-law of the Court of cassation, increasing the direct effect of the case-law of the European Court in the Italian legal system, while noting that this remedy still does not enable for acceleration of proceedings so as to grant effective redress to all victims; Stressing that the setting-up of domestic remedies does not dispense states from their general obligation to solve the structural problems underlying violations; Finding that despite the efforts undertaken, numerous elements still indicate that the solution to the problem will not be found in the near future (as evidenced in particular by the statistical data, the new cases before both domestic courts and the European Court, the information contained in the annual reports submitted by the government to the Committee and in the reports of the Prosecutor General at the Court of cassation); ... Stressing the importance the Convention attaches to the right to fair administration of justice in a democratic society and recalling that the problem of the excessive length of judicial proceedings, by reason of its persistence and extent, constitutes a real danger for the respect of the rule of law in Italy; ... URGES the Italian authorities to enhance their political commitment and make it their effective priority to meet Italy’s obligation under the Convention and the Court’s judgments, to secure the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time to all persons under Italy’s jurisdiction. ...” 33. The European Commission for the efficiency of justice was set up at the Council of Europe by Resolution Res(2002)12 with the aim of (a) improving the efficiency and the functioning of the justice of member States with a view to ensuring that everyone within their jurisdiction can enforce their legal rights effectively, thereby generating increased confidence of the citizens in the justice system and (b) enabling a better implementation of the international legal instruments of the Council of Europe concerning efficiency and fairness of justice. 34. In its framework programme (CEPEJ (2004) 19 Rev 2 § (7) the CEPEJ noted that “the mechanisms which are limited to compensation are too weak and do not adequately incite the States to modify their operational process, and provide compensation only a posteriori in the event of a proven violation instead of trying to find a solution for the problem of delays.”",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1969 and lives in Nizhniy Novgorod. He is the head of the Nizhniy Novgorod Human Rights Union. 6. It transpires from a certificate issued by an official of the Volgo-Vyatskiy Interior Department of Transport on 17 April 2008 that on 23 March 2007 the applicant’s name was registered in a so-called “Surveillance Database” (“Сторожевой контроль”). An extract from the list of persons registered in that database shows that the applicant’s name is mentioned in the section entitled “Human Rights Activists”. 7. The Surveillance Database contains information about skinheads, human rights activists and other persons allegedly involved in extremist activities. Whenever a person mentioned in the database purchases a train or aeroplane ticket the Interior Department of Transport receives an automatic notification. 8. An EU-Russia Summit was scheduled for 17 and 18 May 2007 in Samara. 9. On 10 May 2007 the Volgo-Vyatskiy Interior Department of Transport sent a telex to its local branches informing them that protest rallies by several opposition organisations were planned for 18 May 2007. To prevent unlawful and extremist acts it was necessary, in accordance with the Suppression of Extremism Act and Order no. 47, On certain measures intended to strengthen the fight against extremism, issued by the Interior Ministry on 14 April 2005, to detect and stop all members of those organisations travelling to Samara between 8 and 20 May 2007. In particular, it was necessary to separate the travellers and dissuade them from going to Samara. 10. On an unspecified date the applicant bought a train ticket to Samara for 13 May 2007 and a return ticket for 16 May 2007. 11. On 13 May 2007 the Volgo-Vyatskiy Interior Department of Transport sent a telex to its local branches informing them that the applicant intended to travel to Samara in connection with the EU-Russia Summit. It also communicated his train reservation details. Another telex sent on the same day by the Samara Interior Department of Transport indicated that the applicant was travelling to Samara to take part in the opposition rally “March of dissent” and might be carrying extremist literature. 12. On the same day, as soon as the applicant mounted the train at Nizhniy Novgorod station, three policemen entered his compartment, checked his identity documents and asked him questions about the purpose of his trip. 13. At Saransk station (the Mordoviya Republic) another identity check was conducted and the applicant was again questioned about the purpose of his trip. The policemen ordered the applicant to leave the train and follow them to the police station, but the applicant refused to comply. In the early morning of 14 May 2007, immediately after the train entered the Samara region, the applicant’s identity documents were checked for a third time. 14. When the applicant got off the train in Samara he was stopped by the police. The policemen checked his identity documents and took him to the police station, saying that it was necessary to look up his name in the police databases. They threatened to use force if the applicant refused to comply with their order. 15. The police drew up an attendance report, using a standard template entitled “Attendance report in respect of a person who has committed an administrative offence”. The phrase “who has committed an administrative offence” was struck through by the police officer who filled in the template. The report indicated that the applicant was brought to the police station on 14 May 2007 at 12.15 p.m. It was mentioned that he had been stopped on account of information received in telexes nos. TP 1149 and 26/4T2021 of 13 May 2007. He was questioned about the purpose of his trip and his acquaintances in Samara. He was released on the same day at 1 p.m. 16. It follows from the submissions by the police officer who escorted the applicant to the police station that he had received information from his superiors that the applicant intended to participate in an opposition rally and might be carrying extremist literature. He had stopped the applicant and escorted him to the police station in order to prevent him from committing administrative and criminal offences. He had warned the applicant that if he refused to comply, force would be used. He had asked the applicant questions about the purpose of his visit to Samara. The applicant had denied involvement in any extremist activities. He had not been searched because he had no luggage and it was clear that he was not carrying any extremist materials. 17. The applicant lodged complaints with the prosecutor’s offices of Nizhniy Novgorod, Mordoviya Republic and Samara Region. 18. On 15 June 2007 the Nizhniy Novgorod Transport Prosecutor’s Office refused to initiate criminal proceeding against the policemen who had questioned the applicant in Nizhniy Novgorod, finding that the applicant had voluntarily submitted to the identity check and questioning. 19. On 12 July 2007 the Ruzayevka Transport Prosecutor’s Office (the Mordoviya Republic) refused to initiate criminal proceedings against the policemen who had allegedly questioned the applicant at Saransk station. It found that on 13 May 2007 the Ruzaevka police station had received telex no. 26/4-T-2021 from the Volgo-Vyatskiy Interior Department of Transport, containing information that the applicant was going to Samara by train with the intention of taking part in an opposition rally and that he was suspected of carrying extremist literature. The police had searched the train but could not find the applicant. 20. On 23 July 2007 the Kuybyshevskiy Transport Prosecutor’s Office refused to open criminal proceedings against the policemen who had stopped the applicant in Samara. The prosecutor’s office found that the policemen had acted lawfully, in accordance with sections 2 and 10 of the Police Act (see paragraph 33 below). In particular, they had received information (telex no. 26/4-T-2021) about the applicant’s intention to participate in an opposition rally. There had therefore been reasons to believe that he might be involved in the commission of administrative offences, and it had been necessary to stop him and bring him to the police station. 21. On 24 May 2007 the applicant brought an action against the Volgo-Vyatskiy Interior Department of Transport before the Kanavinskiy District Court of Nizhniy Novgorod. He claimed that the telexes sent by the Volgo-Vyatskiy Interior Department of Transport to the local offices, requiring them to stop the applicant, check his identity documents and question him, had been unlawful for the following reasons: - There had been no reason to check his documents or question him, as the police already had information about his identity, and the date and time of his arrival in and departure from Samara; - There could be no suspicion of his intention to engage in any unlawful activities as, firstly, the rallies in Samara had been duly authorised by the town council and, secondly, he had planned to leave Samara before the date scheduled for the rallies; - His name had been entered in the police database unlawfully, without prior judicial authorisation. 22. He further complained about his allegedly unlawful arrest and one-hour detention at the police station in Samara. He claimed that all the above actions had violated his right to respect for private life and his right to liberty and security, and had interfered with his human rights activities. 23. The Kanavinskiy District Court declared the application inadmissible, finding that the applicant had failed to submit supporting documents. This decision was subsequently quashed by the Supreme Court and the case was remitted to the Kanavinskiy District Court. 24. At the hearing the representative of the Volgo-Vyatskiy Interior Department of Transport testified that the applicant’s name had been registered in the Surveillance Database following an order from the Interior Department of the Nizhniy Novgorod Region. The police had therefore been entitled to take measures against him as specified in the Police Act and the Operative-Search Act. As to the identity checks in the Mordovia Republic and Samara Region, the Volgo-Vyatskiy Interior Department of Transport had no territorial jurisdiction over these local police offices. 25. At the applicant’s request the Interior Department of the Nizhniy Novgorod Region was joined as a co-respondent to the proceedings. Its representative informed the court that commission of criminal or administrative offences by a person was not a prerequisite for inclusion of his name in the Surveillance Database. The applicant’s name had been registered in that database on the basis of confidential information. 26. On 29 May 2008 the Kanavinskiy District Court dismissed the application. It found that section 11 § 4 of the Police Act and sections 2, 5, 6 and 7 §§ 2 (b) and 4 of the Operative-Search Act (see paragraphs 34 to 38 below) gave the police powers to check documents and question citizens in certain cases. In the applicant’s case the identity checks and the questioning had been justified by the fact that his name was registered in the Surveillance Database. The applicant had voluntarily replied to the questions asked by the police officers. No force or coercion had been used against him by the police officers in Nizhniy Novgorod. The Volgo-Vyatskiy Interior Department of Transport was not liable for the measures taken against the applicant by the police officers in the Mordoviya Republic and Saransk Region [the domestic court apparently meant Samara region], as it had no territorial jurisdiction over those regions. Finally, the court rejected the applicant’s request for an injunction to the Volgo-Vyatskiy Interior Department of Transport to delete his personal data from the police databases. The court found that the applicant’s personal data had been collected by the Interior Department of the Nizhniy Novgorod Region rather than by the Volgo-Vyatskiy Interior Department of Transport. 27. The applicant appealed, complaining in particular about insufficient reasoning. He submitted that the District Court had failed to give detailed answers to all his arguments. 28. On 7 October 2008 the Nizhniy Novgorod Regional Court upheld the judgment on appeal, endorsing the reasoning of the District Court. 29. On 8 December 2008 the applicant challenged the decision to register his name in the Surveillance Database before the Nizhegorodskiy District Court of Nizhniy Novgorod. He alleged, in particular, that that decision interfered with his right to respect for private life because it permitted the police to collect information about his trips. He was also regularly questioned by the police about the purpose of his trips, his income, his acquaintances and his political opinions. That interference was not necessary in a democratic society. Firstly, the Interior Ministry’s orders governing the creation and functioning of the Surveillance Database had not been published. Society did not know the procedures for its operation. According to the media, the database contained the names of more than 3,800 persons, the majority of whom were members of human rights and opposition groups. Secondly, the decision to register his name in the database had been arbitrary. He had never been suspected of any criminal or administrative offences, had never been involved in extremist activities and had never supported or called for violence. The registration of his name in the database was apparently connected with his human rights activities and his participation in opposition rallies. He also complained of a violation of his right to liberty. He had been unlawfully stopped by the police several times on the sole ground that his name was registered in the Surveillance Database. 30. On 22 April 2009 the Nizhegorodskiy District Court dismissed the applicant’s claims. It noted that the applicant’s name had been deleted from the database in September 2007. It continued as follows: “The court considers that the Interior Department of the Nizhniy Novgorod Region had grounds for registering [the applicant’s] name in the Surveillance Database. It follows from [the] letter by a deputy head of the Department for Maintaining Order on Transport of the Interior Ministry of Russia that the Surveillance Database pursues the aim of collecting information about the purchase by the persons listed in it of travel tickets to places [where] mass events [are planned]. Thus, the Surveillance Database does not interfere with the private lives of those listed as [the database] contains only data on their trips in connection with their professional or public activities. The registration of a person’s name in the Surveillance Database cannot be considered as breaching his/her rights or freedoms or hindering the exercise of such rights and freedoms or imposing an unlawful obligation or liability. ... [the applicant] is the representative of the Moscow Helsinki Group, a public activist and the head of the Nizhniy Novgorod Human Rights Union. He organises round tables and seminars for human rights activists. In connection with his public activities he travels to many Russian towns. Thus, in May 2007 he travelled to Samara with the aim of investigating the restrictions on public assemblies during the G8 summit in the Samara region. The court considers that, taking into account [the applicant’s] public activities, the Interior Department of the Nizhniy Novgorod Region was entitled to register his name in the Surveillance Database because, in accordance with section 11 § 4 of the Police Act, when discharging their duties the police may require citizens and officials to provide explanations, information or documents...” 31. The Administrative Offences Code provides that a police officer may escort an individual to the police station by force for the purpose of drawing up a report on the administrative offence provided that it is impossible to do it at the place where that offence has been detected. The individual must be released as soon as possible. The police officer must draw up an “attendance report” or refer to the fact of escorting the individual to the station in the report on the administrative offence. The individual concerned must be given a copy of that report (section 27.2 §§ 1 (1), 2 and 3). 32. In exceptional cases a police officer may arrest an individual for a short period if it is necessary to ensure a correct and prompt examination of the administrative case and secure enforcement of the eventual penalty (Article 27.3 § 1 of the Code). The duration of such administrative arrest must not normally exceed three hours (Article 25.5 §§ 1 of the Code). The arresting officer must draw up “an administrative arrest report” (Article 27.4 of the Code). 33. The Police Act of 18 April 1992 (No. 1026-I) provides that the tasks of the police are, inter alia, the prevention and suppression of criminal and administrative offences and protection of public order and public safety (section 2). Their duties include the prevention and suppression of criminal and administrative offences, detection of circumstances conducive to commission of offences and taking measures to obviate such circumstances (section 10 § 1). 34. Section 11 of the Police Act provides that when discharging their duties the police may, in particular: § 2. check citizens’ identity documents if there are sufficient grounds to suspect that they have committed a criminal or administrative offence or have fled from justice; and search citizens and their belongings if there are sufficient reasons to believe that they possess weapons, ammunition, explosives or drugs; § 4. require citizens and officials to provide explanations, information or documents; § 5. arrest persons suspected of administrative offences or persons who have unlawfully entered or attempted to enter a secure area; § 7. arrest persons suspected of a criminal offence or persons who have been remanded in custody by a judicial order; § 8. arrest persons who have fled from justice; § 9. arrest persons who have evaded compulsory medical treatment or educational supervision; § 10. arrest minors suspected of criminal or administrative offences; § 11. arrest persons in a state of alcoholic intoxication if they have lost their ability to walk unaided or could cause harm to others or to themselves (section 11). 35. The Operational-Search Activities Act of 12 August 1995 (no. 144FZ) provides that the aims of operative search activities are: (1) the detection, prevention, suppression and investigation of criminal offences and identification of persons conspiring to commit, or committing, or having committed a criminal offence; (2) finding fugitives from justice and missing persons; (3) obtaining information about events or activities endangering the State, military, economical or ecological security of the Russian Federation (section 2). 36. State officials and organs performing operational-search activities are to show respect for the private and family life, home and correspondence of citizens. It is prohibited to perform operational-search activities to attain aims or objectives other than those specified in this Act (section 5). 37. Operational-search activities include, inter alia, questioning and identity check (section 6). 38. Section 7 of the Operational-Search Activities Act provides that operational-search activities may be conducted, inter alia, on the following grounds: (1) pending criminal proceedings; (2) receipt by the police of information (a) that a criminal offence has been committed or is ongoing, or is being conspired, and about persons conspiring to commit, or committing, or having committed a criminal offence, if this information is insufficient to open criminal proceedings; (b) about events or activities endangering the State, military, economical or ecological security of the Russian Federation; (c) about fugitives from justice; (d) about missing persons or unidentified bodies; ... (4) receipt of a request from another State agency which is performing operational-search activities on the grounds specified in this section (section 7). 39. The Suppression of Extremism Act (Federal Law no. 114-FZ of 25 July 2002) requires State agencies to take preventive measures against extremism to detect and eliminate causes of, and conditions for, extremist activities, as well as measures to detect, prevent and suppress extremist activities conducted by non-profit and religious organisations and persons (section 3). 40. Order no. 980, On measures for enhancement of the automatic information system used by the interior departments of transport, issued by the Interior Ministry on 1 December 1999 (unpublished, a copy was submitted by the Government), directed that a software database code-named “Search-Highway” (“Розыск-Магистраль”) be created and installed. Its purpose was to facilitate discovery of those suspected of criminal offences whose names were on the wanted persons’ list. It was to be linked to the databases of the railway and airline companies, so that whenever any of the persons listed bought a train or airplane ticket an automatic notification was sent to the police, thereby allowing the police to arrest that person. 41. Order No. 1070, On installing the software database “Search-Highway” in the interior departments of transport, issued by the Interior Ministry on 22 December 1999 (unpublished, a copy was submitted by the Government) provided that the database be installed in the first half of 2000. The appendix to that Order established the procedure for its operation. In particular, it established that the following persons should be included in the database: (1) persons on the Interpol Wanted Fugitives list; (2) foreign nationals or stateless persons whose names were put on the wanted persons’ list in connection with criminal offence committed on the territory of the Russian Federation; (3) foreign nationals whose entry into the Russian Federation was prohibited or restricted; (4) persons suspected of the following serious or especially serious offences: unlawful transportation of arms, ammunition or explosives; criminal explosions; unlawful traffic of antiques or their smuggling out of the Russian Federation; premeditated murders; terrorist acts; drug trafficking; financial crimes; (5) leaders of ethnic communities; leaders and active members of organised criminal groups. 42. Order no. 47, On certain measures intended to strengthen the fight against extremism, issued by the Interior Ministry on 14 April 2005 (unpublished), directed that a database of potential extremists be created as a part of the “Search-Highway” database. It was code-named “Surveillance Database” (“Сторожевой контроль”). 43. According to Mr Sh., an officer from the Volgo-Vyatskiy Interior Department of Transport whose affidavit was submitted by the Government, the decision to register a person’s name in the “Surveillance Database” is taken by the Interior Ministry or its regional departments on the basis of confidential information.","['5', '8']",['5-1'],[],[],[],[],1
119,001-105847,ENG,TUR,CHAMBER,2011,CASE OF YAVUZ ÇELİK v. TURKEY,4,Violation of Art. 3 (procedural aspect),András Sajó;David Thór Björgvinsson;Françoise Tulkens;Giorgio Malinverni;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque,"3. The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Istanbul. 4. On 11 August 2006 the Muğla Magistrates’ Court issued an arrest warrant against the applicant in order to obtain his statement in relation to a charge of slander. 5. According to incident reports drawn up at the Üsküdar Doğancılar police station, an officer was sent to the applicant’s house early on 27 October 2006 to execute the arrest warrant. Upon discovering that the applicant was not at home, he left a note inviting him to present himself at the Üsküdar Doğancılar police station to make a statement regarding the charge brought against him. 6. Later the same day, at approximately 2.30 p.m., the applicant telephoned the police station and quarrelled with the officer Y.A. on the phone, arguing that the police had no authority to ask him to go to the police station as he had not received a summons from the court to make a statement. It is indicated in the incident report that the applicant was very aggressive on the phone and that he insulted and threatened officer Y.A. The applicant denied these allegations. 7. Immediately after this phone conversation, three police officers were sent to the applicant’s home to effect his arrest. Upon the applicant’s failure to cooperate and surrender, oral instructions were given from the office of the Üsküdar public prosecutor to make a forcible arrest. A scuffle then ensued between the parties, and the applicant attempted to throw himself off the balcony. He was, however, detained by the police, with the assistance of his neighbour E.A. 8. The applicant was subsequently taken to the Üsküdar Doğancılar police station at approximately 3.30 p.m. According to the police report, the applicant continued to behave aggressively and defiantly at the police station, shouting that the police had no authority to keep him there, and at one point he tried to jump out of the window to escape. The officers, however, managed to grab hold of him and restrained him with handcuffs. The applicant confirmed this, but claimed that he had only attempted to jump out of the window as a reaction to two police officers hitting him on the chest and foot. 9. On 27 October 2006 at 5.20 p.m. the applicant was examined by a doctor at the Haydarpaşa Numune Hospital, who noted no signs of illtreatment on his body. Following the medical examination, the applicant was taken back to the Üsküdar Doğancılar police station. 10. In the meantime, after handing the applicant over to the police station, two of the police officers who had made the arrest, namely M.Al. and M.Ak., underwent a medical examination at the Haydarpaşa Numune Hospital. Slight abrasions were noted on both officers’ right hands. 11. On 27 October 2006 the three police officers who were in charge of the applicant’s arrest, namely M.Al., M.Ak. and M.K., and the police officer the applicant had allegedly insulted on the phone earlier that day, namely Y.A., lodged criminal complaints with the Üsküdar public prosecutor against the applicant, accusing him of resisting police officers on duty and insulting them. In their complaints, they each gave identical accounts of the events that took place prior to and during the applicant’s arrest, which were also consistent with the official incident reports (see paragraphs 6 and 7 above). 12. At approximately 6 p.m. on the same day the applicant’s neighbour E.A., who had witnessed the whole incident and had assisted the police in restraining and arresting the applicant, was asked to testify as a witness. E.A. verified that the applicant had violently resisted arrest, including by shouting insults, whereas the arresting police officers had in no way assaulted or otherwise mistreated him. 13. On an unspecified date the Üsküdar public prosecutor initiated an investigation against the applicant on charges of obstructing police officers in the performance of their duties by insulting and assaulting them (investigation no. 2006/22778). 14. On 28 October 2006 at half past midnight the applicant was questioned at the police station in relation to the charges brought by the police officers. According to the official statement (sanık ifade tutanağı), which he declined to sign, the applicant chose to remain silent and refused the assistance of the lawyer appointed by the Bar Association. He declared that he would make his statement before the public prosecutor. 15. At around noon the same day the applicant was taken to the Üsküdar police headquarters by two police officers, K.B. and Ö.M., for a physical identity check, including the taking of fingerprints. The applicant claimed that when he inquired about the purpose of the identity check, K.B. started swearing at him and then punched him on the nose, eye and cheek and squeezed him by the throat in the yard of the headquarters, while his hands were cuffed behind his back. 16. At 2.45 p.m. on the same day he was referred to the Haydarpaşa Numune Hospital for a medical examination. 17. At 2.55 p.m. a doctor at the Haydarpaşa Numune Hospital examined the applicant and noted an oedema on his nose, hyperaemia of 5 x 5 cm on the right side of his neck, ecchymosis (bruising) of 2 x 1 cm on the left side of his neck, hyperaemia on his right shoulder blade and hyperaemia and abrasion of 1.5 cm on his left shin. An otolaryngologist who examined him at 3.15 p.m. also noted sensitivity on his cervix. No information was provided in the medical reports as to how the indicated injuries might have been sustained by the applicant. 18. The applicant was subsequently brought before the Üsküdar public prosecutor. In his statement, which was made in the presence of his lawyer, the applicant denied the charges against him in relation to the insult and assault of police officers on duty. He lodged a counter-complaint against the officers who had carried out his arrest for trespass and violation of the right to privacy of the home. He also complained that earlier that day he was beaten, strangled and sworn at by a police officer, K.B., outside the Üsküdar police headquarters, where he had been taken for an identity check, and that another officer who had accompanied them, namely Ö.M., had witnessed the incident. After having identified both police officers, who were waiting outside the office of the public prosecutor, he demanded that the public prosecutor initiate an investigation against K.B. for subjecting him to ill-treatment. 19. On 28 October 2006 at 10.30 p.m. the applicant was referred to the Istanbul Forensic Medicine Institute for a further medical examination. The doctor who examined him noted, in a preliminary report, that the applicant complained of having been hit on the face and squeezed around the neck earlier that day, as well as of having his chest crushed the day before during his arrest, on account of which he was suffering breathing problems. The doctor found an ecchymosis on the right side of the applicant’s nose, an ecchymosis of 1 x 0.5 cm on the front left side of the base of his neck and an abrasion of 2 x 2 cm on the front side of his left forearm, just below the joint. He referred the applicant to a specialist in pulmonary diseases before drawing up the final report. This preliminary report was apparently not made available to the applicant. 20. On 30 October 2006 the applicant was examined by a pulmonary specialist, who did not note any damage to his lungs apart from a scar from a previous operation. 21. There is no information in the case file as to the outcome of the investigation against the applicant. 22. On 28 October 2006 the Üsküdar public prosecutor questioned police officer K.B. regarding the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment (investigation no. 2006/23358). K.B. stated that at approximately 11.30 a.m. that day he had taken the applicant to the Üsküdar police headquarters together with officer Ö.M. When the applicant asked why he had been brought there, they explained that the Üsküdar public prosecutor had issued written instructions for him to have a physical identity check for the purposes of the ongoing investigations against him. The applicant thereafter became extremely agitated and starting shouting loudly and swearing. When they tried to get him inside the building, he tried to hurt himself by hitting his head against the front window of the building. K.B. alleged that he then tried to cuff the applicant’s hands behind his back in order to get better hold of him. When the applicant resisted, Ö.M. tried to hold him down by the waist while he stabilised the applicant by putting his neck in an arm-lock and cuffing his hands behind his back. K.B. claimed that some police officers on patrol duty at the relevant time had witnessed these events. K.B. also pressed charges against the applicant on account of the insults and the injuries he had sustained, which consisted of a red line of 3 cm x 5 cm on his right forearm, as had been noted by the public prosecutor. 23. The public prosecutor subsequently took a statement from Ö.M., the police officer who had accompanied K.B. at the time of the impugned incidents. Ö.M., who was also a relative of K.B. by marriage, repeated the latter’s statement. He also claimed that two police officers on duty at the Üsküdar police headquarters had witnessed the events. 24. On 9 November 2006 the public prosecutor heard E.A., the applicant’s neighbour who had witnessed his arrest. E.A. verified his earlier police statement, except for the part about the applicant insulting the police officers, which he claimed had been misrecorded. E.A. stated that the applicant had at no point insulted the police officers, yet he had very strongly resisted arrest. He further stated that the police officers carrying out the arrest had not used excessive force or otherwise ill-treated the applicant. 25. On the same day the Üsküdar public prosecutor issued a decision not to prosecute the accused police officers M.Al., M.Ak., M.K. and K.B. He held that both the applicant and the police officers who had carried out his arrest had sustained slight injuries as a result of the applicant’s aggressive resistance to his arrest on 27 October 2006. However, as E.A. had also confirmed in his witness statement, the police had not used excessive force to effect the arrest. The public prosecutor did not indicate in the decision the medical reports and other evidence he relied on for the purposes of the investigation. 26. On 27 November 2006 the Forensic Medicine Institute delivered its final report regarding the applicant. After repeating the findings of the previous medical reports, it concluded that the injuries observed on the applicant’s body were not life-threatening and could be treated by a simple medical intervention. 27. On 4 December 2006 the applicant objected to the decision of the public prosecutor. The applicant argued, inter alia, that on 28 October 2006 at approximately 1.15 p.m. he had been punched on the face and strangled by police officer K.B., who had cuffed his hands behind his back to render him more defenceless. The injuries he had sustained as a result of this beating had been clearly indicated in the medical report issued by the Haydarpaşa Numune Hospital at 2.55 p.m. that day. The Forensic Medicine Institute, where the public prosecutor had referred him after taking his statement, had also noted his injuries in its preliminary report and had photographed them. However, neither the report of the Forensic Medicine Institute nor the photographs had been submitted to the investigation file at the Üsküdar public prosecutor’s office by the police officer in charge. The applicant asserted that when he had requested the Forensic Medicine Institute’s preliminary report from the public prosecutor’s office, the prosecutor had informed him in person that the report was not in the investigation file. In the absence of this report, his complaints against K.B. regarding the illtreatment he had been subjected to had not been duly examined by the public prosecutor. He further claimed that the public prosecutor had not heard his witnesses regarding the impugned incidents. 28. On 18 January 2007 the Kadıköy Assize Court upheld the decision of the public prosecutor, without responding to the applicant’s specific objections. That decision was served on the applicant on 10 February 2007. 29. On 7 February 2007 the applicant requested from the Forensic Medicine Institute the medical report issued by its Istanbul branch following his examination on 28 October 2006. 30. On 19 February 2007 the Forensic Medicine Institute informed the applicant that a copy of the report containing the findings of his medical examination had been sent to the Üsküdar public prosecutor’s office on the same date as the examination. In the event that it could not be found in the investigation file, a new copy could be supplied at the request of the public prosecutor’s office. It appears that no such request was made by the office of the Üsküdar public prosecutor. 31. In the meantime, on 12 February 2007 the applicant applied to the Üsküdar public prosecutor’s office, requesting, inter alia, that his medical report prepared by the Forensic Medicine Institute, together with the photographs, be found and communicated to him, and that the authorities responsible for concealing these documents be punished. He also demanded an explanation as to why K.B. had been charged with “excessive use of force” rather than “ill-treatment” and why the public prosecutor had heard evidence from a witness called by the police against him, E.A., but not accepted the examination of witnesses on his behalf. The applicant did not receive a reply from the public prosecutor’s office. 32. On 29 May 2007 the applicant applied once again to the Üsküdar public prosecutor’s office for the medical report issued by the Forensic Medicine Institute, which was not available in the investigation file. It appears that he did not receive a reply to this request either. 33. In the meantime, administrative proceedings were also initiated against the police officers who had effected the applicant’s arrest, namely M.Al., M.Ak., M.K. and Y.A. It appears that no administrative action was taken against K.B. in respect of the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment. 34. On an unspecified date the chief superintendent officer in charge of the investigation submitted an investigation report, in which he expressed the opinion that the officers involved in the applicant’s arrest had acted strictly under orders from the public prosecutor and had not committed any offences which required disciplinary action. 35. On 8 January 2007 the Üsküdar District Governor’s Office discontinued the investigation against the police officers on the basis of the report of the chief superintendent officer.",['3'],[],[],[],[],[],1

ITALY,4,Violation of P1-1;Violation of Art. 6-1;Pecuniary damage - financial award;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - domestic proceedings;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings,Christos Rozakis,"4. The applicant was born in 1940 and lives in Salerno. 5. He is the owner of a flatt in Salerno, which he had let to R.C. 6. In a writ served on the tenant on 3 May 1990, the applicant informed the tenant of his intention to terminate the lease on expiry of the term on 30 November 1990 and summoned her to appear before the Salerno Magistrate. 7. By a decision of 15 May 1990, which was made enforceable on 1 June 1990, the Salerno Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 31 December 1991. 8. On 28 January 1992, the applicant served notice on the tenant requiring her to vacate the premises. 9. On 6 April 1992, he served notice on the tenant informing her that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 21 April 1992. 10. On 21 April 1992 the bailiff made one attempt to recover possession that proved unsuccessful as, under the statutory provisions providing for the suspension, the applicant was not entitled to police assistance in enforcing the order for possession. 11. On 27 January 1997, the applicant made a statutory declaration that he urgently required the premises as accommodation for himself. 12. Pursuant to article 6 of Law no. 431/98, the Salerno Magistrate suspended the eviction proceedings until 19 November 1999. 13. On 20 October 1999, he served a second notice on the tenant informing her that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 19 November 1999. 14. On 19 November 1999, the applicant recovered possession of the flat. 15. Since 1947 the public authorities in Italy have frequently intervened in residential tenancy legislation with the aim of controlling rents. This has been achieved by rent freezes (occasionally relaxed when the Government decreed statutory increases), by the statutory extension of all current leases and by the postponement, suspension or staggering of the enforcement of orders for possession. The relevant domestic law concerning the extension of tenancies, the suspension of enforcement and the staggering of evictions is described in the Court's judgment in the case of Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, §§ 18-35, ECHR 1999-V. 16. As regards the control of the rents, the evolution of the Italian legislation may be summarised as follows. 17. The first relevant measure was the Law no. 392 of 27 July 1978 which provided machinery for “fair rents” (the so-called equo canone) on the basis of a number of criteria such as the surface of the flat and its costs of realisation. 18. The second step of the Italian authorities dated August 1992. It was taken in the view of progressive liberalisation of the market of tenancies. Accordingly, a legislation relaxing on rent levels restrictions (the so-called patti in deroga) entered into force. Owners and tenants were in principle given the opportunity to derogate from the rent imposed by law and to agree on a different price. 19. Lastly, Law no. 431 of 9 December 1998 reformed the tenancies and liberalised the rents. 20. The tenant is under a general obligation to refund the owner any damages caused in the case of late restitution of the flat. In this regard, Article 1591 of the Italian Civil Code provides: “The tenant who fails to vacate the immovable property is under an obligation to pay the owner the agreed amount until the date when he leaves, together with other remaining damages.” 21. However, Law no. 61 of 1989 set out, inter alia, a limit to the compensation claimable by the owner entitling him to a sum equal to the rent paid by the tenant at the time of the expiration of the lease, proportionally increased according to the cost of living (Article 24 of Law no. 392 of 27 July 1978) plus 20%, along the period of inability to dispose of the possession of the flat. 22. In the judgment no. 482 of 2000, the Constitutional Court was called upon to decide whether such a limitation complied with the Constitution. The Constitutional Court held that it was compatible with the Constitution with regard to periods of time during which the suspension of the evictions was determined by law. The Constitutional Court explained that the introduction of that limitation was intended to settle the tenancies of the time of the emergency legislation, when the housing shortage made the suspension of the enforcement necessary. While evictions were suspended ex lege, the law predetermined the quantum of the reimbursement chargeable to the tenant, both measures being temporary and exceptional. Besides, the interests of the owner were counterbalanced by the exemption for him from the burden to prove the damages. 23. The Constitutional Court declared the limitation to the compensation claimable by the owner unconstitutional with regard to cases where the impossibility for the owner to repossess the flat depended on the conduct of the tenant and was not due to a legislative intervention. Accordingly, it opened the way to owners for the institution of civil proceedings in order to obtain full reparation of the damages caused by the tenant.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1
121,001-83472,ENG,GBR,CHAMBER,2007,CASE OF O'DOWD v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,2,Violation of Art. 2 (lack of independence of the investigating body during the initial stages of the investigation);Not necessary to examine Art. 13;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings,Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza,"6. The first applicant Bernard O'Dowd, who was born in 1923 and lives in Drumnee, County Meath, Ireland, was the father of Barry O'Dowd and Declan O'Dowd. The second applicant Michael Gabriel O'Dowd, who was born in 1951 and lives in Bleary, was the son of Joseph O'Dowd. 7. On the evening of 4 January 1976, the first applicant was hosting a family get-together at his home in Ballydougan, County Down. At about 6.30 p.m. three masked gunmen forced their way into the house. Barry O'Dowd, Declan O'Dowd and Joseph O'Dowd were shot and killed. The first applicant was hit by nine bullets but survived. About thirty shots were fired during the incident. No organisation claimed responsibility for their deaths. The same night an attack was launched on the home of another Catholic family in Armagh, in which John and Brian Reavey were killed and Anthony Reavey was injured. 8. The three men were believed to have made their getaway in a Morris 1300 car, 3315XZ, stolen earlier from Robert Street, Lurgan. 9. The emergency services – police and ambulance – arrived within a short time. Detectives and Scene of Crime Officers commenced investigations. Post-mortems were held. House to house inquiries were conducted in the area and along the suspected getaway route with negative results. Nineteen spent bullet cases were recovered at the scene and the weapon used was identified as one used in four other attacks. Numerous witnesses were interviewed, including members of the family who were interviewed at length. Ronan O'Dowd stated that he had observed two men standing beside a red car, possibly a “1300”, close to the house, both men were masked and had “walkie talkie” radios. Cathal O'Dowd stated that he had observed a blue coloured “Viva” car near the house that afternoon. 10. Several days before the attack, Ronan O'Dowd had seen masked men running up a lane adjacent to the house, in what the applicants believed was a dummy run for the attack. The family also recollected seeing officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (“RUC”) and Ulster Defence Regiment (“UDR”) in fields near the house the day before the attack, which was an unusual occurrence. 11. Police inquiries revealed that a red Morris 1300 had been stolen from Lurgan on 4 January 1976; it was found burnt out on 5 January 1976. Inquiries in Lurgan proved negative. No further information was received on the “Viva” car. 12. Three men were arrested by the police on 5 January 1976 and questioned about the murders. They were released on 8 January 1976 and no charges were preferred. 13. On 20 January 2006, the first applicant stated that one man who had entered the house was similar in appearance to a man whom he named. The man was arrested, questioned but eliminated from the inquiry following verification of his alibi. 14. In May-June 1976, the police questioned the first applicant and asked him to identify a weapon. He identified the weapon as one used in the attack. He was told that it was linked to Robin Jackson, a prominent loyalist paramilitary and to a number of other loyalist attacks. 15. An Inquest held on 11 February 1977 returned open verdicts. 16. After 1976 there were no further developments in the O'Dowd murders until 1999 when John Weir made allegations of police involvement in a range of loyalist terrorist incidents including the attack on the O'Dowds. 17. In the course of an investigation in 1978, the police had arrested a reserve police constable, William McCaughey, who, in the course of questioning, revealed his part in the abduction of a priest and in a variety of other loyalist paramilitary incidents. McCaughey's revelations gave rise to investigations in eleven specific cases, some of which were linked in terms of the identities of those involved, the modus operandi or by virtue of the ballistics examinations of weapons used. Nine suspects were arrested in total, including five police officers and all were eventually charged with offences. 18. One of those implicated was a police officer John Weir who was named as having been involved in the murder of a shopkeeper called Strathearn in Ahoghill in April 1977: he was convicted for that murder in June 1980 and sentenced to life imprisonment. The Government stated that both McCaughey and Weir refused to name the two loyalist paramilitaries also involved with them in the murder unless they received immunity from prosecution. The police and prosecuting authority took the decision prior to the trial not to enter into any process of bargaining with Weir and McCaughey. While both were approached by the police after their convictions to see if at that stage they would give evidence against the loyalist paramilitaries, each again refused to do so unless there was something in it for themselves. The Government stated that during the period in which Weir was detained he was interviewed on a large number of occasions. At no time did he implicate himself or others in any offence other than the Strathearn murder. 19. On 1 February 1993, John Weir was released from prison on licence. In January 1999, he made a statement to a journalist alleging RUC and Ulster Defence Regiment (“UDR”) collusion with loyalist paramilitaries from the Portadown area in the mid-1970s. This statement was published in the Sunday Times newspaper in March 1999. It was obtained by the Patrick Finucane Centre, a human rights non-governmental organisation in Derry (“the Centre”). 20. John Weir's statement made detailed allegations about security force collusion with loyalist paramilitaries in a series of incidents. He alleged inter alia that RUC Reserve Constable Laurence McClure had told him that Robin Jackson had carried out the murders in the O'Dowd home and that the attack had been co-ordinated with the attack on the Reavey family the same night in which security force personnel participated directly. The statement also made links between these incidents and other attacks allegedly carried out by members of the security forces, both RUC and UDR, and loyalist paramilitaries. This group used the farmhouse in Glennane owned by James Mitchell, a RUC reservist, as a base from which to carry out attacks on Catholics and nationalists. Other attacks allegedly included the murder of John and Brian Reavey and wounding of Anthony Reavey in their home on 4 January 1976 (see application no. 34640/04); the murder of Colm McCartney and Sean Farmer at a bogus vehicle checkpoint in August 1975 (see application no. 34575/04); the attack on Donnelly's Bar in which Trevor Brecknell, Michael Donnelly and Patrick Donnelly were killed (see application no. 32457/04); and the attack on the Rock Bar in which Michael McGrath was seriously injured (see application no. 34561/04). Weir also linked these attacks to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in which 33 people were killed in the Republic of Ireland. 21. On or about 10 June 1999, RTE, an Irish television channel, broadcast a television programme that contained allegations of security force involvement in a number of deaths, including that of Trevor Brecknell. Weir made allegations on that programme that members of the RUC and UDR were directly involved in the attack on Donnelly's Bar. A BBC Spotlight programme produced a similar documentary dealing with these allegations. 22. These allegations attracted considerable attention on both sides of the Irish border and became the subject of police investigation in both jurisdictions. The Government stated that the police investigation in Northern Ireland was focussed on determining whether Weir's allegations should be assessed as sufficiently credible to require a full investigation. They obtained from the journalist an edited transcript of the interview with Weir. While his whereabouts were unknown to the RUC, Weir met with senior Irish police officers at the Irish Embassy on 15 April 1999. A copy of his statement was provided by the Garda to the RUC, along with a further statement made by Weir to another journalist dated 3 February 1999. The police analysed the available materials and sought to identify the personalities to be interviewed. It became apparent that some had died and that others, living abroad, could not be traced. A series of seven interviews were conducted, under cautions, between July and December 2001, of those individuals central to Weir's account who could be traced. No charges were preferred. The interviews followed the format of Weir's allegations being put to the interviewee for his or her response. The predominant response was denial of any involvement and claims that Weir had been untruthful. No admissions were made by any interviewee. Interviews were also conducted with less central personalities and with police officers involved in interviewing Weir in 1978. The latter stated that Weir had not mentioned the matters now being alleged. 23. Meetings were held regularly with RUC counterparts in the Republic of Ireland. The RUC co-operated also with the judicial inquiry established in the Republic of Ireland into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings (see the description of the inquiry in the case of Brecknell referred to above). Amongst matters about which the RUC team provided information to the inquiry was ballistics information which linked some of the weapons used to more than one incident. In February 2000 a substantial report was compiled by the RUC for the Garda dealing with Weir's allegations. It profiled Weir and dealt inter alia with a description of the 1978 investigation into McCaughey, Weir and others. It concluded that the investigation would continue but that his credibility was in doubt. According to the Government, despite inquiries being conducted, Weir's whereabouts could not be traced. This report was not disclosed as the investigation was continuing. An internal RUC report dated 27 February 2001 concluded that it would be necessary to interview Weir before any view could be finalised in respect of the credibility of his allegations: such interview was not possible as his whereabouts were not known. The report noted the absence of any previous mention of the allegations before 1999 and that much of what he said was hearsay and speculation. Inquiries made of the British Embassy in Nigeria (where he had a known address) and the criminal intelligence service and others failed to locate Weir. Contact was made with the Garda and the secretariat of the Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings without positive result. 24. The Serious Crime Review Team (“SCRT”) was established in March 2004, with responsibilities including the review of all historical murders by way of case assessment for evidential and investigative opportunities. A preliminary case assessment was carried out by a detective chief inspector, who audited all known information and documentation. 25. In light of the preliminary assessment, the case was referred to the Historical Enquiry Team (HET). On 28 April 2006, a Senior Investigating Officer reported on the further review; a number of potential lines of enquiry were identified and recommendations made, including that the HET should extensively interview Weir. This recommendation was approved. The HET director of Investigations, Detective Chief Superintendent James of the London Metropolitan Police Force, took over personal supervision of the investigation which has progressed through the first three of five stages of the HET process (collection of all relevant material; assessment of the investigations to date; review of evidence, with intelligence and open and non-police sources together with a meeting with the families of the victims of the attack). As a number of investigative opportunities were identified and to be followed up, the case was to continue to be processed by HET, which had been put in touch with Weir by the Centre. The Government submitted that if any evidence of police involvement in the murders was found, the Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland would then become involved. The Government have provided recent information that Weir finally agreed to meet with the HET in Dublin; he refused, however, to make a written statement or to give evidence in court. 26. There has been contact between the police and family members, their solicitors or the Centre. In particular, there were meetings in September 2002 with Detective Chief Inspector Paterson, and a meeting with the Chief Constable in June and August 2004; members of HET met with families or their representatives on 29 March and 31 May 2006; and there has also been extensive correspondence with the families or their representatives.

122,001-57420,ENG,IRL,CHAMBER,1979,CASE OF AIREY v. IRELAND,2,Violation of Art. 6-1;Violation of Art. 8;Just satisfaction reserved,,"Particular facts of the case 8. Mrs. Johanna Airey, an Irish national born in 1932, lives in Cork. She comes from a humble family background and went to work at a young age as a shop assistant. She married in 1953 and has four children, the youngest of whom is still dependent on her. At the time of the adoption of the Commission’s report, Mrs. Airey was in receipt of unemployment benefit from the State but, since July 1978, she has been employed. Her net weekly wage in December 1978 was £39.99. In 1974, she obtained a court order against her husband for payment of maintenance of £20 per week, which was increased in 1977 to £27 and in 1978 to £32. However, Mr. Airey, who had previously been working as a lorry driver but was subsequently unemployed, ceased paying such maintenance in May 1978. Mrs. Airey alleges that her husband is an alcoholic and that, before 1972, he frequently threatened her with, and occasionally subjected her to, physical violence. In January 1972, in proceedings instituted by the applicant, Mr. Airey was convicted by the District Court of Cork City of assaulting her and fined. In the following June he left the matrimonial home; he has never returned there to live, although Mrs. Airey now fears that he may seek to do so. 9. For about eight years prior to 1972, Mrs. Airey tried in vain to conclude a separation agreement with her husband. In 1971, he declined to sign a deed prepared by her solicitor for the purpose and her later attempts to obtain his co-operation were also unsuccessful. Since June 1972, she has been endeavouring to obtain a decree of judicial separation on the grounds of Mr. Airey’s alleged physical and mental cruelty to her and their children, and has consulted several solicitors in this connection. However, she has been unable, in the absence of legal aid and not being in a financial position to meet herself the costs involved, to find a solicitor willing to act for her. In 1976, Mrs. Airey applied to an ecclesiastical tribunal for annulment of her marriage. Her application is still under investigation; if successful, it will not affect her civil status. Domestic law 10. In Ireland, although it is possible to obtain under certain conditions a decree of nullity - a declaration by the High Court that a marriage was null and void ab initio -, divorce in the sense of dissolution of a marriage does not exist. In fact, Article 41.3.2o of the Constitution provides: ""No law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage."" However, spouses may be relieved from the duty of cohabiting either by a legally binding deed of separation concluded between them or by a court decree of judicial separation (also known as a divorce a mensa et thoro). Such a decree has no effect on the existence of the marriage in law. It can be granted only if the petitioner furnishes evidence proving one of three specified matrimonial offences, namely, adultery, cruelty or unnatural practices. The parties will call and examine witnesses on this point. By virtue of section 120 (2) of the Succession Act 1965, an individual against whom a decree of judicial separation is granted forfeits certain succession rights over his or her spouse’s estate. 11. Decrees of judicial separation are obtainable only in the High Court. The parties may conduct their case in person. However, the Government’s replies to questions put by the Court (see paragraph 7 above) reveal that in each of the 255 separation proceedings initiated in Ireland in the period from January 1972 to December 1978, without exception, the petitioner was represented by a lawyer. In its report of 9 March 1978, the Commission noted that the approximate range of the costs incurred by a legally represented petitioner was £500 - £700 in an uncontested action and £800 - £1,200 in a contested action, the exact amount depending on such factors as the number of witnesses and the complexity of the issues involved. In the case of a successful petition by a wife, the general rule is that the husband will be ordered to pay all costs reasonably and properly incurred by her, the precise figure being fixed by a Taxing Master. Legal aid is not at present available in Ireland for the purpose of seeking a judicial separation, nor indeed for any civil matters. In 1974, a Committee on Civil Legal Aid and Advice was established under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Pringle. It reported to the Government in December 1977, recommending the introduction of a comprehensive scheme of legal aid and advice in this area. At the hearings on 22 February 1979, counsel for the Government informed the Court that the Government had decided in principle to introduce legal aid in family-law matters and that it was hoped to have the necessary measures taken before the end of 1979. 12. Since Mrs. Airey’s application to the Commission, the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976 has come into force. Section 22 (1) of the Act provides: ""On application to it by either spouse, the court may, if it is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the safety or welfare of that spouse or of any dependent child of the family requires it, order the other spouse, if he is residing at a place where the applicant spouse or that child resides, to leave that place, and whether the other spouse is or is not residing at that place, prohibit him from entering that place until further order by the court or until such other time as the court shall specify."" Such an order - commonly known as a barring order - is not permanent and application may be made at any time for its discharge (section 22 (2)). Furthermore, the maximum duration of an order given in the District Court - as opposed to the Circuit Court or the High Court - is three months although provision is made for renewal. A wife who has been assaulted by her husband may also institute summary criminal proceedings.","['6', '8']",['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1
123,001-61263,ENG,AUT,CHAMBER,2003,CASE OF KARNER v. AUSTRIA,1,Government's request to strike out refused;Violation of Art. 14+8;Costs and expenses partial award,Christos Rozakis,"10. The applicant was born in 1955 and lived in Vienna. 11. From 1989 the applicant lived with Mr W., with whom he had a homosexual relationship, in a flat in Vienna, which the latter had rented a year earlier. They shared the expenses on the flat. 12. In 1991 Mr W. discovered that he was infected with the Aids virus. His relationship with the applicant continued. In 1993, when Mr W. developed Aids, the applicant nursed him. In 1994 Mr W. died after designating the applicant as his heir. 13. In 1995 the landlord of the flat brought proceedings against the applicant for termination of the tenancy. On 6 January 1996 the Favoriten District Court (Bezirksgericht) dismissed the action. It considered that section 14(3) of the Rent Act (Mietrechtsgesetz), which provided that family members had a right to succeed to a tenancy, was also applicable to a homosexual relationship. 14. On 30 April 1996 the Vienna Regional Civil Court (Landesgericht für Zivilrechtssachen) dismissed the landlord's appeal. It found that section 14(3) of the Rent Act was intended to protect persons who had lived together for a long time without being married against sudden homelessness. It applied to homosexuals as well as to persons of opposite sex. 15. On 5 December 1996 the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof) granted the landlord's appeal, quashed the lower court's decision and terminated the lease. It found that the notion of “life companion” (Lebensgefährte) in section 14(3) of the Rent Act was to be interpreted as at the time it was enacted, and the legislature's intention in 1974 was not to include persons of the same sex. 16. On 26 September 2000 the applicant died. 17. On 11 November 2001 the applicant's lawyer informed the Court of the applicant's death and that his mother had waived her right to succeed to the estate. He asked the Court not to strike the application out of its list before the public notary handling the applicant's estate had traced other heirs. 18. On 10 April 2002 the applicant's lawyer informed the Court that the public notary had instigated enquiries in order to trace previously unknown heirs who might wish to succeed to the estate. 19. Section 14 of the Rent Act (Mietrechtsgesetz) reads as follows: “Right to a tenancy in the event of death (1) The death of the landlord or a tenant shall not terminate a tenancy. (2) On the death of the main tenant of a flat, the persons designated in subsection (3) as being entitled to succeed to the tenancy shall do so, to the exclusion of other persons entitled to succeed to the estate, unless they have notified the landlord within fourteen days of the main tenant's death that they do not wish to continue the tenancy. On succeeding to the tenancy, the new tenants shall assume liability for the rent and any obligations that arose during the tenancy of the deceased main tenant. If more than one person is entitled to succeed, they shall succeed jointly to the tenancy and become jointly and severally liable. (3) The following shall be entitled to succeed to the tenancy for the purposes of subsection (2): a spouse, a life companion, relatives in the direct line including adopted children, and siblings of the former tenant, in so far as such persons have a pressing need for accommodation and have already lived in the accommodation with the tenant as members of the same household. For the purposes of this provision, 'life companion' shall mean a person who has lived in the flat with the former tenant until the latter's death for at least three years, sharing a household on an economic footing like that of a marriage; a life companion shall be deemed to have lived in the flat for three years if he or she moved into the flat together with the former tenant at the outset.”","['14', '8']",[],[],[],[],[],1

The applicants were born in 1938, 1968 and 1978 respectively and live in Maryivka. 6. On 29 April 2003 the first applicant requested the Kompaniyivsky District Police to take Vasiliy Mikhalkov, born in 1963, her son and the brother of the second and third applicants, to a sobering-up facility because of his severe alcohol intoxication. Two police officers, S. and P., arrived in response to her call. According to the first applicant, they mocked and kicked Vasiliy Mikhalkov, notwithstanding the first applicant's protests, dragged him into their police car and took him to the police station. 7. On 30 April 2003 the first applicant went to the police station and discovered that Vasiliy Mikhalkov was dead. 8. Following an autopsy, on 14 May 2003 it was established that Vasiliy Mikhalkov had died on 29 April 2003 of an acute internal haemorrhage and the laceration of the small intestine resulting from abdominal trauma sustained on the same date. 9. In the meantime, on 10 May 2003 the Kompaniyivsky District Prosecutor's Office refused to institute criminal proceedings into the incident. On 2 June 2003 this decision was quashed and the case remitted for further inquiry. 10. On 9 June 2003 a post-mortem forensic assessment of Vasiliy Mikhalkov's body confirmed the earlier conclusion concerning the cause of his death. It was also established that the abdominal injury could have resulted from a fall on to a blunt object, such as a kerb or a concrete pole. Other injuries found on his arms, legs and buttocks could have resulted from his body being dragged. 11. Following this assessment, on 10 June 2003 the Kompaniyivsky District Prosecutor's Office took a fresh decision not to initiate criminal proceedings. 12. On 20 June 2003 the Kompaniyivsky District Prosecutors' Office annulled this decision and initiated criminal proceedings into the circumstances of Vasiliy Mikhalkov's death. This investigation is currently under way. 13. The applicants have provided no documents concerning the course of the investigation, maintaining that they had been denied access to the case file and any meaningful opportunity to participate in the proceedings, regardless of their repeated complaints to various authorities, including the General Prosecutor's Office. By way of response, the General Prosecutor's Office kept forwarding their complaints to the Kirovograd Regional Prosecutor's Office, which assured the applicants, without providing any details, that the criminal proceedings were well under way. On several occasions the first applicant requested a meeting with the employees of the Prosecutors' Office to discuss the progress of the case; however, her requests were not accommodated. 14. On 16 December 2003 the first applicant lodged a complaint with the Pechersky District Court of Kyiv, seeking to oblige the General Prosecutor's Office to ensure meaningful monitoring of the proceedings and to address omissions by the local authorities. She claimed, in particular, that there was sufficient evidence to charge two named police officers with abuse of position and a violent assault on her son. 15. On 23 April 2004 the court dismissed this claim. It found, in particular, that the investigation was pending, the necessary investigative measures were under way, the persons responsible for inflicting injuries on her son had not yet been identified, the Regional Prosecutor's Office was monitoring the proceedings and the General Prosecutor's Office had referred the applicants' complaints to the local prosecutorial authorities for reacting. On 13 August 2004 and 10 October 2007 the Kyiv Regional Court of Appeal and the Higher Administrative Court respectively dismissed the first applicant's appeals. 16. The Government likewise provided no documents concerning the investigation of Vasiliy Mikhalkov's death, referring to the confidentiality of documents concerning a pending investigation. They noted, however, that in the course of the investigation eighteen witnesses had been questioned, two reconstructions of the crime scene were conducted and six expert assessments were carried out. They further provided summaries of the findings of the expert assessments. 17. According to the Government's submissions, the expert assessment of 23 October 2003 established that Vasiliy Mikhalkov's death had been directly caused by the internal abdominal injury and acute haemorrhage. These injuries could have resulted from his fall. 18. On 12 December 2003 a further expert assessment confirmed the results of the previous assessments. 19. On 12 May 2004 a further expert assessment established that the injury had been inflicted by the impact, of considerable force, of a blunt object with limited contact surface, possibly a booted foot, hitting the applicant's abdomen at an acute angle. This injury could not have resulted from a simple fall on to a flat or convex surface. 20. On 23 January 2006 a further expert assessment concluded that the injury could have been inflicted in the circumstances described by the first applicant. 21. On 11 February 2008 a further expert assessment suggested that the injury could have resulted from the cumulative impact of various kicks, possibly under the circumstances described by the first applicant. 22. On 6 April 2009 a further expert assessment was ordered to examine in detail how the injuries on Vasiliy Mikhalkov's legs and arms were incurred. This expert assessment was followed by an order of a further expert assessment on 8 June 2010, which is currently underway. 23. The relevant provisions of the Constitution and the Code of Criminal Procedure can be found in the judgment in the case of Sergey Shevchenko v.

125,001-90234,ENG,SWE,CHAMBER,2008,CASE OF KHURSHID MUSTAFA AND TARZIBACHI v. SWEDEN,3,Violation of Art. 10;Pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage - award,Corneliu Bîrsan;Egbert Myjer;Elisabet Fura;Josep Casadevall;Luis López Guerra,"5. The applicants, a married couple of Iraqi origin, were born in 1957 and 1963 respectively and live in Västerås. They have three children, who are now eighteen, sixteen and eight years of age. 6. From 1 November 1999 they rented a flat in Rinkeby, a suburb of Stockholm. Rule 13 of the special provisions of the tenancy agreement stipulated the following: “The tenant undertakes not to erect, without specific permission, placards, signs, sunblinds, outdoor aerials and such like on the house.” The agreement further stipulated, as a general condition, that the tenants were obliged to take proper care of the flat and to maintain good sanitary conditions, order and good practice in the house. 7. It appears that when the applicants moved in, there was a satellite dish mounted on the façade, next to one of the windows of the flat. The applicants made use of this in order to receive television programmes in Arabic and Farsi. 8. In October 2003 the applicants' landlord changed. The new landlord, a real-estate company, demanded that the satellite dish be dismantled. The applicants did not comply and, by letter of 2 April 2004, the company gave the applicants notice of termination of the tenancy agreement with effect from 31 July 2004. 9. Further, in April 2004, the landlord initiated proceedings before the Rent Review Board (hyresnämnden) in Stockholm against the applicants and some other tenants who had installed satellite dishes in the same house. The landlord sought execution of the notice of termination, claiming that the applicants' satellite installation violated the express ban in Rule 13 of the tenancy agreement and that, by not complying with the instruction to dismantle the dish, they had failed to maintain good sanitary conditions, order and good practice. Stating that it objected only to satellite dishes mounted on or outside the façade of the house, while allowing, for instance, dishes placed on a balcony, the landlord claimed that the ban on such installations was of considerable importance as the installations a) risked causing injuries to persons and property for which the landlord would be held responsible, b) damaged the house physically and aesthetically and c) obstructed rescue workers' and the landlord's access to the flat. 10. Shortly after having received the notice of termination, the applicants dismantled the satellite dish. However, in its place they installed a new device by placing on the kitchen floor an iron stand from which an arm, on which the satellite dish was mounted, extended through a small open window. The installation could be pulled back into the kitchen when not being used. At the request of the Tenants' Association, an engineer, Mr S. Tornefelt, examined the installation on 26 August 2004. He found that it was very stable but recommended that, for safety reasons, a steel wire be fixed between the dish and the stand. The applicants made the recommended addition. 11. The applicants, as well as the other tenants summoned, contested the landlord's claims before the Rent Review Board. They stated that, by mounting satellite dishes for the reception of television programmes, some of which were broadcast in their mother tongues, they were exercising their freedom to receive information, as protected by the Swedish Constitution, Article 10 of the Convention and EC law. The landlord's interests, as provided for in Chapter 12, section 25 of the Land Code (Jordabalken), had to be balanced against this freedom. The applicants further claimed that they had now complied with the landlord's demand that the earlier satellite installation be dismantled. The new installation was, they claimed, in conformity with the rules of the tenancy agreement. Referring to Mr Tornefelt's opinion, they further maintained that it was safe and did not damage the house. The landlord submitted, in addition to what it had previously stated, that it was working on the possibility of installing broadband and internet access in the house, which would allegedly give access to the desired television channels. 12. Following an inspection of the applicants' satellite installation, the Rent Review Board gave a decision on 21 October 2004 finding in their favour. The Board noted in general that the assessment of whether tenants had failed to comply with their obligations by mounting satellite dishes had to involve the balancing of the interests of the landlord – which could be more or less strong depending on how the actual installations had been made – and the interests of the tenants in using a satellite dish – which could also vary depending on whether there were alternative means of receiving the television channels in question. In the applicants' case, the Board found that the fact that the new satellite installation extended through a window did not involve a breach of Rule 13 of the tenancy agreement. With regard to the general obligation to maintain good sanitary conditions, order and good practice in the house, the Board considered that the actual installation did not and could not damage the house. Moreover, the landlord's liability for damage to persons and property could not reasonably be incurred unless it were able to prevent the mounting and use of the satellite dish, which was not the case if the Board found that the landlord had no right to such prevention. Moreover, having regard to Mr Tornefelt's opinion and its own inspection, the Board considered that the risk of damage caused by the installation was negligible. Nor could it not find any evidence that the installation would obstruct rescue workers' access to the flat. The only inconvenience for the landlord was the aesthetic aspect. However, the applicants' interest in being able to watch television programmes that were not accessible by other available means weighed more heavily, and the satellite installation could not therefore be considered as contrary to good sanitary conditions, order and good practice. 13. The landlord appealed to the Svea Court of Appeal (Svea hovrätt). The court held an oral hearing at which, inter alia, Mr Tornefelt gave evidence. It also made an inspection of the applicants' satellite installation. By a final decision of 20 December 2005, the court found that the applicants had disregarded their obligations as tenants, under the tenancy agreement and Chapter 12, section 25 of the Land Code, to such a degree that the agreement should not be extended, pursuant to Chapter 12, section 46, subsection 1(2) of the Code. They were given a respite until 31 March 2006 to move from the flat. The court found that the landlord had made a reasonable distinction between acceptable and unacceptable satellite installations and had submitted weighty reasons for prohibiting dishes mounted on the façade or otherwise extending outside of it. It noted that the evidence showed that the applicants' dish was virtually always positioned outside the kitchen window and thus constituted a permanent installation, and concluded, contrary to the findings of the Rent Review Board, that its placement breached Rule 13 of the tenancy agreement. In assessing the seriousness of this breach of contract, the court first concluded, with reference to Mr Tornefelt's testimony, that the satellite installation met the reasonable requirements of stability and safety. However, noting that the landlord's main reason for not allowing the installation was the safety aspect, the court considered that the landlord was entitled to make general risk assessments and should not have to determine whether an individual installation was unsafe or inconvenient. It went on to state that, while the applicants' interest in receiving the broadcasts of the television channels in question had to be taken into consideration and that it was desirable that technical solutions for such reception be found, the right to freedom of information relied on did not have such a bearing on the case that it could be considered to have any real importance. It noted, finally, that the applicants had been fully aware of the importance that the landlord attached to the issue of the placement of satellite dishes and of the consequences that could follow from a refusal to comply with the landlord's instructions in this respect. Although their satellite installation did not pose any real safety threat, their interests could not be allowed to override the weighty and reasonable interest of the landlord that order and good custom be upheld. 14. The landlord offered the applicants the option of staying in their flat if they agreed to remove the satellite dish. They did not agree to do this, however, and instead moved on 1 June 2006. They have stated that, largely because of the scarcity of flats for rent in the Stockholm area but also due to there being a court eviction order against them, they were forced to move to Västerås, approximately 110 km west of Stockholm. As a consequence, the first applicant now had much longer and costlier trips to and from work and the applicants' three children had had to change nursery and school and leave friends. 15. The renting of a flat is regulated primarily in Chapter 12 of the Land Code. 16. Section 2 provides that a tenancy agreement shall be in writing if the landlord or the tenant so request. In the event that a provision in the agreement is difficult to interpret, it is in practice ultimately interpreted to the disadvantage of the person who formulated the agreement. As it is almost always the landlord who draws up the tenancy agreement, the landlord has to take the responsibility for an agreement that is difficult to interpret. In most cases, landlords use standard agreements, the content of which is the result of negotiations between rental market organisations. 17. Section 3 contains provisions for the term and cancellation of tenancies. A tenancy agreement which is applicable for an indefinite period, as in the present case, must be cancelled for it to cease to apply. According to section 4, an indefinite tenancy agreement can be cancelled and thus cease to apply on the first day of the month following three months' notice. Section 8 provides that, in a case such as the present, a notice of cancellation shall be in writing and comply with certain rules governing service. 18. Section 23 provides, inter alia, that a tenant may not use the flat for a purpose other than that intended. Under section 24, the tenant is under an obligation to take good care of the flat. In general, he or she shall take care of it in a way that can be reasonably expected of an orderly person. Further, the tenant is liable to make good all damage caused by his or her carelessness or negligence. 19. Section 25 contains provisions on disturbances and demands on the tenant for keeping the flat sound, orderly and in good condition. Subsection 1 provides: “When using the flat, the tenant shall ensure that persons living in the vicinity are not subjected to disturbances which may be harmful to their health or otherwise impair their dwelling environment to an extent not reasonably tolerable ... . In his use of the flat, the tenant shall also in other respects do all that is necessary to keep the property sound, orderly and in good condition. ...” Disturbances and failure to meet those requirements may result in the tenancy agreement being forfeited under section 42. Special provisions and regulations can be included in the tenancy agreement. A tenant's refusal to abide by such provisions and regulations may also constitute a failure to fulfil the requirements for keeping the flat sound, orderly and in good condition. 20. It follows from section 46 that if the landlord has given notice of cancellation of the tenancy agreement, the tenant may still be entitled to have the agreement extended. However, subsection 1 of section 46 lists a number of situations in which the tenant loses the right to renewal. The first situation, laid down in subsection 1(1), is the forfeiture of the tenancy. Section 42 stipulates the conditions in which a tenancy agreement is deemed to be forfeited, including residential disturbances and failure to keep the flat sound, orderly and in good condition. The second situation, regulated in subsection 1(2), was relied on by the landlord and applied by the Court of Appeal in the present case. It concerns the tenant's neglect of their obligations. If the obligations are neglected to such an extent that it is not reasonable for the tenancy agreement to be extended, the tenant may lose the right to such renewal. The preparatory works to the latter provision state that the requirements of orderliness must be high in order to make it possible for the landlord to maintain the property in good order and condition (SOU 1961:47, pp. 84-85). The interests of the landlord shall be weighed against the reasonableness of the tenancy being terminated. Distressing personal circumstances may be taken into account. The possibility of another flat in the same area should also be considered (Government Bill 1968:91, Appendix A, p. 91). Examples of negligence are, for example, failure to pay rent, subletting without permission, refusing to grant the landlord access to the flat, depositing rent without valid reasons, residential disturbances, a failure to keep the flat sound, orderly and in good condition, and a breach of clauses in the tenancy agreement. 21. A large number of tenancy disputes are examined by the eight regional rent review boards, whose task it is, under section 4 of the Lease Review Boards and Rent Review Boards Act (Lagen om arrendenämnder och hyresnämnder, 1973:1988), to examine disputes concerning, for example, the terms of a tenancy and disputes relating to the renewal of a tenancy agreement. A decision by a Rent Review Board in a renewal dispute, as in the present case, can be appealed to the Svea Court of Appeal, in accordance with the Land Code, Chapter 12, section 70 in conjunction with section 49. No appeal lies against the court's decision, as provided for in section 10 of the Svea Court of Appeal Rent Cases Judicial Procedure Act (Lagen om rättegången i vissa hyresmål i Svea hovrätt, 1994:831). 22. Chapter 1, section 3, subsection 3 of the Constitutional Law on Freedom of Expression (Yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen) states the following: “Subject to any contrary provision of this Constitutional Law neither public authorities nor other public bodies shall prohibit or prevent the possession or employment of such technical aids as are necessary to receive radio programmes or to view or hear the content of technical recordings on grounds of the content of a radio programme or technical recording,.The same shall apply to any ban on the construction of landline networks for the transmission of radio programmes.” 23. Chapter 2, section 1, subsection 1 of the Instrument of Government (Regeringsformen) provides, inter alia, as follows: “Every citizen shall be guaranteed the following rights and freedoms in his relations with the public institutions: 1. freedom of expression: that is, the freedom to communicate information and express thoughts, opinions and sentiments, whether orally, pictorially, in writing, or in any other way; 2. freedom of information: that is, the freedom to procure and receive information and otherwise acquaint oneself with the utterances of others; ...” Section 12 provides that the enumerated rights and freedoms may be restricted only to satisfy a purpose acceptable in a democratic society. The restriction may never go beyond what is necessary having regard to the purpose which occasioned it, nor may it be carried so far as to constitute a threat to the free formation of opinion as one of the fundaments of democracy. Furthermore, no restriction may be imposed solely on grounds of a political, religious, cultural or other such opinion. Under section 13, freedom of expression and information can only be restricted on grounds of national security, national provision of supplies, public order and safety, the good name of an individual, the sanctity of private life, and the prevention and prosecution of crime. Freedom of expression may also be restricted in commercial activities. 24. The Constitutional Law on Freedom of Expression and the Instrument of Government apply to the relationship between individuals and public bodies. They do not apply to relationships between individuals.",['10'],[],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1976 and lives in Barcelona. 10. On 3 May 1997, the mother of A., a then ten-year old boy, filed a criminal complaint with the police alleging that on 1 May 1997 A. had been sexually assaulted by an unknown man at a playground. On the same day Mr Z., an officer of the Juvenile and Vice Police (jeugd- en zedenpolitie), took a statement from A., as well as from his mother. 11. On 11 May 1997, the mother of B., a then six-year old boy, informed the police that on 10 May 1997 an unknown man had sexually assaulted B. 12. On 12 May 1997, on the basis of descriptions given to the police by A. and B., the applicant was arrested in Amsterdam and detained on remand. 13. On 13 May 1997, A. was confronted with the applicant through a two-way mirror and identified him as the man who had assaulted him. According to the record of this confrontation drawn up by Mrs X., an officer of the Juvenile and Vice Police, A. had slightly recoiled when he saw the applicant, saying “That is him”. A. was also shown a rucksack, which he identified as belonging to the applicant. A. further declared that a woman from the neighbourhood had spoken with the man and that she had told him that the man spoke Spanish. 14. On the same day, Mrs E. – a maternal aunt of B. – gave a statement to the police in which she stated that on 10 May 1997, directly after having been told by her son W. that a man had touched the genitals of his cousin B., she had left her house in order to find this man, that she had found a man who matched the description given by her son and who was identified by B. and W. who had accompanied her, that he was sitting with some children and that this man had run away from her. One of these children, C., had told her that the man had stuck his hand into C.'s pants and that C. had then slapped the man's hand. When confronted with the applicant through a two-way mirror, she stated that she believed that he was the man whom she had seen on 10 May 1997. However, as he no longer had a beard and was looking neater and cleaner, she did not dare to say that she recognised him with 100%, rather with 80% certainty. 15. Also on 13 May 1997, B.'s mother filed a criminal complaint with the police against the unknown man who had sexually assaulted her son. On the same day, Mrs Y., an officer of the Juvenile and Vice Police, took a statement from B. When subsequently confronted with the applicant through a two-way mirror, he identified the applicant as the man who had sexually assaulted him. B. was further shown a rucksack, which he identified as belonging to the applicant. 16. On 13 May 1997, the mother of C., a then nine-year old boy, filed a criminal complaint with the police against an unknown man who had sexually assaulted her son on 10 May 1997. In his statement to the police officer Mrs Y., C. gave a description of the man. According to the record drawn up by Mrs Y., C. visibly reacted in fright when he was subsequently confronted with the applicant through a two-way mirror, identified him as the man who had sexually assaulted him and started crying. C. was further shown a rucksack, which he identified as belonging to the applicant. According to the police record drawn up on 14 May 1997, the description given by C. of the pants worn by the perpetrator corresponded to pants found in the applicant's possession. 17. A statement was also taken from C.'s mother, who declared that her son had told her on 10 May 1997 that a man had touched his private parts. 18. On 14 May 1997, the police took a statement of Mrs F. who was living on a houseboat near to a playground where, on 1 May 1997, she had seen, met and spoken with the applicant. When subsequently confronted with the applicant through a two-way mirror, she stated: “That is the boy with whom I have spoken. I am fully, 100 %, certain; no mistake is possible. I recognise the boy's face.” 19. On 22 May 1997, the mother of D., a then eleven-year old boy, filed a criminal complaint with the police against an unknown man who had sexually assaulted her son D. earlier that month. On the same day, the police took a statement from D. in which he described how a man had touched his private parts, that this man had stopped this when he had started to scream, that he had then gone to his mother and told her what had happened, that later on the same day he had seen this man again, and that an angry woman had then approached this man who then ran away. 20. On 2 June 1997, D. was confronted with the applicant through a two-way mirror. According to the record drawn up by Mrs Y., D. identified the applicant as the man who had sexually assaulted him. 21. The applicant was subsequently summoned to appear before the Amsterdam Regional Court (arrondissementsrechtbank) on 2 July 1997 in order to stand trial on charges of sexual assault and acts of indecency with persons younger than sixteen. 22. On 24 June 1997 the applicant's lawyer requested the public prosecutor to summon the four boys, Mrs E. and Mrs F. to appear before the Regional Court in order to be heard as witnesses, stating: “In his conversations with me, my client has repeatedly and with force indicated that he is innocent of the facts he has been charged with. Under these circumstances my client has the right and has an interest in being confronted in court with [these six] witnesses and to be given the opportunity to put (or have put) questions to them. My client and I have no objections to that hearing being held in camera.” The public prosecutor rejected this request by letter of 13 June 1997, considering that it would be particularly difficult, given their young age, to hear the four boys. Moreover, the defence had failed to indicate in any way – apart from a mere denial of the facts by the applicant – on what grounds it doubted the reliability of the confrontations which had taken place and the statements which had been given at the investigation phase. 23. At the hearing of 2 July 1997 before the Regional Court, the defence reiterated its request to hear the four boys, if appropriate in camera, as well as Mrs E. and Mrs F., stating: “My client denies wholeheartedly the charges against him. Therefore I wish to hear the victims [A., B., C. and D.] in court, as a mistake in identity is possible. It is very well possible that the four victims, under the stress that reigns at a police station, identified my client as the perpetrator because they have only been confronted with him. It is therefore in my client's interest to be confronted again [and] in court with the victims. ... Mrs F has only seen my client talking and has seen nothing punishable. Yet in the records she is presented as an important witness. I would therefore like to hear her, in particular about the impression my client made on her while he [roller]skated away. I finally wish to hear [Mrs E.] in court. Although she is an indirect witness, as she has no own knowledge of the perpetrator's physical features, she can contribute to exculpating my client. During the mirror-confrontation she has not recognised my client for the full hundred percent as the person she had seen.” 24. The prosecution opposed the request to hear the four boys, but not the request to hear the other two witnesses. 25. Having deliberated, the Regional Court rejected the request to hear the four victims, holding: “A one-to-one identification through a two-way mirror (enkelvoudige spiegelconfrontatie) has taken place at the police station, the value of which is now challenged by the defence. Now counsel asks for a new one-to-one confrontation (enkelvoudige confrontatie) in court between the victims and the accused. On this point, the court considers that such a confrontation between the witnesses and the accused cannot change or add anything to the confrontations that have taken place previously.” 26. The Regional Court granted the request of the defence to hear Mrs E. and Mrs F. In order to allow the prosecution to comply with a request from Interpol to provide the latter with a photograph of the applicant as well as his fingerprints so as to compare these with materials held by the Spanish police, the Regional Court adjourned its further examination of the case for a maximum period of three months. 27. The Regional Court resumed its examination on 20 August 1997. The applicant was present. The Regional Court noted that the following items had been added to the applicant's case file: photographs of the applicant taken by the Spanish police, a fax message dated 14 July 1997 from Interpol Madrid concerning pending preliminary judicial investigations against the applicant in Barcelona in respect of, inter alia, exhibitionism and the sexual provocation of minors, and a formal record dated 19 August 1997 of the forensic bureau of the Amsterdam-Amstelland police, according to which the applicant's fingerprints matched those taken from him by the police in Barcelona on 31 May 1995. 28. The applicant accepted that he was the man in the police photographs, and confirmed that the Spanish police had taken his fingerprints on 31 May 1995. He further confirmed that, on 12 December 1995 in Tarragona (Spain), he had been convicted for the sexual assault of minors and sentenced to six months' imprisonment. He further denied the facts with which he had been charged in the Netherlands. 29. Upon the request of the defence, the Regional Court then heard Mrs E. and Mrs F. Although both witnesses identified the applicant as the man they had seen at the material time, the applicant denied ever having seen the two women. 30. After having heard the parties' final pleadings, the Regional Court closed the trial proceedings and set a date for judgment. 31. In its judgment of 3 September 1997, the Regional Court convicted the applicant of sexual assault and of acts of indecency with persons younger than sixteen and sentenced him to twenty months' imprisonment. The applicant filed an appeal with the Amsterdam Court of Appeal (gerechtshof). 32. On 26 January 1998, a hearing was held before the Court of Appeal in the course of which the applicant made both oral and written submissions in which, inter alia, he denied the charges against him and challenged the reliability of his confrontation with the various witnesses and the credibility and reliability of the latter's statements. The Court of Appeal further took note of a request filed by the defence to refer the case back to the investigating judge (rechter-commissaris) in order to hear the four boys as witnesses and for an identification of the applicant by putting a selection of photographs of different persons to the witnesses (meervoudige / keuze-foto-confrontatie). In this connection, the lawyer acting for A. and his mother submitted that A. had been quite shocked by the events, that he no longer did certain things alone, asking to be accompanied, and that it was very difficult for him to come to terms with what had happened to him. 33. The applicant also submitted written pleadings prepared by himself in Spanish in which, inter alia, he challenged the reliability of his confrontation with the various witnesses and the latter's statements, and in which he stated that a second confrontation in the form of an identity parade would be pointless as the victims had already seen and identified him as the perpetrator in the course of a one-to-one identification through a two-way mirror. The President of the Court of Appeal ordered that this document be translated into Dutch and be added to the applicant's case-file. 34. After having heard the parties' pleadings, the Court of Appeal closed the trial proceedings, stated that it would determine the requests made by the defence in its judgment and set a date for judgment. 35. In its interim judgment of 9 February 1998, the Court of Appeal stated that it had appeared during its deliberations that its investigation was incomplete. It found it necessary, therefore, to take evidence from the police officers X., Y. and Z. in relation to the manner in which the victims had been questioned and confronted with the applicant. To this end, it fixed a hearing for 16 April 1998. It further ordered that the applicant was to be released from pre-trial detention on 10 February 1998. 36. On 16 April 1998, the Court of Appeal reopened the trial proceedings. The applicant, who had been released in the meantime, did not appear. His lawyer, who was present, informed the Court of Appeal that the applicant was being detained in Spain, and that he had instructed his lawyer by telephone to request the Court of Appeal to proceed with the trial proceedings in his absence. 37. The Court of Appeal heard the police officers X., Y. and Z. After having heard the parties' final submissions, the Court of Appeal closed the proceedings and set a date for judgment. 38. In its judgment of 27 April 1998, the Court of Appeal quashed the Regional Court's judgment of 3 September 1997, convicted the applicant of sexual assault and acts of indecency involving persons under sixteen years of age and sentenced him to fifteen months' imprisonment of which five months suspended pending a two years' probationary period, and less the time spent in pre-trial detention. It also ordered the applicant to pay A., who had joined the criminal proceedings as a civil injured party (benadeelde partij) and who had filed a claim for compensation, an amount of 500 Netherlands Guilders (“NLG”; i.e. 226.89 euros; “EUR”) for non-pecuniary damage. 39. It based the applicant's conviction on a statement he had made before the Court of Appeal, the criminal complaints filed containing a description of the perpetrator given by the four victims, the statements made by the four victims to the police, the record of the two police officers who arrested the applicant and considered that the applicant corresponded to the description of the perpetrator, the records on the mirror-confrontations between the applicant and the four victims, and the statements given by Mrs E. and by Mrs F. 40. As regards the evidence the Court of Appeal held, in so far as relevant, as follows: “2. ... during the hearing of 26 January 1998 ... the accused requested to be allowed, relying on [the Convention] to question the four minor children. 3. In its interim judgment of 9 February 1998, the court [of appeal] has lifted the pre-trial detention of the accused. It also reopened the trial proceedings, which had been closed on 26 January 1998, in order to hear the reporting police officers [X., Y. and Z.] on the manner in which the minor children had been questioned and the manner in which the confrontations had been conducted. These reporting police officers were heard as witnesses during the hearing of 16 April 1998. The accused did not appear at this hearing. His lawyer has indicated that he had had a contact by telephone with his client who was in Barcelona. [The applicant] had told [his lawyer] that he did not object to the further continuation of the trial proceedings in his case in his absence. 4. It follows from the above that the court, in its interim judgment of 9 February 1998, has not as yet granted the accused's request to hear the four minor children. The court heard the above-cited reporting police officers during the hearing of 16 April 1998 in order to obtain additional information about the manner in which the four children have been questioned and confronted with the accused. Also noting what has been stated by the reporting police officers [X., Y. and Z. at the hearing of 16 April 1998], the court considers that there is no necessity to hear the four children as witnesses. In so far as the request [to hear the four children] made by the defence is maintained – the applicant's lawyer having indicated at the hearing of 16 April 1998 that he did not wish to hear any further witnesses – the court rejects it. In balancing all interests involved, the court is of the opinion that the interests of the four still very young children in not being forced to relive a, for them, possibly very traumatic experience must be given priority over the interests of the suspect in hearing these children. 5. The court must now address the question whether the statements of the four children, having regard to the manner in which they have been questioned and confronted with the suspect, are sufficiently reliable to be used in evidence ... It must also be examined whether their statements may be used in evidence although the suspect has never been given the opportunity to question them. 6.1. In relation to the first question the court considers as follows: Although in general it is preferable for a witness to be given a choice between various options in a confrontation for identification purposes (meervoudige keuzeconfrontatie) instead of being confronted with only one person (enkelvoudige confrontatie), it cannot be said as a rule that the result of [the latter method] can only be used in evidence when it has appeared that the [former method] could not be used. There may be cause to exclude such a result when the manner in which a confrontation with only one person has taken place is incompatible with the fair conduct of proceedings or where the result finds insufficient support in other evidence. 6.2. Altogether six persons have been confronted with the suspect via a two-way mirror. Apart from the minor witnesses [A., B., C. and D.], adult witnesses [Mrs E. and Mrs F.] were involved here. A reading of the records of questioning and confrontation makes it clear that, in five of the six cases, a questioning in which the witness was asked to give a description of the suspect preceded the confrontation. ... Only in the case of Mrs E. this sequence was apparently different. In five of the six cases the most important procedural condition for obtaining reliable results in carrying out a confrontation has thus been complied with. In addition, it does not appear from the [police] records or from the reporting officers' oral evidence in court that these officers would have acted in a leading manner in the confrontations at issue. 6.3. The descriptions given by the six witnesses to the police show a high level of similarity. It transpires from the totality of the descriptions given that the person described was a young man, that he spoke another language than Dutch, had particular eyes, wore a cap and carried a (black-and-white) rucksack. The different witnesses each time mentioned three or more of these features ... In the [witnesses'] description of the suspect there are no points of contradiction. In the confrontation, five witnesses recognised the suspect on the basis of the features previously indicated by them. In their recognition of the suspect the witnesses demonstrated either as, in the case of Mrs E., little doubt, or a definite certainty. 6.4. On grounds of the above, the court does not doubt that the witnesses have wished to indicate the suspect as the person who has committed the facts [at issue] and that a mistake in identity cannot have arisen. The recognition by each separate witness each time finds support in the recognition by the five other witnesses. This entails that, from the point of view of reliability, the result of the confrontations carried out can be used in evidence. 6.5. Also noting the above the court finds no necessity to have an identification of the perpetrator by putting a selection of photographs of different persons to the witnesses (meervoudige fotoconfrontatie) carried out. The accused himself has – not incomprehensibly– indicated [during the appeal trial proceedings] that, after the mirror-confrontations already carried out, he did not consider this now useful anymore. In so far as the defence would maintain this request – the applicant's lawyer having indicated at the hearing of 19 April 1998 that he had no objection to the closure of the trial proceedings – the court rejects this request. 7.1. The remaining question is whether the statements of the four children can be used in evidence although the suspect has not had the opportunity to question them himself. The court's first consideration is the fact that Article 6 [of the Convention], particularly in the light of some recent [Strasbourg] decisions given on applications brought against the Netherlands, does not unconditionally oppose the use in evidence of statements given by witnesses whom a suspect has not been able to question. There is room for the balancing of interests. In its judgment of 26 March 1996 in the case of Doorson v. the Netherlands, the European Court [of Human Rights] considered in this respect that the principles of a fair trial also require that, in appropriate cases, the interests of the suspect in questioning [witnesses] are to be balanced against the interests of witnesses and victims in the adequate protection of their rights guaranteed by Article 8 [of the Convention]. In the opinion of the European Court, briefly summarised, in balancing these interests much weight must be given to the question whether the handicaps under which the defence labours on account of the inability to questioning a witness in an indirect manner are compensated, and whether a conviction is based either solely or to a decisive extent on the statement of this witness. In its report of 17 May 1995 [in the case of Finkensieper v. the Netherlands, no. 19525/92], the European Commission [of Human Rights] adopted an essentially similar opinion. 7.2. In the light of these decisions, the following can be said. As already found by the court, the interests of the four children in not being exposed to reliving a possibly traumatic experience weighs heavily. With that, as also already found by the court, stands the fact that the confrontations of these four witnesses with the suspect have been carried out with the required care, and that the results thereof, as already found earlier, are particularly reliable. As regards the acts themselves of which the suspect stands accused, the court finds it established that the four children have all been questioned by (or assisted by) investigation officers of the Amsterdam Juvenile and Vice Police Bureau with extensive experience in questioning very young persons. It has become plausible from the records drawn up by them and from the oral evidence given in court by these civil servants that the four children have been questioned in an open, careful and non-suggestive manner. What these children have stated, independently of each other, finds corroboration ... in what the other children have declared. In addition, important support for the veracity of their accounts is also to be found in the statements of the witnesses Mrs E. and Mrs F., witnesses whom the defence has been able to question at the hearing held before the Regional Court on 20 August 1997. It does not appear from the record of this hearing that their statements were challenged by the defence, only that the suspect did not recognise these witnesses. [The court further notes that] no request for their appearance in the proceedings on appeal has been made. Taking into account these circumstances as a whole, the court does not find a violation of the suspect's right to question witnesses in using as evidence ... the statements of the four children. 8. On the above grounds, the court is of the opinion – with the required cautiousness – that the statements of the children, as set out in the means of evidence, are reliable and credible and, furthermore, eligible to be used in evidence.” 41. On 4 May 1998, the applicant's lawyer filed an appeal in cassation, which is limited to points of law and procedural conformity, with the Supreme Court (Hoge Raad). 42. On 6 May 1999, the applicant's lawyer completed the applicant's appeal in cassation by submitting the grounds of the appeal, in which it was denied that the applicant had dropped his request to hear the four children. In this connection it was, inter alia, pointed out that, in its ruling of 27 April 1998, also the Court of Appeal had assumed that this request had not been withdrawn. 43. On 25 June 1999, the applicant's lawyer further submitted a response to the advisory opinion of the Advocate General to the Supreme Court who, in that opinion, did not address the question whether or not the applicant had withdrawn or maintained his request to hear the four children but who did find that the reason given by the Court of Appeal for rejecting the applicant's request to hear the four children was insufficient in that it had failed to establish or consider whether and why an adapted manner of questioning was not possible. In this respect, the Advocate General referred to the possibility to question the witnesses in the absence of the accused, the latter being in another room where he could follow the questioning on a television screen and, from there, have questions put to the witnesses. 44. In its judgment of 12 October 1999, the Supreme Court rejected the applicant's appeal, subject to the correction of a clerical oversight in the Court of Appeal's judgment of 27 April 1998. In so far as the applicant complained that the Court of Appeal had used in evidence the statements given by the four boys, although they had never been heard by a judge and/or in the presence of the defence, and despite a request thereto filed by the defence, the Supreme Court held that it was not necessarily contrary to Article 6 to use in evidence statements of such witnesses where such evidence was sufficiently supported by other evidence. Having regard to the manner in which the Court of Appeal had set out in its judgment, as regards each separate offence of which the applicant had been convicted, the evidence given by each of the boys and other pertinent evidence, the Supreme Court noted that the other evidence related each time to those parts of the boys' statements that were disputed by the applicant. The Supreme Court concluded that it was implicit in the Court of Appeal's findings that it had found the supporting evidence to be sufficient and that this finding, in itself not incomprehensible, could not be examined further in cassation proceedings. 45. The Supreme Court also rejected the applicant's argument that the Court of Appeal had unjustly found that it was not necessary to hear the four minors as witnesses. It did not deal with the question whether or not the applicant had withdrawn or maintained his request to hear the four children. As regards the reasons given by the Court of Appeal for not acceding to this request, the Supreme Court held: “In rejecting the request to hear the four minors as witnesses, the Court of Appeal ... has applied the correct standard. Nor is this decision [of the Court of Appeal] incomprehensible, since it follows logically from the establishment of the interest of the four still very young children in not being forced to relive a, for them, possibly very traumatic experience, that every confrontation with these experiences in pursuit of the criminal investigation, however organised, must be avoided.” 46. The finding that an accused has committed the act with which he or she is charged must be based on “legal means of evidence” (“wettige bewijsmiddelen”) within the meaning of Article 338 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Wetboek van Strafvordering; “CCP”). “Legal means of evidence” include, inter alia, the personal observations of the judge, the statements of the accused, the statements of witnesses relating to facts or circumstances which they themselves have witnessed, the formal minutes and records and other written documents (Article 339 § 1 and Article 344 §§ 1 and 2 of the CCP). 47. The public prosecutor has the power to call witnesses and experts to the trial court hearing (Article 260 § 2 of the CCP). In the summons to the accused the public prosecutor gives a list of the witnesses and experts to be brought forward by the prosecution. If the accused wishes to call witnesses, he or she can submit a request to the public prosecutor to summon a witness before the court. Such a request must be filed no later than three days before the court hearing (Article 263 § 2 of the CCP). 48. As a rule, the public prosecutor should summon the witness, but –according to Article 263 § 4 of the CCP as in force until 1 February 1998 – the public prosecutor could refuse to do so if it could be reasonably assumed that no prejudice to the rights of the defence would be caused if the witness was not heard in court. The public prosecutor had to give a reasoned decision in writing and at the same time inform the defence of its right under Article 280 § 3 of the CCP – as in force until 1 February 1998 – to renew the request to the trial court at the hearing. 49. If the public prosecutor had failed to summon a witness at the request of the accused, or declined to do so, the defence could, at the opening of the trial court proceedings, ask the court to have that witness summoned (Article 280 § 3 of the CCP). The trial court would accept such a request, unless it considered that the non-appearance of the witness could not reasonably be considered prejudicial to the rights of the defence (Article 280 § 4 of the CCP as in force until 1 February 1998). 50. A request by the defence to hear a witness who has not been placed on the list of witnesses, who has not been convened to attend the trial and whose summons the defence has not sought in accordance with (former) Article 280, fell under Article 315 of the CCP. Under this provision the trial court has the power to order, of its own accord, where it finds this to be necessary for the determination of the charges, the production of evidence, including the summoning of witnesses whom it has not yet heard. 51. If the trial court finds it necessary to have any factual question examined by the investigating judge, it must suspend the hearing and refer the question to the investigating judge along with the case file. The investigation carried out by the investigating judge in these cases is deemed to be a preliminary judicial investigation and is subject to the same rules (Article 316 of the CCP). 52. Appeal proceedings against the conviction or sentence at first instance involve a complete rehearing of the case. Both the prosecution and the defence may ask for witnesses already heard at first instance to be heard again; they may also produce new evidence and request the hearing of witnesses not heard at first instance (Article 414 of the CCP). The defence enjoys the same rights as it does at first instance (Article 415 of the CCP). 53. Although the provisions of the CCP, as in force until 1 February 1998, in respect of witnesses did not provide for a possibility to take account of their interests, it was accepted in the case law that a trial court, in its determination of a request by the defence to hear a witness, could take into account, to a certain extent, the latter's interests. In a judgment given on 9 February 1993, the Supreme Court accepted the reasons given by the Court of Appeal to refuse a request under Article 280 § 3 of the CCP by the defence to take (further) evidence from the victim of a sexual offence, a 22 year old woman with Down's syndrome. The Court of Appeal had considered that, given her mental condition and her clear distress in response to questioning, followed by an inability to provide any further answers to the investigating judge, it could not reasonably be expected of her to be exposed to the stress of a hearing. Moreover, the failure to take further evidence from her would not harm the accused in his defence to such a degree that – after having balanced the interests of the defence against those of the witness – the proceedings could not longer be considered as fair within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention. However, the Supreme Court did take into account the fact that the defence had been given an opportunity to provide the investigating judge with written questions and that these questions had in fact been put to the witness (Nederlandse Jurisprudentie (Netherlands Law Reports) 1993, no. 603). 54. On 1 February 1998, an amendment to a number of provisions of the CCP entered into force. According to the amended Article 264 § 1 (b) and (c) of the CCP, the public prosecutor may refuse the request of an accused to summon a witness in order to give evidence in court, where the prosecutor considers that there are well-founded reasons to believe that such oral testimony would entail a serious risk for the witness's health, or when the refusal of such a request, in all reasonableness, cannot be regarded as harming the accused's defence. On the same grounds, a trial court may decide not to hear a witness proposed by the defence (Article 288 § 1 (b) and (c) of the CCP). 55. Only in very rare cases are young children heard as witnesses before a court. In most cases, such witnesses are heard by an investigating judge. Witnesses younger than sixteen years of age – when heard before an investigating judge – are exempted from the obligation to testify under oath, but are urged to speak the whole truth and nothing but the truth (Article 216 § 2 of the CCP). 56. When a trial court uses such a statement in evidence, it should give special reasons in its judgment for doing so (Article 360 § 1 of the CCP). This requirement does, however, not apply where it concerns a statement of a child set out de auditu in a written record (proces-verbaal) drawn up by an officer with powers of investigation (opsporingsambtenaar) (Hoge Raad, 6 February 1990, Nederlandse Jurisprudentie 1990, no. 482). 57. On 1 January 2003, an amendment to Article 457 of the CCP, which provision governs the possibilities to obtain revision (herziening) of final judgments, entered into force. This amendment extended the existing grounds on which a revision of a final conviction can be sought by including as a ground for revision a ruling by the Court that the criminal proceedings having led to that conviction had been in violation of the Convention. The amended text of Article 457 of the CCP reads, in so far as relevant, as follows: “1. An application for revision of a final ruling (eindbeslissing) entailing a conviction which has obtained the force of res iudicata can be filed: ... 3o. on grounds of a ruling of the European Court of Human Rights in which has been established that [the Convention or one of its Protocols] has been violated in the proceedings having led to the conviction ... if revision is necessary with a view to reparation within the meaning of Article 41 of [the Convention].” A request for revision can be filed with the Supreme Court by the Procurator-General, the convicted person or the latter's lawyer within a period of three months after the convicted person has become aware of the Court's ruling referred to in Article 457 § 1 under 3 (Article 458 of the CCP).",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1979 and lives in Croatia. 6. The applicant took a job working on the boat E. On the night of 22 August 2007, whilst the boat was berthed in M. harbour, the applicant called the police, telling them that she had been raped by D.Š. in the boat’s lounge area. 7. A police officer soon arrived and found the applicant, D.Š., A.R. (the owner of the boat), and some other people on the boat. The applicant told him that she had been raped, while the others said that she had been disturbing public order. The police interviewed witnesses M.B., I.R. and A.R., and the suspect D.Š. 8. The relevant part of a police report drawn up by officer I.Z. indicates as follows: “Since D. was in a state of shock I could not conduct a detailed interview with her ... The waiter D.Š. said that it was true that he had put his fingers in D.’s private parts, but that he had not taken off her underwear ...” 9. The police drove the applicant and D.Š. in the same vehicle to the B. Police Station. At 6 a.m. on 23 August 2007 the applicant was taken to the S. Medical Centre, where she remained until 12.30 p.m. on the same day. She was seen by a gynaecologist, who established that she did not have injuries on her genitals but had a few lacerations on her body, without noting any further details. 10. On the same day the B. Police Station lodged a criminal complaint with the S. County State Attorney against D.Š. on the basis of the applicant’s allegations of rape. The State Attorney’s Office lodged a request with the S. County Court for an investigation in respect of D.Š. on the basis of the allegations of rape. D.Š. was arrested and brought before S.G, an investigating judge at the S. County Court. 11. Also on the same day, Judge S.G. heard evidence from D.Š., who denied raping the applicant. He explained that the applicant had become very drunk and he had taken her to her cabin on the boat. The judge then issued a decision expressing his disagreement with the request for an investigation. The relevant part of his decision reads: “... After the investigating judge had heard evidence from the suspect and consulted the case file, he established with certainty, on the basis of the documents enclosed with the criminal complaint, that before the event at issue the injured party had been in the company of several persons, including the suspect, in bar “F.” in M., where she had consumed a large quantity of alcohol, which was recorded by the breathalyser, and then they had all gone to the ship E. berthed in the close vicinity, on which the suspect, the injured party and other persons were employed and where the guests were asleep in their cabins. After arriving on the ship, and while still in the bar, the injured party had disturbed public peace and order, saying that she was drunk, that somebody had drugged her, and [asking] that the police be called. She said all this to a minor [child], I.R., ... but did not say that anyone had raped her or had committed any acts equal to sexual intercourse. Moreover, in her statement to the police I.R. stated that she had refused to call the police when she had seen that the injured party was drunk, and that the injured party had then slapped her in the face. After arriving on the ship, and this was confirmed by the statement of the ship owner, A.R., the injured party had shouted, entered the guests’ cabins and woken them up, to which A.R. had responded by asking her to stop shouting and disturbing the guests and she had then punched him in the stomach. After that, according to his statement, he had asked the captain of a ship berthed next to his to take D. off the ship, which they had done. The injured party had acted even more aggressively, shouting hysterically, especially when the owner of the ship, A.R., told her not to come back to his ship and that she had lost her employment. They had carried her away from the ship and made her sit on the seafront next to the ship until the police had come. All of the above was confirmed by M.B., the owner of the bar “F.”, but the injured party did not mention the word ‘rape’ or any other indecent act; she only said that somebody had made her drunk and drugged her, all of which transpires from the police report on page six of the case-file. Her allegations are confirmed by the statement [given to the police] by A.R., as well as other eyewitnesses. The injured party asked for the police to be called, saying that she had been drugged while in the bar. She asked the same of all the eyewitnesses, and repeated her request while she was on the ship and when she was physically thrown off the ship, but during all that time she never mentioned any criminal acts. The criminal complaint and the enclosures in the case-file show with certainty that the injured party was not, at any moment, alone with the suspect, nor did she mention to anyone after the alleged event that there had been any acts which could qualify as the criminal offence of rape. ... A medical report drawn up at the S. Hospital, enclosed with the criminal complaint, does not mention any injuries on the genitals of the injured party but only lacerations on her body which were obviously caused when she refused to leave the ship but was dragged and carried from it before the police arrived, when she sustained these injuries. In view of the statements given by the eyewitnesses, which were enclosed with the criminal complaint, the eyewitnesses all having been present throughout the events, the investigating judge is convinced that there was no reason for arresting D.Š., and after his questioning ... I have not established that there is a reasonable suspicion [on account of which] to open an investigation, ... and I do not agree with the request for opening an investigation ...” 12. The case file was then forwarded to a three-judge panel of the S. County Court, which on 24 August 2007 ordered an investigation in respect of D.Š. on the basis of the applicant’s allegations of rape. The investigation was conducted by Judge S.G. 13. A medical report drawn up by a doctor at the C. Hospital on 25 August 2007 records that the applicant had bruises on her genitals, a rash on the back of her upper legs and two smaller bruises on her buttocks. 14. A medical report drawn up by a doctor at the Rijeka Hospital on 30 August 2007 noted that the applicant was suffering from an acute reaction to stress. 15. On 30 August 2007 the applicant, on her own initiative, gave the skirt she had been wearing on the night in question to the police in C. as a piece of evidence. It was not given for forensic examination. 16. On 14 and 15 September 2007 the police interviewed M.V., I.R. T.Š., Ve.M. and F.B. Ve.M. said that M.V. had told him that she had found the applicant’s underwear on the boat and thrown it in the garbage. He further stated that D.Š. had commented that he would like to have sex with the applicant. F.B. also said that D.Š. had commented that he would like to have sex with the applicant. 17. At the request of the B. Police Station the applicant was interviewed at the C. Police Station, which was closer to her place of residence, on 19 September 2007. 18. On the same day the S. State Attorney’s Office asked that witnesses M.V., Z.B., T.Š., I.R., Ve.M. and F.B. be heard. They also asked for the forensic examination of possible biological traces on the clothes the applicant had been wearing during the critical event. 19. On 19 September 2007 the same Office asked that an examination of the applicant’s clothes be carried out in order to establish whether they had any traces of biological material on them. 20. On the same day Judge S.G. heard evidence from witnesses A.R., M.V. and M.B., and on 21 September 2007 from F.B. 21. On 2 October 2007 he heard evidence from the applicant. She said that D.Š. had raped her in the lounge of the boat where they had both been employed. She also said that the police officer who had arrived after her call had asked the men why they hadn’t thrown her into the sea. She alleged that her skirt had been torn and had had traces of blood on it, and she had told the officer that she had not being wearing any underwear because D.Š. had torn it and thrown it away in the boat’s lounge and told her that she had been drunk and not raped. The applicant had asked the officer to secure the evidence at the scene, such as her clothes, including her underwear, but he had replied that there was no need for that because she had been drunk and had not been raped. She had also heard the officer telling D.Š. not to worry and that “everything would be taken care of”. When the police had arrived D.Š. had already taken a shower. She also said that some time after the incident Ve.M., had telephoned her to tell her that her underwear had been found and that one of the boat’s employees, M.V., had thrown it in the garbage. She had telephoned the police to inform them about this but they had hung up on her. 22. On 28 November 2007 the applicant’s lawyer asked the S. County State Attorney’s Office to lodge a request for the withdrawal of Judge S.G. on account of his bias against the applicant. She received no reply. 23. On 3 December 2007 Judge S.G. heard evidence from Z.B., the gynaecologist who had seen the applicant on 23 August 2007, after the incident. He said that he had not noticed any injuries on the applicant’s genitals but that she had had few scratches elsewhere on her body, which he had not recorded because they did not fall into the gynaecological sphere. 24. On 5 December 2007 the S. County State Attorney’s Office asked Judge S.G. to ask for the results of all the forensic examinations of biological traces available in respect of the applicant, as well as those concerning her injuries, and to hear evidence from a further witness, Ve.M. 25. On 7 January 2008 Judge S.G. commissioned a psychiatric report on the applicant in order to establish her ability to correctly interpret events. He also ordered that the applicant’s previous psychiatric records be provided. The psychiatric report of 25 January 2008 relied on the applicant’s previous records concerning the period between 29 September and 26 October 2001 and a telephone conversation with the applicant, without having met her. 26. On 8 January 2008, at the request of the B. Police Station, officers at the M.L. Police Station interviewed the applicant’s father about the applicant’s relationship with her family. 27. On 19 February 2008 Judge S.G. received the forensic report on the biological traces, which did not establish any connection between the biological traces taken from the applicant and D.Š. The skirt the applicant had worn on the critical event was not examined. 28. On 29 February 2008 Judge S.G. obtained the forensic report concerning the applicant’s injuries, which established that the medical report concerning the applicant drawn up on 23 August 2008 by the gynaecologist at the S. Hospital had mentioned a few scratch marks on her body but no injuries on her genitals. The medical report drawn up on 25 August 2007 by a physician at the C. Hospital established that she had three scratch marks on her genitals, a rash on the back of her thighs and three haematomas. Judge S.G. concluded that the injuries established by the physician at the C. Hospital had been recorded two days after the alleged rape and had not been established by the gynaecologist who had seen the applicant on the morning after the alleged rape; they could not therefore be connected with certainty with the event. 29. On 10 March 2008 Judge S.G. commissioned a medical report on the injuries sustained by the applicant. On 11 March 2008 a medical report drawn up by an expert in forensic medicine established that the applicant’s injuries had first been recorded on 25 August 2007 by a doctor at the C. hospital, while the gynaecologist who had seen the applicant on 23 August 2007 had not recorded any injuries. Therefore, the doctor concluded that the injuries recorded on 25 August 2007 could not be directly connected with the event of 23 August 2007. 30. On 11 March 2008 Judge S.G. issued a decision expressing his disagreement with the request by the S. County State Attorney’s Office of 19 September 2007 to hear evidence from witness Ve.M. on the ground that he was not available since he had not answered the summons of the investigating judge to appear and the police could not find him. The S. County State Attorney’s Office lodged an appeal. On 20 March 2008 a three-judge panel of the S. County Court upheld the decision of the investigating judge on the ground that the information in the case file showed that witness Ve.M. had no direct knowledge of the criminal offence allegedly committed against the applicant. 31. The applicant alleges that the police interviewed her father about her relationship with her family. 32. On 31 March 2008 the S. County State Attorney’s Office ceased to pursue the criminal prosecution of D.Š. for lack of evidence. 33. On 9 April 2008 the investigating judge terminated the criminal proceedings against D.Š. 34. On 28 April 2008 the applicant took over the prosecution and lodged a bill of indictment against D.Š. in the S. County Court on charges of rape. On 9 September 2009 the bill of indictment was sent to D.Š. for reply. 35. On 17 January 2011 the S. County Court scheduled a hearing for 25 February 2011. On 15 February 2011 the lawyer representing the applicant informed the S. County Court that she was on maternity leave and was no longer able to represent the applicant in the proceedings at issue. She also informed the S. County Court that the applicant had instituted proceedings before the M.L. City Administration and was seeking legal aid. 36. On 24 February 2011 S. County Court scheduled a hearing for 14 April 2011, stating that it was expected that by that time a legal aid lawyer would have been allocated to the applicant. 37. On the same day the M.L. City Administration refused the applicant’s request for legal aid on the grounds that the purpose of legal aid was not to institute criminal proceedings and that the proceedings in question were not of essential importance for the applicant since she had not lodged a compensation claim in connection with them. This decision was upheld on 12 April 2011 by the Ministry of Justice and the applicant was instructed that she could institute proceedings in the Administrative Court within thirty days in order to challenge the administrative bodies’ decisions. She did not do so. 38. On 16 May 2011 the applicant informed S. County Court that she had not obtained legal aid and that, owing to lack of means, she could not continue the proceedings against D.Š. 39. On 27 May 2011 the S. County Court terminated the proceedings. 40. On 10 September 2007 the applicant lodged a complaint with the police by telephone, complaining about the police officers from the B. Police Station in connection with the event at issue. On 12 October 2007 the lawyer representing the applicant reiterated her complaint in writing. 41. On 5 November 2007 the Head of the B. Police Station instituted disciplinary proceedings against officers F.C. and I.Z. from the S.-D. Police Department. 42. On 9 November 2007 the Head of the S.-D. Police Department informed the lawyer representing the applicant about the disciplinary proceedings against the police officers. 43. On 21 December 2007 the First Instance Disciplinary Court of the S. Office of the Ministry of the Interior adopted a decision establishing the disciplinary responsibility of officers F.C. and I.Z. and fined them each ten per cent of one month’s salary. The relevant part of the decision reads as follows: “Police officer F.C. ... is responsible for failing to supervise and instruct officer I.Z., whom he had assigned to conduct the criminal enquiry in the case concerning the criminal offence of rape ... against D.J. ... by D.Š. ..., and for not informing the Head of the police station of the errors he had established when signing the criminal complaint (such as: the failure to carry out an in situ inspection and a detailed informative interview with the injured party, which resulted in a failure to draw up adequate reports; failure to collect clothes from the participants in the event at issue; and incomplete filling in of the required forms); also for not ordering the immediate rectification of the errors he had noted in the criminal complaint so as to order the conducting of a detailed interview with the injured party and the drawing up of adequate reports, and the seizure of her clothes and the clothes of the suspect ... by which he committed a grave breach of his official duty ... defined as ‘failure to act or untimely or reckless conduct or conduct lacking diligence in the carrying out of his official duties’ ... ... Police officer I.Z. ... is responsible for ... failures in his official conduct when he was assigned to carry out the criminal inquiry in connection with the criminal offence of rape against D.J., because he did not order an in situ inspection; nor did he take a statement from the injured party or conduct a detailed informative interview with her ... nor did he take the clothes that the injured party and the suspect were wearing in order to give them for forensic examination ... by which he committed a grave breach of his official duty defined as ‘failure to act or untimely or reckless conduct or conduct lacking diligence in the carrying out of his official duties’ ... ...” 44. The relevant articles of the Croatian Constitution (Ustav Republike Hrvatske) provide: “No one shall be subjected to any form of ill-treatment ...” “Respect for and legal protection of everyone’s private and family life, dignity, reputation and honour is guaranteed.” 45. Section 62(1) of the Constitutional Act on the Constitutional Court (Ustavni zakon o Ustavnom sudu, Official Gazette no. 29/2002) reads: “1. Everyone may lodge a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court if he or she deems that a decision (pojedinačni akt) of a State body, a body of local or regional self-government, or a legal person with public authority, which has decided on his or her rights and obligations, or on a suspicion or accusation in respect of a criminal act, has violated his or her human rights or fundamental freedoms, ... guaranteed by the Constitution (hereinafter: ‘constitutional right’) ...” 46. Article 188 of the Criminal Code (Official gazette nos. 110/1997, 27/1998, 50/2000, 129/2000, 51/2001, 111/2003, 190/2003, 105/2004, 84/2005, 71/2006) reads: “Whoever forces another person into sexual intercourse or another sexual act of equal nature by using force or threatening that he or she will directly attack her life or body or the life or body of a person close to her shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of three to ten years.” 47. The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Zakon o kaznenom postupku, Official Gazette nos. 110/1997, 27/1998, 58/1999, 112/1999, 58/2002 and 62/2003) provide as follows: “(1) Criminal proceedings shall be instituted and conducted at the request of a qualified prosecutor only. ... (2) In respect of criminal offences subject to public prosecution the qualified prosecutor shall be the State Attorney and in respect of criminal offences to be prosecuted privately the qualified prosecutor shall be a private prosecutor. (3) Unless otherwise provided by law, the State Attorney shall undertake a criminal prosecution where there is a reasonable suspicion that an identified person has committed a criminal offence subject to public prosecution and where there are no legal impediments to the prosecution of that person. (4) Where the State Attorney finds that there are no grounds to institute or conduct criminal proceedings, the injured party may take his place under the conditions prescribed by this Act as a subsidiary prosecutor.” Articles 47 to 61 of the Code of Criminal Procedure regulate the rights and duties of a private prosecutor and of an injured party acting as a subsidiary prosecutor. The Criminal Code distinguishes between these two roles. A private prosecutor (privatni tužitelj) is an injured party who brings a private prosecution in respect of criminal offences for which such prosecution is expressly prescribed by the Criminal Code (these are offences of a lesser degree). The injured party as a subsidiary prosecutor (oštećeni kao tužitelj) takes over criminal proceedings in respect of criminal offences subject to public prosecution where the relevant prosecuting authorities, for whatever reason, have decided not to prosecute. Pursuant to Article 55(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the State Attorney is under a duty to inform an injured party within eight days of a decision not to prosecute and of that party’s right to take over the proceedings, as well as to instruct that party on the steps to be taken in order to proceed with the prosecution. “... (2) Where the criminal proceedings are conducted upon a request by the injured party acting as a subsidiary prosecutor in respect of a criminal offence punishable by more than three years’ imprisonment, he or she may ask to have legal counsel appointed free of charge where this is in the interests of the proceedings and where the injured party lacks the means to bear the expenses of legal representation ...” “(1) A [criminal] complaint shall be lodged with the competent State Attorney[‘s Office] in writing or orally. ...” “(1) When the investigating judge receives a request for an investigation he or she shall examine the case-file and hear the person in respect of whom the investigation is requested, without delay ... If he or she agrees with the request he or she shall issue a decision on the opening of the investigation ... ...” “... (2) If the investigating judge does not agree with the request for the opening of an investigation, he or she shall ask a [three-judge] panel of the competent county court to decide upon it ... ...” 48. The relevant provisions of the Civil Obligations Act (Zakon o obveznim odnosima, Official Gazette nos. 35/2005 and 42/2008) read as follows: “(1) Every legal entity and every natural person has the right to respect for their personal integrity under the conditions prescribed by this Act. (2) The right to respect for one’s personal integrity within the meaning of this Act includes the right to life, physical and mental health, good reputation and honour, the right to be respected, and the right to respect for one’s name and the privacy of one’s personal and family life, freedom et alia. ...” “Damage is ... infringement of the right to respect for one’s personal dignity (non-pecuniary damage).” 49. The relevant part of section 186(a) of the Civil Procedure Act (Zakon o parničnom postupku, Official Gazette nos. 53/91, 91/92, 58/93, 112/99, 88/01 and 117/03) reads as follows: “A person intending to bring a civil suit against the Republic of Croatia shall first submit a request for a settlement to the competent State Attorney’s Office. ... Where the request has been refused or no decision has been taken within three months of its submission, the person concerned may file an action with the competent court. ...” 50. The relevant part of section 186(a) of the Civil Procedure Act (Zakon o parničnom postupku, Official Gazette nos. 53/91, 91/92, 58/93, 112/99, 88/01 and 117/03 reads as follows: “A person intending to bring a civil suit against the Republic of Croatia shall beforehand submit a request for a settlement to the competent State Attorney’s office. ... Where the request has been refused or no decision has been taken within three months of its submission, the person concerned may file an action with the competent court. ...” 51. Section 13 of the State Administration Act (Zakon o ustrojstvu državne uprave, Official Gazette nos. 75/1993, 48/1999, 15/2000 and 59/2001) reads as follows: “The Republic of Croatia shall compensate damage caused to a citizen, legal entity or other party by the unlawful or wrongful conduct of a State administrative body, or a body of local self-government or administration ...” 52. In decision no. U-III-1437/2007 of 23 April 2008 the Constitutional Court found that the conditions of detention of a prisoner, P.M., in Lepoglava State Prison amounted to inhuman treatment. It also addressed the question of P.M.’s claim for just satisfaction. The relevant parts of the decision read: “In particular, the Constitutional Court finds the [lower] courts’ opinion that in this case an award for non-pecuniary damage cannot be made under section 200 of the Civil Obligations Act on the ground that such compensation claim is unfounded in law, unacceptable. ... Section 1046 of the Civil Obligations Act defines non-pecuniary damage as infringement of the right to respect for one’s personal integrity. In other words, every infringement of the right to personal integrity amounts to non-pecuniary damage. Section 19(2) of the Civil Obligations Act defines the right to personal integrity for the purposes of that Act as: the right to life, physical and mental health, reputation, honour, dignity, name, privacy of personal and family life, freedom and other rights. ... it must be concluded that in this case there has been a violation of human, constitutional and personal rights because the applicant was placed in prison in conditions incompatible with the standards prescribed by the Enforcement of Prison Sentences Act, conditions also incompatible with the legal standards under Article 25(1) of the Constitution. For that reason the courts are obliged to award compensation for the infringement of the applicant’s dignity. ...”","['3', '8']",['8-1'],[],[],[],[],1

At the second round of the election, which took place on 5 March, the applicant was a member of one of the district election commissions. Following the election, the applicant participated in a series of rallies of protest organised in Yerevan by the opposition parties. 6. The applicant alleged, and the Government did not dispute, that at the beginning of April police officers of the Central District Police Station of Yerevan (ՀՀ ոստիկանության Երևան քաղաքի կենտրոնական բաժին) came to the applicant's home while he was absent. Having found out about this, the applicant went to the police station to inquire about the reasons for their visit. At the Police Station, the Deputy Head ordered the applicant to stop participating in the demonstrations. 7. On 7 April 2003 at 17h00 a demonstration was held in the centre of Yerevan on the occasion of Mother's Day. The demonstration took place on the Mashtots Avenue next to the Research Institute of Ancient Manuscripts (Մատենադարան). It appears that the demonstration was of a political nature and criticism of the Government and of the conduct of the presidential election was voiced. 8. The applicant alleged, and the Government did not dispute, that the demonstration was organised by women and was attended by about 30,000 people, the majority of whom were female. Traffic was suspended by the traffic police on the relevant stretch of the Avenue prior to the commencement of the demonstration. The applicant did not as such participate in the demonstration since most men, including himself, were observing it from a distance, standing on both sides of the Avenue. Their task was to encourage the women and to prevent possible provocations. 9. According to the applicant, at around 17h30 he went home. On his way home, about 100-150 metres away from the site of the demonstration, he was approached by two persons in civilian clothes, who showed police identity papers and took him to the Central District Police Station. 10. At the Police Station, the arresting police officers drew up a record of the applicant's arrest (արձանագրությաւն բերման ենթարկելու մասին) in which it was stated that the applicant had been “arrested at around 17h30 on the Mashtots Avenue for obstructing traffic and behaving in an anti-social way at a demonstration”. 11. One of the arresting police officers reported to the Head of the Police Station (ՀՀ ոստիկանության Երևան քաղաքի կենտրոնական բաժնի պետ) that: “... on 7 April 2003 we were on duty at the Mashtots Avenue, where a demonstration was being held and a great number of people were gathered. While on duty, we noticed one person who was obstructing traffic, behaving in an anti-social way and inciting others to follow his example. This person was brought to the Police Station...” 12. The applicant was subjected to a search during which no illegal items were found. A relevant record was drawn up. 13. The police officers questioned the applicant. The applicant made a written statement (արձանագրություն բացատրություն վերցնելու մասին) in which he submitted that he had participated in a demonstration three days before. Having found out about the demonstration of 7 April 2003, he had also gone there. He further submitted that he was aware of a demonstration to be held in two days and that he would participate in it. The applicant added that he had not violated, and would not violate, any laws during these demonstrations. This statement was torn up by the police officers, who said that there was a pencil mark and asked the applicant to write a new one. When he wrote the new statement with a similar content, the police officers stopped him at the point when he was about to write about not having committed any offences during the demonstrations and said that what he had written was enough. 14. The police officers drew up a record of an administrative offence (վարչական իրավախախտման արձանագրություն) in which it was stated that the applicant had “participated in a demonstration, during which he violated public order”. The applicant's actions were qualified under Article 172 of the Code of Administrative Offences (CAO) (Վարչական իրավախախտումների վերաբերյալ ՀՀ օրենսգիրք) as minor hooliganism. This record was signed by the applicant. He also put his signature in the section certifying that he was made aware of his rights under Article 267 of the CAO and in the section marked as “other information relevant for the determination of the case”, where he also added “I do not wish to have a lawyer”. 15. The applicant alleged that he had initially refused to sign this record and requested a lawyer. This became the reason why he was kept in the Police Station for the following five and a half hours. During this period, the police officers were persistently trying to convince him to sign the record and to refuse a lawyer. They told him that it was unnecessary to have a lawyer and spend money for such a minor case. They further said that the case had been already pre-decided by their superiors, so a lawyer would only harm rather than help, as he may end up spending quite some time in the Police Station because of that. On the other hand, if he signed the record and refused a lawyer, he would be immediately taken to a court, where at worst a small fine would be imposed and he would be released. The applicant finally succumbed and agreed to sign the record and to refuse a lawyer. The same day at 23h00 he was taken to judge M. of the Kentron and Nork-Marash District Court of Yerevan (Երևան քաղաքի Կենտրոն և Նորք-Մարաշ համայնքների առաջին ատյանի դատարան), who examined the case. 16. The Government contested this allegation. According to them, the applicant was kept at the Police Station for two hours and taken to judge M. at 19h30. During this period, the police officers explained to the applicant his right to have a lawyer and advised him to avail himself of this right, which he did not wish to do. The record of an administrative offence was signed by the applicant voluntarily and without any objections. Furthermore, the applicant failed to initiate any actions aimed at the defence of his rights, such as lodging motions or availing himself of other procedural rights guaranteed by Article 267 of the CAO, despite having been made aware of them. 17. The materials of the applicant's administrative case, which were transmitted by the police to judge M. for examination, contained the following documents: (1) the record of an administrative offence; (2) the police report; (3) the record of the applicant's arrest; (4) the record of the applicant's search; and (5) the applicant's written statement. All these documents were signed by the applicant except the police report. 18. Judge M., after a brief hearing, sentenced the applicant under Article 172 of the CAO to three days of administrative detention. The judge's entire finding amounted to the following sentence: “On 7 April 2003 at around 17h00 ... on the Mashtots Avenue [the applicant], together with a group of people, obstructed street traffic, violated public order by making a loud noise, and incited other participants of the demonstration to do the same...” 19. The decision stated that it was subject to review by the Chairman of the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal (ՀՀ քրեական և զինվորական գործերով վերաքննիչ դատարանի նախագահ). 20. According to the record of the court hearing – drawn up in a calligraphic handwriting – the hearing was held in public with the participation of the judge, a clerk and the applicant. The judge explained the applicant's rights to him and informed him of the possibility to challenge the judge and the clerk. The applicant did not wish to lodge any challenges. He stated that he was aware of his rights and did not wish to have a lawyer. The judge read out the motion submitted by the police, seeking to impose administrative liability on the applicant. The applicant stated that he, together with a group of unknown people, had blocked the traffic on the Mashtots Avenue. He said that he did this because it was a demonstration and everybody else was doing the same. He made noise since everybody else was making noise, but he did not push anybody. No questions were put to the applicant. Thereafter, the judge read out and examined the materials prepared by the police. Having familiarised himself with these materials, the applicant accepted that he had signed the record of an administrative offence but objected to being subjected to administrative liability since the incriminated acts had been committed also by others. The judge departed to the deliberation room, after which he returned and announced the decision. The time of the hearing was not recorded. 21. The applicant alleged, and the Government did not explicitly dispute, that the above record was a fake and was drafted at some point after the hearing in order to create an appearance of lawfulness. In reality there was no clerk and the hearing was not being recorded. The hearing lasted only about five minutes and was conducted in judge M.'s office. The applicant further alleged that, contrary to what the record stated, only the judge, the applicant and the accompanying police officer were present at the hearing. The latter did not as such participate in the hearing and his functions were limited only to bringing the applicant before the judge. petitioned the judge to summon some witnesses and requested a lawyer. The judge listened silently to the applicant, signed some papers and let the applicant go, after which he was taken to a detention centre where he served his sentence. 22. On 14 April 2003 the applicant applied to a local human rights NGO, “February 22nd” («Փետրվարի 22» իրավապաշտպան կազմակերպություն), complaining in detail about the above-mentioned events and seeking its assistance. He submitted, inter alia, that the police officers had prompted him to sign a document refusing a lawyer, persuading him that a lawyer was not necessary in his case. 23. On 28 April 2003 the NGO complained to the General Prosecutor (ՀՀ գլխավոր դատախազ) on behalf of the applicant, seeking to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers and judge M. 24. By a letter of 27 May 2003 the Kentron and Nork-Marash District Prosecutor (Կենտրոն և Նորք-Մարաշ համայնքների դատախազ) informed the NGO that the decision of 7 April 2003 had been well-founded and there were no grounds for lodging a protest. 25. The relevant provisions of the Constitution read as follows: “Everyone has the right to express his opinion. It is prohibited to force anyone to give up or change his opinion. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression, including the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any information medium regardless of frontiers.” “Citizens have the right to hold peaceful assemblies, rallies, processions and demonstrations without carrying arms.” “Everyone has the right to have his violated rights restored, as well as, in the determination of a charge against him, the right to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal with a respect for equality of arms.” “Everyone has the right to legal assistance. In cases prescribed by law legal assistance is provided free of charge. Everyone has the right to have a defence counsel from the moment of his arrest, detention or accusation.” “No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of the rights and freedoms guaranteed under Articles 23-27 of the Constitution other than such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in the interests of national security or public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights, freedoms, honour and reputation of others.” “The guarantor of independence of the judicial authorities is the President of [Armenia]. He presides over the Council of Justice.” “The independence of the courts is guaranteed by the Constitution and by law... The Council of Justice is composed of nine judges, elected in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law for a period of five years by secret ballot at the general meeting of judges of Armenia, and of four legal scholars, two of which are appointed by the President of [Armenia] and the other two by the National Assembly. The meetings of the Council of Justice are presided over by the President of the Court of Cassation who does not have the right to vote.”] “The Council of Justice ..., upon the proposal of the Minister of Justice, shall prepare and submit for the President's approval the annual lists of professional fitness and career development of judges on the basis of which appointments are made...” “A judge [is] irremovable. He shall stay in his post until the age of 65.” “In administering justice, a judge ... [is] independent and obey[s] only the law.” 26. The relevant provisions of the Code, as in force at the material time, read as follows: “A person shall be liable to an administrative penalty for offences envisaged by this Code, if these offences by their nature do not attract a criminal penalty in accordance with the law.” “An administrative penalty is a form of liability which is imposed in order to educate the person, who has committed an administrative offence, to uphold the Soviet laws and to respect the rules of socialist way of life, as well as to deter the offender and others from committing new offences.” “The following administrative penalties may be [inter alia] imposed for committing an administrative offence: ... (2) a fine; ... (6) correctional labour; (7) administrative detention.” “Administrative detention is prescribed and imposed only in exceptional cases for certain types of administrative offences for a period not exceeding fifteen days. Administrative detention is imposed by a court (a judge).” “Minor hooliganism, i.e. obscene swearing at a person or an offensive annoyance of a person in a public place and other similar actions which disturb public order and peace of citizens, leads to an imposition of a fine insufficient, of administrative detention not exceeding 15 days.” “Judges of first instance courts examine cases concerning administrative offences envisaged by ... [inter alia] Article 172 ... of this Code.” “Cases on administrative offences are examined in public.” “The public prosecutor, who ... monitors the enforcement of laws in the context of proceedings on administrative cases, is entitled to institute the administrative proceedings; to familiarise himself with the materials of the case; to scrutinise the lawfulness of actions of the authorities (public officials) in the course of the administrative proceedings; to participate in the examination of the case; to lodge motions and make conclusions in respect of questions arising during the examination of the case...” “Any facts, on the basis of which the authorities (public officials) establish the existence or absence of an administrative offence and the guilt of a particular person, as well as other circumstances decisive for the proper outcome of the case, constitute evidence in an administrative case. Such facts are established by the record of an administrative offence, the statement of the person against whom administrative proceedings are brought, testimonies of the victim and witnesses, expert opinions, exhibits, the record of seizure of objects and documents, as well as by other documents.” “The record of an administrative offence shall be drawn up by an authorised official...” “The record of an administrative offence shall contain: the date and the location when and where it was drafted; the post and name of the person drafting it; information concerning the offender; the location, time and essence of the administrative offence; the legal act prescribing a penalty for the offence committed; names and addresses of witnesses and victims, if any; the explanation of the offender; other information necessary for the determination of the case. The record shall be signed by the person drafting it and the offender... If the offender refuses to sign the record, a relevant entry is made in the record. The offender is entitled to make explanations and comments concerning the content of the record, which are to be attached to it, and also to indicate the reasons for refusing to sign it. When drafting the record, the offender must be made aware of his rights and obligations under Article 267 of this Code and a relevant entry must be made in the record.” “The record [of an administrative offence] shall be transmitted to the authority (public official) authorised to examine the administrative case.” “... in order to prevent administrative offences, if other measures of compulsion have been exhausted, and to ensure the timely and accurate examination of cases and the enforcement of decisions in cases on administrative offences, a person may be subjected to an administrative arrest, search, inspection of belongings and confiscation of belongings and documents, for the purpose of verifying his identity and drawing up a record of an administrative offence, if this record cannot be drawn up on the spot and if such a record is required to be drawn up.” “An administrative arrest must be recorded[. The record] must indicate the date and place, the post and the name of the person drawing up the record; information about the arrestee; the time, place and grounds of the arrest.” “Only authorities (officials) authorised by the laws of the USSR and Armenia can impose an administrative arrest on a person who has committed an administrative offence[. These include, inter alia,] the internal affairs authorities in cases of minor hooliganism...” “The person against whom administrative proceedings are brought has the right to familiarise himself with the materials of the case, to make statements, to submit evidence, to lodge motions, and to have legal assistance during the examination of the case.” “Any person, who may be aware of any circumstance connected to the case which needs to be clarified, may be called as a witness in an administrative case.” “Cases concerning administrative offences envisaged under ... [inter alia] Article 172 ... of this Code shall be examined within one day...” “At the hearing, [the examining authority] announces the case that is to be examined and the person against whom administrative proceedings are brought, explains to the persons participating in the case their rights and obligations, and reads out the record of an administrative offence. [The examining authority] hears the persons participating in the case, examines the evidence and rules on motions. If a public prosecutor participates in the case, [the examining authority] hears his opinion.” “In examining the administrative case, the authority (public official) must clarify whether an administrative offence has been committed; whether the person in question is guilty of committing it; whether an administrative penalty should be imposed; whether there are mitigating and aggravating circumstances; whether pecuniary damage has been caused...” “The court's (the judge's) decision to impose an administrative penalty is final and not subject to appeal in administrative proceedings, except for the cases prescribed by law.” “The prosecutor can lodge a protest against the decision taken on an administrative case.” “The judge's decision to impose an administrative penalty for an offence envisaged under ... [inter alia] Article 172 ... can be quashed or modified by the judge himself upon a protest of the prosecutor and, whether or not such a protest is lodged, by the chairman of the superior court.” “In administering justice, a judge is independent and obeys only the law. In administering justice, a judge is not accountable to any public authority or a public official.” “Any interference by public authorities, bodies of local self-government and their officials, political parties, non-governmental associations and media with a judge's performance of his functions of administering justice is impermissible and leads to accountability prescribed by law. A judge is not obliged to give explanations concerning a case or the substance of materials under his consideration or to grant access to them other than in cases and according to a procedure prescribed by law.” 27. Chapter 9 of these Regulations prescribes the rules for organising and holding the proficiency test on the basis of which the annual lists of professional fitness and career development of judges are prepared by the Ministry of Justice. 28. On 16 April 2003 the Constitutional Court adopted a decision on the basis of an application lodged by the main opposition candidate in the presidential election challenging the conduct and results of the election (ՀՀ սահմանադրական դատարանի որոշումը ՀՀ նախագահի 2003 թ. մարտի 5-ի ընտրության արդյունքները վիճարկելու վերաբերյալ գործով). The Constitutional Court noted, inter alia, that a number of authorised election assistants had been subjected to administrative detention in the second round of the election and had thus been deprived of the possibility of actively pursuing their duties any further. The Court further stated that subjecting to administrative detention for having participated in unauthorised demonstrations and marches constituted an interference with the right to freedom of peaceful assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention. First of all, such application of this procedure was in contradiction with European “rule of law” standards, and secondly, all such decisions made by the courts were to be a topic for discussion in the Council of Court Chairmen and the Council of Justice in terms of both their form and substance. 29. The relevant extract from the Resolution provides: “9. The Assembly further invites the authorities to revise the Administrative Code without delay. It urges them to abolish the provisions concerning the administrative detention and to refrain from applying them in the interim. It warns the authorities of the abuses their application leads to, which are seriously at variance with the principles of the Organisation.” 30. The relevant extracts from the Report provide: “32. The day after the first round of the presidential election held on 9 February 2003, several demonstrations and protest meetings took place in Yerevan and several towns at the prompting of opposition political parties. 33. Between the two rounds of the elections, and as from 22 February, more than 200 people were arrested by the police at the behest of the authorities – among them some members of the political parties in opposition or of their campaign staff, and agents of these parties. Despite the Parliamentary Assembly's stipulation that the authorities must no longer avail themselves of the arbitrary procedure of administrative detention prescribed by the Administrative Code, these persons were arrested, taken into custody without notification of their families then brought before the courts and sentenced to a fortnight's administrative internment in over 80 cases, or to fines in 65 other cases. The persons concerned were tried in camera and with few exceptions did not receive the assistance of a lawyer. Many were unable to participate in the second round of the election. 34. Further arrests were made after the second round of the election. The Ministry of Justice has acknowledged that 132 people were arrested between 17 and 25 March, 69 of them being sentenced to an “administrative” custodial penalty and 63 to a fine. According to the OSCE, 77 is the number sentenced to a term of imprisonment over that period. 35. In our previous report we commented on the outrageousness and arbitrariness of this summary procedure prescribed by the Administrative Code. An authentic remnant of the Communist style of justice inherited from the Soviet era, this procedure denies the person charged the right to inform his/her family or to request the immediate assistance of a lawyer, and enables a judge, under an arrangement for immediate trial in camera, to have him/her held for a fortnight maximum. This procedure is simply disgraceful... 37. During our August 2003 visit, the authorities justified their decision to arrest and convict these demonstrators by invoking the need to shield law and order from their misdeeds. They claim that the demonstrators were just thugs, “antisocial elements”, alcoholics or drug addicts. This sort of talk has a ring to it that is like a revival of the evidently not so distant Soviet past. 38. We expect the authorities to do their utmost in the future to reconcile the freedom to demonstrate and the freedom to come and go with respect for law and order. This right must be secured to all and sundry, especially at election time. Preservation of law and order must not serve to condone wrongful deprivation or restriction of freedom to form assemblies and to demonstrate.” 31. The relevant extracts from the Resolution provide: “14. The Assembly is shocked by the scandalous use that continues to be made of the arbitrary procedures concerning administrative detention provided for in the Administrative Code, which is totally incompatible with its strongly-worded statement in Resolution 1304 of September 2002 that the Armenian authorities should no longer make use of these procedures. It firmly condemns the arrest and conviction of over 270 people – members of the opposition parties, sympathisers and office-holders – between the two rounds of the presidential election and at the end of the second round. It expects the Armenian authorities to discuss by February 2004 the issue of administrative detention provided for in the Administrative Code in co-operation with Council of Europe experts and to send the draft amendments for the Council of Europe's expertise by April 2004. 15. The Assembly asks the Armenian authorities to immediately begin examining, in co-operation with the Council of Europe, the question of the balance to be struck between freedom of assembly and demonstration and respect for public order, and to adopt a law on demonstrations and public meetings in full compliance with Council of Europe principles and standards.” 32. The relevant extracts of the Briefing Paper provide: “The opposition demonstrations of February to April 2003 In the period between the [19 February 2003] round and [5 March 2003] runoff of the presidential election, the [main opposition candidate] campaign staged several rallies in the center of Yerevan, each of which attracted tens of thousands of supporters... After the [5 March 2003] runoff the [main opposition candidate] campaign continued to stage rallies in the center of Yerevan at intervals of several days or a week, to protest alleged election fraud... Rendering opposition rallies illegal Although ... rallies and protest demonstrations [in support of the main opposition candidate] were largely peaceful, the governing authorities portrayed them as a threat to public order and political stability, and used this as grounds for arrests... The campaign of arrests [21-27 February 2003]: the first wave of arrests In a first wave of arrests, roughly 160 chiefs and staff of regional and district [main opposition candidate] campaign headquarters, [authorised election assistants], and even drivers were taken to their local police stations... Dozens of activists were arrested at their homes in different regions of the country the morning after police supposedly picked them out, among several tens of thousands, at an 'unauthorised' rally in Yerevan in the late afternoon of [21 February 2003]. When police officers took opposition activists from their homes it was invariably on the pretext that the local police chief wanted to talk to them. Some activists accompanied the officers willingly, and some initially refused, but met threats in response... In some cases where the police did not initially find the activist at home, they resorted to violent or extra-legal tactics. There were instances of the police taking family members as hostages, to compel activists to give themselves up... [1-17 March 2003]: conditional releases, continuing pressure Following international pressure ... about seventy-five of the eighty-six men serving election rally-related administrative detention sentences were released during the weekend of [1-2 March]... [18-22 March 2003]: the second wave of arrests During this five-day period, as post-election protest rallies continued, the police arrested approximately ninety ... activists [supporting the main opposition candidate] in Yerevan, Abovian, Artashat district, Talin, and other areas. Most were taken from their homes – some for the second time. Dozens received administrative detention sentences. [7-9 April 2003]: around the presidential inauguration Several men and women were arrested after [a 7 April 2003] demonstration in central Yerevan, and given administrative fines or terms of detention... Due process violations in administrative offences proceedings Incommunicado preliminary detention On bringing opposition activists to the police station, officers kept them in incommunicado detention, depriving them of counsel. This allowed police wide scope to pressure the activists to admit guilt. In many cases, the police refused to inform or acknowledge to relatives and lawyers of people who had gone missing that they were in police custody. A lawyer who took on the cases of more than thirty activists taken in the first wave of arrests said that simply finding the people he had been tasked to represent was his primary task, and providing legal assistance came a distant second. The wife of an activist arrested in Armavir said: 'For five days they gave no information. We did not know whether he was alive or dead.' When lawyers, relatives, or human rights groups tried to find detainees in custody, police did not cooperate. Lawyer [T. T.-Y.] said: 'When we go to police departments, we are told the detainee is in court. When we go to the court, they say he or she is in one of the police departments. Before the confusion is resolved, a court verdict for fifteen days of administrative detention has already been issued.' In Armenia, there is no system of obligatory, transparent registration of all detainees at police stations. [T.-Y.] noted: 'Wherever we went, they said, 'No, he's not here.' The lack of any documentation of detentions makes it difficult for us to dispute. They can claim afterward that the detainee was not there at the exact time we came and asked.' In two cases Human Rights Watch documented, police pretended detainees were not at a particular police station when they patently were. The police kept detainees for as long as they considered necessary, with little apparent reference to procedural rights guarantees... Since most were brought in on the pretext of 'a chat' with the police chief, the legal basis of their detention was not immediately clear – whether or not they were arrested, and if so, whether under the administrative or criminal code. With some detained activists the police were initially at a loss as to what to charge them with. With others, the police manipulated the ambiguity, threatening both criminal and administrative charges. At Echmiadzin police station, officers threatened to press criminal charges against [one defendant] if he refused to confess that he resisted and swore at the policemen who had just taken him from his home. He recalled: 'I signed on the strength of their promise that I would only get two days of administrative detention.' From mid-March onward, the police extracted either written confessions or undertakings to take no further part in rallies from a number of activists by threatening to beat them. [One defendant], detained at the Yerevan City Police Department, stated that her three interrogators pointed out the lockup in the courtyard, said it was full of women, and that they would all be truncheoned that night: 'Then they showed me black spots on the carpet and said it was blood. Through this kind of pressure they forced me to write that I took part in a rally and obstructed traffic.' In several cases, police did use violence: [one defendant] alleged she was hit on the head with a plastic bottle of water; [another defendant] recounted being hit with a pistol butt, then punched and kicked. Flawed court hearings In almost all cases, administrative court hearings against opposition activists were closed and cursory. Courts considered only police evidence, and did not give the defendant the opportunity to summon defence counsel or defence witnesses. Several factors indicate that the judges acted under the influence of political authorities. In many cases, judges issued the harshest administrative sentence possible – fifteen days detention – to opposition activists. Some judges at [the Kentron and Nork-Marash District of Yerevan] were frank with defendants about their one-sentence-fits-all-policy. A judge told [one defendant]: 'Those who took part in the rally – we are giving them all fifteen days.' When [another defendant] asked a judge to consider handing him a shorter sentence, the latter replied that: 'his instructions were to put us all away for fifteen days – no less.' Judges' questioning of several defendants was blatantly political, such as: 'Why do you play at opposition?' and, 'Why do you bad-mouth the government?' They warned some not to participate in opposition rallies again. The police appeared to exercise control over the courts when they were in administrative session. During the week of [22-28 February 2003], when [the Kentron and Nork-Marash District Court of Yerevan] tried nearly one hundred [main opposition candidate] supporters, 'Red Berets' – police commandos – sealed off the building to the public. The chairman of the court acknowledged that their deployment was an initiative of the police leadership on which the court was not consulted... Some defendants demanded lawyers, but court officials and police told them that they were either 'not necessary' or 'not allowed' in administrative cases. Although he had a contract with [a defendant], lawyer [N.B.] was barred from entering [on 22 February 2003 the Kentron and Nork-Marash District Court of Yerevan] to defend him. In the absence of public scrutiny or defence counsel, judges applied sloppy or arbitrary reasoning in their examination of cases, or none whatsoever. In most cases, hearings lasted from a few seconds to a few minutes, and the written judgments were pre-prepared. The judge started [one defendant's] hearing by reading out his sentence – fifteen days detention for having participated in an unauthorised march. When [the defendant] objected that he had not participated in the march, he related, 'The judge just said, 'It is proven' and called a policeman to take me away.' While some judges alluded to the existence of proof without feeling it necessary to present it, others floated hypotheses, such as: 'You took part in an unauthorised rally, and you committed acts of hooliganism on Mashtots Avenue. You shouted or broke something, is that right?' In other hearings, judges did not advance any arguments. Two [opposition] party activists from the Shengavit district of Yerevan were each given three days' detention without learning what they were charged with, while a judge quelled [another defendant's] objection to the absence of stated information or grounds for his fifteen-day sentence with the comment: 'Just say thank you that we didn't press a criminal charge.' The lack of outside scrutiny also enabled several cases of demonstrably gross arbitrariness by the courts. On [22 February] 2003 the Kentron and Nork-Marash District Court of Yerevan] handed out some administrative detention sentences without conducting hearings in the presence of defendants. At least one police van with several detained activists inside was seen to drive up to the court, where a court official emerged and reportedly handed prepared judgments to the escorting police officers. The van then drove away without the defendants having set foot in court...”","['11', '6']","['6-1', '6-3']",['6-3-b'],['6'],"['6-1', '6-3']",['6-3-c'],1

On 10 June 2003 the first applicant and her sons, Ali and Umar Zabiyev, were working in a field outside the village of Galashki. At some point they noticed a helicopter flying in circles above them. 9. At about 7 p.m. they rode home in a ZIL-130 lorry; Umar Zabiyev was driving. When they were within 4 kilometres of the village of Galashki, their vehicle came under heavy gunfire. Apparently the shots were fired from machine guns and came from the nearby forest. The first applicant was wounded in the back, neck and head. Umar Zabiyev lost control of the lorry, which crashed into a roadside tree. The Zabiyev brothers took the first applicant, unconscious, out of the vehicle. Then Ali Zabiyev ran to the village for help; Umar Zabiyev stayed with his mother. At some point the lorry exploded. Then the gunfire ceased. 10. About forty minutes later Ali Zabiyev, accompanied by Musa Zabiyev, policemen and fellow villagers, arrived at the scene of the incident to find the first applicant lying on the ground and no trace of Umar Zabiyev. The first applicant was then transported to hospital; two bullets were extracted from her body. 11. Having heard about Umar Zabiyev's disappearance, the villagers started searching for him. At about 10 p.m. on 10 June 2003 two of them, Mr D. and Mr O., met in a forest a group of around thirty or forty armed men speaking unaccented Russian. The armed men forced the two villagers to the ground and questioned them. Then they contacted someone via a portable radio transmitter, ordered the villagers to lie still for another half an hour and left. 12. In the morning of 11 June 2003 a group of Russian servicemen, under the command of an officer with the rank of major-general, arrived at the scene of the incident. The major-general suggested that the Zabiyevs had been attacked by unknown Chechen insurgents and denied any possible involvement of Russian military personnel. 13. At 12 noon on 11 June 2003 Umar Zabiyev's dead body, with gunshot wounds and bruises, was found around two kilometres from the scene of the incident and some twenty metres from the place where Mr D. and Mr O. had met the armed men the night before. The corpse was partly covered with soil. 14. At about 7.10 p.m. on 10 June 2003 unidentified persons were hiding in the forest on the left side of the road leading from the village of Dattykh at a distance of 4 kilometres from the village of Galashki. They fired from machine guns at the ZIL-130 lorry in which the first applicant, Umar Zabiyev and Ali Zabiyev were travelling. As a result of the shooting the first applicant suffered injuries to her neck and back, Ali Zabiyev received tangential soft-tissue wounds and Umar Zabiyev went missing. 15. On 11 June 2003 the dead body of Umar Zabiyev was found buried at a distance of 1.7 kilometres from the scene of the incident. The body bore traces of numerous gunshot wounds to the head and body. 16. On 16 July 2003 Human Rights Watch released a paper entitled “Russia: Abuses Spread Beyond Chechnya. Neighboring Ingushetia Now Affected”, which described the Zabiyevs' case as follows: “On June 10, three Ingush civilians – sixty-five-year-old Tamara Zabieva and two of her sons, Ali and Umar Zabiev – were returning from their potato field near the village of Galashki, when their truck came under heavy machinegun fire, injuring Zabieva in the back, neck, and head. The brothers took their mother out of the car and Umar stayed with her while Ali ran to the village for help. Local Ingush police who arrived about an hour later found Zabieva unconscious and sent her to the local hospital, but were unable to find Umar. His body, bearing clear marks of torture and gun shot wounds, was discovered the next morning in a nearby forest. The Ingush police said that evidence suggests involvement by federal servicemen, but the military procuracy has refused to take over the case. While Galashki has in the past been the scene of clashes between Russian federal forces and Chechen rebel fighters, Human Rights Watch has no indication that any such activity took place in the area that day.” 17. Later, Human Rights Watch gave a more detailed description of the Zabiyevs' case in its article entitled “Spreading Despair: Russian Abuses in Ingushetia”, issued in September 2003. 18. In the afternoon of 11 June 2003 investigators examined the scene of the incident. They found many used cartridges and an empty machine-gun cartridge belt, used bandages, empty water bottles, canned pork and plastic bags bearing the Russian Ministry of Defence logo. The investigators took fingerprints from the bottles and tins. Then Umar Zabiyev's dead body was transported to the morgue. 19. At 5.20 p.m. on 11 June 2003 a forensic expert commenced a post-mortem examination of Umar Zabiyev's body. According to the forensic report, there were numerous gunshot wounds to the body, namely three perforating wounds to the head; one penetrating, two perforating and two non-penetrating wounds to the chest; three perforating wounds to an arm; a wound to a shoulder joint and a wound to a buttock. It was also established that Umar Zabiyev's lower jaw had been broken by a blunt hard item. The expert concluded that Umar Zabiyev's death had been caused by the penetrating and perforating wounds to the head and chest and that the lethal shots had been fired from machine guns aimed at Umar Zabiyev while he had been either standing or lying down. The death had occurred some eighteen to twenty-four hours before the beginning of the autopsy. 20. On 12 June 2003 Umar Zabiyev was buried. His family received 100,000 Russian roubles (RUB) from the President of Ingushetia as a burial allowance, which was a common practice at the material time. 21. On an unspecified date the head of the local administration confirmed in writing that there had been no armed clashes between the federal troops and rebel fighters in the area around the village of Galashki between 9 and 11 July 2003. 22. On 25 June 2003 Musa Zabiyev wrote to the Prosecutor General of Russia, the Prosecutor of Ingushetia and the military prosecutor of the United Group Alignment (UGA), complaining about the military attack on his relatives and the murder of his brother. 23. On 14 July 2003 the prosecutor's office of the Sunzhenskiy District of the Republic of Ingushetia (“the district prosecutor's office”) informed Musa Zabiyev that his complaint concerning the events of 10 June 2003 would be examined within the course of the investigation in case no. 23600032. 24. On 17 April 2004 the Ministry of the Interior of Ingushetia informed the second applicant that the investigation into the murder of Umar Zabiyev in case no. 03600032 had been commenced by the district prosecutor's office. It noted, in particular, the following: “As a result of the investigative measures taken it was established that the crime had been committed by the servicemen of military intelligence unit no. 194 KTG («разведрота 194 КТГ») with the direct involvement of the head of that unit, [S.P.], nicknamed 'the Snake' («Змей»), who is unable to leave the location of the unit in the village of Dattykh in the Sunzhenskiy District of Ingushetia as the military prosecutor's office has charged him with another crime and instituted criminal proceedings on that account.” 25. On 7 July 2006 a member of the Parliament of Ingushetia received a letter from the Prosecutor General's Office stating that the investigation into Umar Zabiyev's killing had been suspended on 19 June 2004 and resumed on 2 February 2006. 26. On 11 June 2003 the district prosecutor's office instituted an investigation into the killing of Umar Zabiyev under Article 105 § 1 (murder) and Article 222 § 1 (unlawful acquisition and possession of firearms) of the Russian Criminal Code. The case file was assigned the number 23600032. 27. On 11 June 2003 the crime scene was inspected and a post-mortem examination of Umar Zabiyev's body was ordered. 28. On 12 June 2003 the first applicant was granted victim status and questioned. She stated that at about 7 p.m. on 10 June 2003, while she had been travelling with her two sons in the ZIL-130 lorry, unidentified persons had opened fire. As a result she had suffered wounds to her neck and back. Ali and Umar Zabiyev had taken her out of the car and brought her into the forest. Ali had gone to the village for help, while Umar had dragged the first applicant to a hill. At some point she had lost consciousness. The first applicant had recovered her senses after the arrival of the police and the villagers of Galashki. Umar Zabiyev had not been seen anywhere around. The first applicant had not heard any voices and did not know who had shot at the car. 29. On 12 June 2003 Ali Zabiyev was granted victim status and questioned. He stated that at 7.10 p.m. on 10 June 2003 their ZIL-130 lorry had been fired at from machine guns. The vehicle had hit a tree and stopped. Ali and Umar had taken their wounded mother out of the lorry and brought her into the forest. Umar had asked Ali to go searching for help, which Ali had done. Having returned to the scene of the incident, Ali, the police and the fellow villagers had found the first applicant, who had then been transferred to hospital. Umar Zabiyev had disappeared; on 11 June 2003 his dead body had been found. 30. On 13 June 2003 Mr D. and Mr O. were questioned. They stated that at about 8 p.m. on 10 June 2003 Ali Zabiyev had run towards them and told them that the ZIL lorry had been fired at. They had reported the shooting to the police and gone to the scene of the incident. There they had found the first applicant unconscious; Umar Zabiyev had disappeared. While searching for Umar Zabiyev, Mr D. and Mr O. had stumbled across a group of armed men. The men had pointed their firearms at Mr D. and Mr O., verified whether they had had any weapons and checked their identity papers. Then they had questioned Mr D. and Mr O. about their reasons for being in the forest and left in the direction of the village of Dattykh. On the following day Umar Zabiyev's dead body had been found buried some 20 or 30 metres from the place where the witnesses had met the armed men. 31. The investigators verified Mr D.'s and Mr O.'s statements. Within 20 metres from Umar Zabiyev's grave they found an area with eight sleeping berths and the following items: empty plastic mineral water bottles, empty plastic bags, empty tin cans marked “Boiled Buckwheat”, “Cooked Rice”, “Liver Pâté with Pork Fat” and other items bearing the stamp “Military Supply of Provisions” («Оборонпродкомплект»), a pair of worn socks, a piece of bandage with traces of blood and a portable remote-control detonator PM-4 No. 3144 1-99 («переносная подрывная машинка ПМ4»). 32. The items found at the scene of the incident, the ZIL-130 lorry and a bullet extracted from Umar Zabiyev's body were subjected to forensic, ballistic, dactylographic, medical, olfactory and biological expert examinations carried out in July and August 2003. 33. The ballistic expert examinations established that the bullet extracted from Umar Zabiyev's dead body had been fired from a Kalashnikov machine gun of 7.62 mm calibre. 217 cartridge cases presented for examination had been parts of cartridges of 7.62 mm calibre produced in Russia according to the 1981 standards and suitable for Mosin and Dragunov sniper rifles, as well as for Kalashnikov machine guns. The cartridge cases in question had been fired from two firearms. Cartridge belts presented for examination had been additional parts for a Kalashnikov machine gun of 7.62 mm calibre. 34. The forensic expert examination established that the ZIL-130 lorry had had 112 penetrating bullet holes that could have been fired from a firearm of 7.62 mm calibre. 35. The medical forensic expert examination found no traces of shots fired from short range on Umar Zabiyev's clothes. 36. On 16 June 2003 a dactylographic expert examination of servicemen of military intelligence unit no. 194 KTG was ordered. 37. On 1 July 2003 the district prosecutor's office requested the military commander of the Leninskiy District of Grozny to submit a list of servicemen who had participated in search activities in the vicinity of the villages of Galashki and Dattykh between 8 and 10 June 2003 and to carry out investigative measures in respect of them. 38. The dactylographic expert examinations established that fingerprints left on the items found at the scene of the incident were not identical to those of the servicemen who had been checked regarding their possible involvement in the crime, including S.P. 39. The biological expert examination of saliva left on the cigarette butts found at the crime scene and the olfactory expert examination of the socks and the piece of bandage produced no significant results. 40. The investigators requested information on the portable remote-control detonator from the UGA. On 7 June 2004 the head of engineer troops of the North Caucasus Circuit replied that portable remote-control detonators PM-4 No. 3144 issued in 1999 had not been supplied to the North Caucasus Circuit armouries and had not been sent to its military units. 41. The medical expert examination of the first applicant established that she had sustained mildly severe bodily injuries inflicted by hand-held firearms. 42. On an unspecified date an investigation into the infliction of bodily injuries on the first applicant was instituted under Article 112 § 1 of the Russian Criminal Code. It is unclear what number the case was assigned and whether any progress was made in the investigation. 43. On 7 and 10 July 2003 the district prosecutor's office sent unspecified orders to the Sunzhenskiy District Department of the Interior and to the UGA military prosecutor respectively. 44. On 23 July 2003 the district prosecutor's office sent an unspecified order to the Ingushetia Department of the Federal Security Service. 45. On 8 December 2003 the district prosecutor's office sent an unspecified order to the prosecutor of the North Caucasus Circuit. 46. In January and February 2004 ballistic and dactylographic expert examinations were carried out. 47. On 3 February 2004 the fingerprints of S.P. and sixteen servicemen of military intelligence unit no. 194 KTG were taken and compared with the fingerprints detected on the cans found near the scene of the incident. None of the fingerprints left on the cans corresponded to those of the servicemen in question. 48. On an unspecified date the firearms used by the servicemen of military intelligence unit no. 194 KTG were subjected to a ballistic expert examination. 49. On 13 February 2004 the district prosecutor's office sent an unspecified order to the Sunzhenskiy District Department of the Interior. 50. On 20 May 2004 the district prosecutor's office sent an unspecified order to the UGA military prosecutor. 51. On 19 June 2004 the investigation was suspended. 52. According to the Government, it follows from the investigation file that on 10 June 2003 there was an armed confrontation between federal servicemen and a group of around ten insurgents in the vicinity of the village of Galashki, as a result of which two insurgents were killed and three wounded. An intelligence squad under the command of Lieutenant S.P. participated in the confrontation. In their submissions of 25 December 2007 the Government submitted that it had been impossible to either prove or refute the involvement of S.P. or other federal servicemen in the killing of Umar Zabiyev. 53. Lieutenant-Colonel N.B. was questioned as a witness and stated that the information on the armed confrontation of the federal troops with the group of around ten insurgents, as a result of which two insurgents had been killed and three wounded, had been based on a report made by a duty officer of the UGA information centre and then issued as a press release. No other sources of that information had been found and its veracity was being checked. 54. In their submissions of 12 May 2008 the Government stated that no reliable evidence had been obtained by that time to prove the involvement of S.P. or other federal servicemen in Umar Zabiyev's killing. 55. The investigation was resumed and suspended a number of times. It failed to find any evidence to support the involvement of the Russian federal military in the crime but was pending. Investigative measures were being taken to solve the murder of Umar Zabiyev. 56. Despite specific requests by the Court the Government did not disclose any material from the investigation file in case no. 2360032. Relying on the information obtained from the Prosecutor General's Office, the Government stated that the investigation was in progress and that disclosure of the documents would be in violation of Article 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, since the file contained information of a military nature and personal data concerning the witnesses or other participants in the criminal proceedings. 57.

LITHUANIA,1,Violation of Art. 14+8;Not necessary to examine Art. 8;No violation of Art. 10 or 14+10;Pecuniary damage - financial award;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings,,"10. The first applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Šiauliai. The second applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Vilnius. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 11. In 1974 the first applicant graduated from the Lithuanian Physical Culture Institute, qualifying as a certified sports instructor. 12. From 1975 to 1986 he was an employee of the Lithuanian branch of the Soviet Security Service (the KGB). After Lithuania declared its independence in 1990, he found employment as a tax inspector at the Inland Revenue. 13. On 31 May 1999 two authorities – the Lithuanian State Security Department and the Centre for Research into the Genocide and Resistance of the Lithuanian People – jointly concluded that the first applicant was subject to the restrictions provided under section 2 of the Law on the evaluation of the USSR State Security Committee (NKVD, NKGB, MGB, KGB) and the present activities of former permanent employees of the organisation (“the KGB Act” – see paragraph 24 below). The conclusion confirmed that the first applicant had the status of a “former KGB officer” (see paragraphs 26-27 below). On 2 June 1999 the first applicant was dismissed from the Inland Revenue on the basis of that conclusion. 14. The first applicant brought an administrative action against the security intelligence authorities, claiming that he had been engaged only in counterintelligence and ideology work while employed by the KGB, and that he had not been involved in the violation of individual rights by that organisation. He argued that his dismissal under section 2 of the KGB Act and the resultant inability to find employment were therefore unlawful. 15. On 9 September 1999 the Higher Administrative Court found that the conclusion of 31 May 1999 had been substantiated and that the first applicant was subject to the restrictions provided under section 2 of the KGB Act. In this respect, the court held that the applicant had the status of a “former KGB officer” within the meaning of the KGB Act, since he had occupied one of the positions mentioned in the list of 26 January 1999. 16. On 19 October 1999 the Court of Appeal dismissed the first applicant’s appeal. It found that he had not occupied a KGB position dealing only with criminal investigations and could not therefore benefit from the exceptions listed under section 3 of the KGB Act. 17. On an unspecified date in the 1980s, the second applicant graduated from Vilnius University as a qualified lawyer. 18. From 11 February 1991 he worked as a prosecutor at the Office of the Prosecutor General of Lithuania, investigating primarily cases of organised crime and corruption. 19. On 26 May 1999 the Lithuanian State Security Department and the Centre for Research into the Genocide and Resistance of the Lithuanian People jointly concluded that from 1985 to 1991 the second applicant had been an employee of the Lithuanian branch of the KGB, that he had the status of a “former KGB officer” and that he was thereby subject to the restrictions provided under section 2 of the KGB Act. On 31 May 1999 the second applicant was dismissed from his job at the Office of the Prosecutor General on the basis of that conclusion. 20. The second applicant brought an administrative action against the security intelligence authorities and the Office of the Prosecutor General. He claimed that from 1985 to 1990 he had merely studied at a special KGB school in Moscow and that from 1990 to 1991 he had worked in the KGB as an informer for the Lithuanian security intelligence authorities and should therefore be entitled to benefit from the exceptions under section 3 of the KGB Act. He claimed that his dismissal under the Act and his resultant inability to find employment were unlawful. 21. On 6 August 1999 the Higher Administrative Court allowed the second applicant’s claim, quashed the conclusion of 26 May 1999 and ordered him to be reinstated. The court found that the period of the second applicant’s studies at the KGB school from 1985 to 1990 was not to be taken into account for the purposes of the KGB Act, that he had worked in the KGB for a period of five months in 1990-91, that he had not occupied a KGB position dealing with political investigations and that, in any event, he had been a secret informer for the Lithuanian authorities. The court concluded that the exceptions under section 3 of the KGB Act applied to the second applicant and that his dismissal had therefore been unlawful. 22. Following an appeal by the security intelligence authorities, on 25 October 1999 the Court of Appeal quashed the judgment of 6 August 1999. It held that, although the first-instance court had properly found that the second applicant had worked at the KGB for only five months, it had not been established that he had worked there as a secret informer for the Lithuanian authorities. Accordingly, he could not benefit from the exceptions under section 3 of the KGB Act. 23. The second applicant appealed against the Court of Appeal’s judgment. By a decision of 28 January 2000, the President of the Supreme Court allowed the appeal. However, by a final decision of 20 April 2000, the full Supreme Court refused to examine the appeal and discontinued the proceedings for lack of jurisdiction. 24. The Law on the evaluation of the USSR State Security Committee (NKVD, NKGB, MGB, KGB) and the present activities of former permanent employees of the organisation (Įstatymas dėl SSRS valstybės saugumo komiteto (NKVD, NKGB, MGB, KGB) vertinimo ir šios organizacijos kadrinių darbuotojų dabartinės veiklos – “the KGB Act”) was enacted on 16 July 1998 by the Seimas (the Lithuanian parliament) and promulgated by the President of the Republic. The KGB Act reads as follows: “The USSR State Security Committee (NKVD, NKGB, MGB, KGB – hereinafter ‘the SSC’) is recognised as a criminal organisation which was responsible for war crimes, genocide, repression, terror and political persecution in the territory of Lithuania when occupied by the USSR.” “For a period of ten years from the date of entry into force of this Act, former employees of the SSC may not work as public officials or civil servants in government, local or defence authorities, the State Security Department, the police, the prosecution, courts or diplomatic service, customs, State supervisory bodies and other authorities monitoring public institutions, as lawyers or notaries, as employees of banks and other credit institutions, on strategic economic projects, in security companies (structures), in other companies (structures) providing detective services, in communications systems, or in the educational system as teachers, educators or heads of institutions[;] nor may they perform a job requiring the carrying of a weapon.” “(1) The restrictions provided for in section 2 shall not be applied to former permanent employees of the SSC who, while working at the SSC, investigated only criminal cases and who discontinued their work at the SSC not later than 11 March 1990. (2) The Centre for Research into the Genocide and Resistance of the Lithuanian People and the State Security Department may [recommend by] a reasoned application that no restrictions under this law be applied to former permanent employees of the SSC who, within three months of the date of the entry into force of this Law, report to the State Security Department and disclose all information in their possession ... about their former work at the SSC and their current relations with former SSC employees and agents. A decision in this respect shall be taken by a commission of three persons set up by the President of the Republic. No employees of the Centre for Research into the Genocide and Resistance of the Lithuanian People or the State Security Department may be appointed to the commission. The commission’s rules shall be confirmed by the President of the Republic.” “The procedure for implementation of the Act shall be governed by [a special law].” “This Act shall come into force on 1 January 1999.” 25. Following the examination by the Constitutional Court of the compatibility of the KGB Act with the Constitution (see paragraph 28 below), on 5 May 1999 section 3 of the KGB Act was amended to the effect that even those individuals who had worked for the KGB after 11 March 1990 could be eligible for the exceptions under section 3 of that Act. 26. On 16 July 1998 a separate law on the implementation of the KGB Act was enacted. Under that law, the Centre for Research into the Genocide and Resistance of the Lithuanian People and the State Security Department were empowered to reach a conclusion on an individual’s status as a “former permanent employee of the KGB” (“former KGB officer”) for the purposes of the KGB Act. 27. On 26 January 1999 the Government adopted a list (“the list”) of positions in various branches of the KGB on Lithuanian territory attesting to a person’s status as a “former KGB officer” for the purposes of the KGB Act. A total of 395 different positions were listed in this respect. 28. On 4 March 1999 the Constitutional Court examined the issue of the KGB Act’s compatibility with the Constitution. The Constitutional Court held in particular that the KGB Act had been passed in order to carry out “security screening” measures on former KGB officers, who were deemed to be lacking in loyalty to the Lithuanian State. The Constitutional Court decided that the prohibition on former KGB officers occupying public posts was compatible with the Constitution. It further ruled that the statutory ban on the holding by former KGB officers of jobs in various branches of the private sector was compatible with the constitutional principle of a free choice of profession in that the State was entitled to lay down specific requirements for persons applying for work in the most important economic sectors in order to ensure the protection of national security and proper functioning of the educational and financial systems. The Constitutional Court also held that the restrictions under the KGB Act did not amount to a criminal charge against former KGB officers. 29. While the KGB Act does not specifically guarantee a right of access to a court to contest the security intelligence authorities’ conclusion, it was recognised by the domestic courts that, as a matter of practice, a dismissal from employment in the public service on the basis of that conclusion gave rise to an administrative court action (and a further appeal) under the general procedure governing industrial disputes and alleged breaches of personal rights by the public authorities, under Articles 4, 7, 8, 26, 49, 50, 59, 63 and 64 of the Code of Administrative Procedure, Article 222 of the Civil Code and Article 336 of the Code of Civil Procedure (as in force at the material time). 30. Restrictions have been imposed in many post-communist countries with a view to screening the employment of former security agents or active collaborators in the former regimes. In this connection, international human rights bodies have at times found fault with such legislation where it has lacked precision or proportionality, and have characterised it as discrimination in employment or the exercise of a profession on the basis of political opinion (see below). The possibility of appealing to the courts has been considered a significant safeguard, although not sufficient in itself to rectify shortcomings in the legislation. 31. Article 1 § 2 of the European Social Charter provides: “With a view to ensuring the effective exercise of the right to work, the Parties undertake: ... 2. to protect effectively the right of the worker to earn his living in an occupation freely entered upon[.]” This provision, retained word for word in the revised Charter of 1996 (which came into force with regard to Lithuania on 1 August 2001), has been consistently interpreted by the European Committee of Social Rights (ECSR) as establishing a right not to be discriminated against in employment. The non-discrimination guarantee is stipulated in Article E of the revised Charter in the following terms: “The enjoyment of the rights set forth in this Charter shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national extraction or social origin, health, association with a national minority, birth or other status.” The question of the dismissal of public servants on account of their activities under totalitarian regimes has been addressed in the light of these provisions, at least as regards Germany. In its most recent examination of Germany’s compliance with Article 1 § 2 of the Charter (published in November 2002), the ECSR took note of the provisions of the reunification treaty that allow for the dismissal of public servants on the basis of their activities on behalf of the security services of the German Democratic Republic. It concluded that Germany was not complying with its obligations. This was expanded upon in the following terms: “The Committee observes that there is no precise definition of the functions from which individuals can be excluded, either in the form of a refusal to recruit or a dismissal, on the grounds of previous political activities or activities within the former GDR institutions competent in security matters. The Committee has examined the conformity of these provisions in the light of Article 31 of the Charter. Under this provision, restriction of a right enshrined in the Charter is permitted if it is prescribed by law, is necessary in a democratic society and serves one of the purposes listed in the Article. Whilst recognising that the provisions were prescribed by law within the meaning of Article 31 and served one of the purposes listed therein, namely the protection of national security, the Committee considered that they were not necessary within the meaning of Article 31 in that they did not apply solely to services which had responsibilities in the fields of law and order and national security or to functions involving such responsibilities.” The ECSR adopted its conclusions in regard to Lithuania’s implementation of the revised Charter on 28 May 2004. They will be made public at a later date. 32. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) has also adopted a number of relevant international legal instruments. The most pertinent text is ILO Convention no. 111 on Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) of 1958. In its 1996 General Survey, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) restated its interpretation of Convention no. 111, drawing upon examples taken from national law. Regarding Germany, the CEACR’s position was the following (§ 196): “The Committee does not accept the argument that in cases in which persons had been accused of having carried out political activities in the former German Democratic Republic, the more the person had, by the assumption of certain functions, identified himself or herself with that unjust regime, the more incriminated he or she was, and the less reasonable it was that this person hold a position in the current administration.” More recently, however, the CEACR has expressed satisfaction with the German courts’ observance of the principle of proportionality in cases where civil servants challenge their dismissal (see paragraph 3 of the Individual Observation to Germany under Convention no. 111 in 2000). A 1996 survey identifies comparable provisions in the domestic law of a number of other European States. In Bulgaria, section 9 of the Preceding and Concluding Provisions of the Banks and Credit Activity Act of 1992 excluded persons who had served the previous regime in certain capacities from employment in banks. The Bulgarian Constitutional Court ruled in 1992 that this provision was in violation of the Constitution and of ILO Convention no. 111. In the former Czechoslovakia, the so-called Screening Act was passed in 1991, preventing persons who had served the previous regime in a number of capacities from taking up employment in the civil service or parts of the private sector. This legislation was declared unconstitutional by the Slovak Constitutional Court in 1996, which further found it to be incompatible with Convention no. 111. However, it remained in force in the Czech Republic, while the CEACR urged the Czech authorities to have due regard to the principle of proportionality in the application of the Act. In Latvia, the State Civil Service Act of 2000 and the Police Act of 1999 prohibit the employment of persons who worked for or with the KGB. In 2003 the CEACR expressed its dissatisfaction with the above texts in the following terms: “6. The Committee recalls that requirements of a political nature can be set for a particular job, but to ensure that they are not contrary to the Convention, they should be limited to the characteristics of a particular post and be in proportion to its labour requirements. The Committee notes that the above-established exclusions by the provisions under examination apply broadly to the entire civil service and police rather than to specific jobs, functions or tasks. The Committee is concerned that these provisions appear to go beyond justifiable exclusions in respect of a particular job based on its inherent requirements as provided for under Article 1 (2) of the Convention. The Committee recalls that for measures not to be deemed discriminatory under Article 4, they must be measures affecting an individual on account of activities he or she is justifiably suspected or proved to be engaged in which are prejudicial to the security of the State. Article 4 of the Convention does not exclude from the definition of discrimination measures taken by reason of membership of a particular group or community. The Committee also notes that in cases where persons are deemed to be justifiably suspected of or engaged in activities prejudicial to the security of the State, the individual concerned shall have the right to appeal to a competent body in accordance with national practice. 7. In the light of the above, the Committee considers the exclusions from being a candidate for any civil service position and from being employed by the police are not sufficiently well defined and delimited to ensure that they do not become discrimination in employment and occupation based on political opinion ...”","['14', '8']",[],[],['10'],[],[],1
131,001-57592,ENG,NLD,CHAMBER,1984,"CASE OF VAN DER SLUIJS, ZUIDERVELD AND KLAPPE v. THE NETHERLANDS",2,Preliminary objection rejected (victim);Violation of Art. 5-3;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award,,"12. Mr. van der Sluijs, Mr. Zuiderveld and Mr. Klappe, who were born in 1960, 1956 and 1955 respectively, reside in the Netherlands. In 1981, after being forcibly drafted as conscript soldiers in the Netherlands Armed Forces, they each refused, on account of their beliefs as conscientious objectors, to obey specific orders deriving from their obligation to perform military service. They were placed in detention by the competent military officers for suspected offences against the Military Penal Code (Wetboek van Militair Strafrecht). They were kept in custody and referred for trial before a military court. 13. Exemption may be obtained from compulsory military service on the ground of conscientious objection, both before and after active military service has begun. The procedure for requesting such exemption is laid down in the Conscientious Objection to Military Service Act (Wet Gewetensbezwaren Militaire Dienst) and a Ministerial Decree of 31 July 1970. In particular, where military criminal proceedings are in progress against a conscript serviceman who has applied for the status of conscientious objector, they may be stayed before, and must be stayed once, the Advisory Board on Conscientious Objectors has commenced its enquiries (section 4 sub-section 3 of the Act). After the Advisory Board has stated its opinion, the Minister of Defence may grant recognition as a conscientious objector (section 7). The entitlement to conduct criminal proceedings for failure to obey orders or military regulations or for failure to report for enlistment lapses automatically upon recognition of the accused’s conscientious objection (section 10). In the present case, Mr. van der Sluijs requested to be granted the status of conscientious objector only in the final stages of his appeal before the Supreme Military Court (see paragraph 25 below), whereas Mr. Zuiderveld and Mr. Klappe never at any moment did so (see paragraphs 26-34 below). 14. Criminal procedure for the military land and air forces, including in particular the matter of arrest and detention on remand, is governed by the Army and Air Force Code of Procedure (Rechtspleging bij de Land-en Luchtmacht - ""the Military Code""), as last amended on 24 November 1978. Offences under military criminal law, which applies equally to conscript servicemen such as the applicants and to volunteers, are tried at first instance before a Military Court (Krijgsraad). There may be an appeal to the Supreme Military Court (Hoog Militair Gerechtshof) and ultimately a (cassation) appeal on points of law to the Supreme Court (Hoge Raad) of the Netherlands. 15. Every officer and non-commissioned officer is empowered to arrest military personnel of lower rank suspected of a serious offence provided the circumstances require immediate deprivation of liberty (Article 4 of the Military Code). The resultant detention is not to exceed twenty-four hours (Article 5). The commanding officer may order a suspected serviceman to be placed or kept in custody on remand if (a) there is a serious risk of absconding or (b) there are important reasons of public safety requiring immediate deprivation of liberty or (c) this is necessary in connection with the maintenance of military discipline among other servicemen (Article 7, second paragraph). Such a detention order may be made against a serviceman suspected of any offence set out in the Military Penal Code or any offence in respect of which detention on remand is permitted under the civilian Code of Criminal Procedure, with the exception of those offences of which the Military Court takes no cognisance (Article 7, fourth paragraph). An order may not be issued if the suspect is unlikely to be penalised by unconditional imprisonment or by any other measure restricting his freedom, or is likely to be given a sentence of shorter duration than that of the detention on remand (ibid.). Detention must be terminated once the grounds for it cease to exist (Article 7, fifth paragraph). All cases of detention exceeding four days shall be reported by the commanding officer to the commanding general (Article 7, sixth paragraph). Where detention has lasted fourteen days, the suspected serviceman may petition the competent Military Court to fix a term (liable to extension) within which the commanding general must either decide whether the case is to be referred to a Military Court or else terminate the detention. The Military Court has to rule on the petition without delay, after hearing the authority empowered to refer the case, the auditeur-militair (see paragraph 20 below) and the suspected serviceman, who may have the assistance of an adviser (Article 13). 16. If, after receiving the advice of the auditeur-militair and, ""if possible"" (""zo mogelijk""), after the suspected serviceman has been heard, the commanding general or a senior officer (hoofd officier) designated by him to act on his behalf considers that the case should be tried by the Military Court, the serviceman shall be referred for trial before that Court (Article 11). On the other hand, the commanding general or the designated officer may in appropriate circumstances leave the case to be dealt with as a disciplinary matter (Article 12). Regulation No. 27/7 of the Ministry of Defence explained the effect of these provisions as follows (translation from the Dutch): ""In military penal procedure, as distinct from civilian procedure, the decision to prosecute in a case is not taken separately by the prosecuting authority, the auditeur-militair, but by a military authority. That authority is the commanding general or the senior officer he has appointed to act on his behalf, i.e. the referring officer ... Thus, the auditeur-militair is merely an advisory body at this stage, although the obtaining of his advice and the giving of that advice by him are mandatory."" Any decision to refer for trial must be in writing and state whether the suspected serviceman is to be released or kept in custody; the grounds for detention set out in the second and fourth paragraphs of Article 7 (see paragraph 15 above) apply pari passu (Article 14). If, against the advice of the auditeur-militair, the commanding general or designated senior officer chooses not to refer a suspected serviceman for trial, the auditeur-militair may take the matter to the Supreme Military Court (Article 15). No appeal is provided for in the contrary case. According to the Government, it has now become standard procedure to apply the above provisions of the Military Code in the following manner. Where detention on remand has been ordered, the suspected serviceman is always heard by the auditeur-militair and any referral to the Military Court takes place shortly thereafter, on average four to five days after the arrest. In view of the requirements of Article 14 of the Military Code, the auditeur-militair’s assessment of the circumstances and his advice to the commanding general or designated senior officer cover not only referral for trial but also the question whether the conditions for detention on remand set out in Article 7 are fulfilled. Thus, the standard written form used by the auditeur-militair for the purposes of transmitting his advice to the referring officer contains, inter alia, a paragraph as to whether the suspect should ""be released or be placed or kept in custody"". Practice has evolved to the point where the advice of the auditeur-militair is invariably followed and generally regarded as binding. 17. Detention maintained or ordered in the decision referring the serviceman for trial may not exceed fourteen days unless extended, by terms of thirty days, by the Military Court at the request of the auditeur-militair (Article 31). Every accused detained by virtue of the referral decision must be heard by the officier-commissaris (see paragraph 21 below) as speedily as possible and in any event within four days of referral; in this connection, the accused may be assisted by an adviser (Article 33, first paragraph). Before extending detention, the Military Court must give the accused or his adviser the opportunity to submit argument (Article 33, second paragraph). As soon as the grounds for the detention cease to exist, release must be ordered (Article 34, first paragraph). In the period between referral and commencement of the trial, power to order release is exercisable by the auditeur-militair, or by the Military Court at the request of either the officier-commissaris or the detained serviceman himself (Article 34, second paragraph). The Military Court, in deciding on such requests, will hear the auditeur-militair and also the detained serviceman or his adviser where the serviceman is requesting release for the first time (Article 34, third paragraph). 18. If the accused is in custody at the first hearing, the Military Court will decide, after being addressed by the auditeur-militair, whether or not the nature and circumstances of the case require his continued detention during the trial (Article 151). The Court may direct the accused’s release from detention on remand at any later stage in the proceedings, either of its own motion or at the request of the auditeur-militair or the accused himself (Article 156). 19. A serviceman in custody may request release or suspension of his detention under Article 219 of the Military Code in proceedings before the Supreme Military Court pending the decision on his appeal, and under section 5 of the Military Cassation Act (Militaire Cassatiewet) in proceedings before the Supreme Court pending the decision on his appeal on points of law. 20. The auditeur-militair has the function of prosecuting authority before the Military Court (Article 126, first paragraph). No serving member of the armed forces may appear as auditeur-militair or substitute auditeur-militair (Article 126, third paragraph). The auditeur-militair and his substitute may be replaced by an acting auditeur-militair (plaatsvervanger - Article 126, second paragraph) who may be a military officer, but such replacement was said by the Government to occur only in exceptional circumstances. Auditeurs-militair (including substitutes and acting ones) are appointed, and dismissed, by the Crown on a joint proposal from the Ministers of Justice and Defence; they must possess a law degree (Article 126, fourth and sixth paragraphs). Under the terms of Article 276, second paragraph, of the Military Code, they are obliged to comply with instructions given to them in their official capacity by the Minister of Justice. However, according to the Government, this latter provision serves as no more than the legal authority for issuing general guidelines on prosecution policy and, at least in recent years, no Minister of Justice has acted or interfered in a concrete case on the basis of Article 276. The auditeur-militair is bound by his oath to act honestly and impartially (Articles 368 and 370). He must attend the hearings of the Military Court (Article 290) but he does not take part in the Court’s deliberations. He is under a general duty to assist the Military Court, as well as the commanding general, with reports, observations and advice in relation to military justice when required to do so (Article 278). He is not under the supervision of the Military Court or the Supreme Military Court in the discharge of his duties, save that the Supreme Military Court has the power to reprimand him should he fail strictly to observe statutory time-limits (Article 297). 21. Attached to each Military Court is at least one officier-commissaris who is in charge of the preliminary investigation of cases (Article 29). An officier-commissaris is an officer or former officer of the armed forces with the rank of captain or higher and is appointed for a fixed term of at least one year by the commanding general (ibid.). While he may at the same time be a member of the Military Court, this is not usually the case. His task of preliminary investigation involves gathering the facts and hearing witnesses and the accused when necessary (Articles 29, 48 and 78). A hearing by the officier-commissaris has the same force as a hearing by the Military Court (Article 161). During his enquiries, he is under a duty to apply himself equally to discovering the accused’s innocence and to obtaining proof or admission of guilt (Article 62). Like the auditeur-militair, he is bound by his oath to act honestly and impartially (Articles 368 and 370). 22. Following his failure to register in due time as a conscript serviceman, Mr. van der Sluijs was arrested on 13 March 1981 and transferred to a military house of detention. Upon his arrival, he refused to put on a military uniform and to take receipt of a weapon. He persisted in his refusal although his hierarchical superior pointed out to him that in doing so he committed the criminal offence of insubordination (Article 114 of the Military Penal Code). The commanding officer then confirmed the arrest, the grounds relied on being a serious risk of his absconding and the need to maintain discipline among other servicemen (Article 7 of the Military Code - see paragraph 15 above). On 16 March, he appeared before the auditeur-militair. On 18 March, in accordance with the advice of the auditeur-militair, the designated senior officer referred the applicant for trial before the Military Court, while deciding that he should be kept in custody on the same grounds as before (Articles 11, 14 and 7, second paragraph, of the Military Code - see paragraph 16 above). 23. On 19 March, the auditeur-militair addressed a request to the Military Court that the applicant be kept in detention upon expiry on 1 April of the fourteen-day maximum period allowed for under the law (Article 31 of the Military Code - see paragraph 17 above) as the grounds prevailing on 18 March were still valid in his view. On 20 March, the applicant was heard by the officier-commissaris (Article 33, first paragraph, of the Military Code - ibid.). On 25 March, he appeared before the Military Court. Counsel for Mr. van der Sluijs submitted that his client’s detention was unlawful since the requirements of Article 5 § 3 (art. 5-3) of the Convention had not been complied with, in particular because the officier-commissaris was not vested with autonomous power to decide on the accused’s detention. The Military Court rejected the applicant’s arguments and prolonged the detention by a thirty-day term. Thereafter his detention was regularly prolonged by the Military Court. 24. The trial took place before the Military Court on 21 May. On 3 June, the applicant was convicted of acts of insubordination and sentenced to eighteen months’ imprisonment, the time spent in custody on remand to be deducted therefrom. 25. Mr. van der Sluijs then appealed to the Supreme Military Court. Pending his appeal, he sought suspension of his sentence for a period of two weeks for personal reasons (Article 219 of the Military Code - see paragraph 19 above). The Supreme Military Court rejected that request on 1 July. On 30 July, he requested the Supreme Military Court to suspend criminal proceedings and order his release in view of his application to be recognised as a conscientious objector (section 4 of the Conscientious Objection to Military Service Act - see paragraph 13 above). Such an application was in fact introduced with the Ministry of Defence on 4 August. On 12 August, he was heard by the Supreme Military Court, which, two days later, suspended criminal proceedings and, conditionally, the detention. Subsequently, upon recognition by the Minister of Defence of his conscientious objection, criminal proceedings lapsed and his release became final (section 10 of the above-mentioned Act - ibid.). 26. Mr. Zuiderveld was arrested on 14 February 1981 on a charge of failing to register in due time as a conscript serviceman (Article 150 of the Military Penal Code) and was transferred to a military house of detention. On 16 February, he refused to put on a military uniform and to take receipt of a weapon. He persisted in his refusal although his hierarchical superior pointed out to him that he was thereby committing the criminal offence of insubordination (Article 114 of the Military Penal Code). The commanding officer then confirmed the arrest, the grounds relied on being a serious risk of his absconding and the need to maintain discipline amongst other servicemen (Article 7 of the Military Code - see paragraph 15 above). On 17 February, the applicant was heard by the auditeur-militair. Later that day, in accordance with the advice of the auditeur-militair, the designated senior officer referred him for trial before the Military Court, while deciding that he should be kept in custody on the same grounds as before (Articles 11, 14 and 7, second paragraph, of the Military Code - see paragraph 16 above). 27. On 18 February, he was heard by the officier-commissaris (Article 33, first paragraph, of the Military Code - see paragraph 17 above). On 25 February, on request by the auditeur-militair, the Military Court prolonged the applicant’s detention by thirty days upon expiry on 2 March of the fourteen-day maximum period allowed for under the law (Article 31 of the Military Code - ibid.). Neither Mr. Zuiderveld nor his lawyer availed himself of the opportunity to submit argument (Article 33, second paragraph - ibid.). On 25 March, the Military Court examined a further request by the auditeur-militair for prolongation of the detention. At this hearing, counsel for Mr. Zuiderveld submitted that his client’s detention was unlawful since the requirements of Article 5 § 3 (art. 5-3) of the Convention had not been complied with, in particular because the officier-commissaris was not vested with autonomous power to decide officier-commissaris was not vested with the autonomous power to decide on the accused’s detention. The Military Court rejected the applicant’s arguments and prolonged the detention by a further thirty-day term. Thereafter his detention was regularly prolonged by the Military Court. 28. Trial hearings took place before the Military Court on 27 and 29 May. The applicant once more submitted, inter alia, that his detention was unlawful for failure to comply with Article 5 § 3 (art. 5-3) of the Convention. The Court, on 29 May, rejected his arguments and maintained his detention. On 11 June, Mr. Zuiderveld was acquitted of the charge of failure to register for military service but convicted of acts of insubordination. He was sentenced to eighteen months’ imprisonment, the time spent on remand to be deducted therefrom. 29. The applicant then appealed to the Supreme Military Court. On 16 September, the Supreme Military Court quashed, for a procedural defect, the Military Court’s decision of 29 May prolonging the detention. Holding that the detention had accordingly been unlawful from 1 June onwards, the Supreme Military Court ordered Mr. Zuiderveld’s release. On the same day, the Minister of Defence suspended the remainder of the sentence. On 2 December, the Supreme Military Court reversed the judgment of the lower court with reference to its reasoning; the Supreme Military Court also found the applicant guilty, but reduced the sentence to one of fourteen months’ imprisonment, the time spent in custody on remand between 14 February and 1 June to be deducted therefrom. 30. The applicant entered an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court. On 22 June 1982, the Supreme Court set aside the sentence of the Supreme Military Court and referred the case back to that Court (Nederlandse Jurisprudentie, 1983, no. 413). On 29 September, the Supreme Military Court sentenced Mr. Zuiderveld to 214 days’ imprisonment, the time spent in custody on remand, which also totalled 214 days, to be deducted therefrom. 31. Mr. Klappe was arrested on 28 January 1981 on a charge of failing to register in due time as a conscript serviceman (Article 150 of the Military Penal Code) and transferred to a military house of detention. On 29 January, he refused to put on a military uniform and to take receipt of a weapon. He persisted in his refusal although his hierarchical superior pointed out to him that in doing so he committed the criminal offence of insubordination (Article 114 of the Military Penal Code). The commanding officer then confirmed the arrest, the grounds relied on being a serious risk of his absconding and the need to maintain discipline amongst other servicemen (Article 7 of the Military Code - see paragraph 15 above). On 30 January, the applicant appeared before the auditeur-militair. Later that day, the designated senior officer referred him for trial before the Military Court, while deciding that he should be kept in custody on the same grounds as before (Articles 11, 14 and 7, second paragraph, of the Military Code - see paragraph 16 above). 32. The applicant was also heard by the officier-commissaris on 30 January (Article 33, first paragraph, of the Military Code - see paragraph 17 above). On 11 February, following a request by the auditeur-militair for extension of the detention (Article 31 of the Military Code - ibid.), the applicant appeared before the Military Court. Counsel for Mr. Klappe submitted that his client’s detention was unlawful since the requirements of Article 5 § 3 (art. 5-3) of the Convention had not been complied with, in particular because the officier-commissaris could not be regarded as a judicial officer for the purposes of that provision. The Military Court rejected the applicant’s arguments and prolonged the detention by a thirty-day term. On a further request by the auditeur-militair, this decision was renewed by the Military Court on 11 March. 33. The trial took place before the Military Court on 26 March. On 8 April, the applicant was convicted of insubordination and failure to register for military service and sentenced to eighteen months’ imprisonment, the time spent in custody on remand to be deducted therefrom. 34. The applicant appealed to the Supreme Military Court. On 27 April, he requested the suspension of his sentence for one day in order to address a political meeting on 1 May (Article 219 of the Military Code - see paragraph 19 above). The Supreme Military Court acceded to this request on 28 April. At a hearing on 17 June, the applicant once more requested his release, invoking Article 5 § 3 (art. 5-3) of the Convention. The Supreme Military Court delivered judgment on 1 July. It rejected the applicant’s request for release, holding that a decision on the alleged breach of Article 5 § 3 (art. 5-3) of the Convention was not within its competence. On the other hand, the Supreme Military Court reversed the judgment of the lower court with reference to its reasoning, but, also finding the applicant guilty, imposed an identical sentence of eighteen months’ imprisonment subject to deduction of the time spent in custody on remand.",['5'],['5-3'],[],[],[],[],1

On 27 August 2003 the Wood Professional Association (HBG HolzBerufsgenossenschaft) refused to recognise the applicant’s respiratory diseases as an occupational disease (Berufskrankheit). 6. On 26 September 2003 the applicant, represented by lawyer, filed an objection against the aforementioned decision. The objection was rejected on 23 December 2003. 7. On 14 January 2004 the applicant brought an action in the Cottbus Social Court. 8. On 11 March 2004 the respondent party submitted the statement of defence and the applicant’s files. 9. On 14 June 2004 the Social Court requested inter alia reports of 19 doctors the applicant had consulted prior to the proceedings as well as medical documentation regarding the applicant’s five prior stays in hospital. Three months later these documents had been obtained in their entirety and the Social Court submitted the documents to the parties. 10. On 8 November 2004 and on 13 January 2005 the Social Court asked the applicant to concretise the claim. On 7 February 2005 the applicant submitted that the aim of the action was to determine that he was suffering from an occupational disease. 11. On 2 May 2005 the Social Court decided to obtain a first expert opinion concerning 12 specific questions and named an expert (Mr W.M.). The applicant cancelled the first examination fixed for 29 June 2005 due to illness. On 10 August 2005 the expert examined the applicant. On 13 October 2005 the expert submitted his report of 19 pages, in which he found inter alia that a further expert opinion was necessary. 12. On 23 March 2006 the Social Court decided to obtain another expert opinion on different aspects of the 12 questions and named an expert (Ms P.H.). The expert indicated her willingness to render the expert opinion. 13. In April 2006 the applicant changed lawyer. 14. On 24 May 2006 the expert Ms P.H. informed the Social Court that the applicant should first be examined by another expert (Ms U.R.). On 4 July 2006 the applicant challenged the latter expert on grounds of bias. By letter of 7 July 2006 the Social Court rejected this challenge and informed the applicant that it considered the examination necessary. On 19 October 2006 the applicant informed the Social Court that he was willing to cooperate. 15. On 7 February 2007 the expert Ms U.R. submitted her report of 11 pages. On 29 March 2007 the Social Court submitted the files to the expert Ms P.H. in order for her to render the requested expert opinion. On 17 April 2007 Ms P.H. informed the Social Court that she was unable to give the expert opinion. 16. On 17 August 2007 the Social Court amended its decision of 23 March 2006 and named another expert (Mr D.A.). On 31 August 2007 Mr D.A. informed the Social Court that he was unable to give the expert opinion in a timely manner. 17. On 26 September 2007 the Social Court again amended its decision of 23 March 2006 and named another expert (Mr Sch.). On 10 October 2007 the Social Court was informed that Mr Sch. had retired. 18. On 10 October 2007 the Social Court again amended its decision of 23 March 2006 and named another expert (Mr V.Z.).

On 11 December 2007 the Social Court again amended its decision of 23 March 2006 and named another expert (Mr E.M.). On 29 January 2008 the latter informed the Social Court that he was unable to give the expert opinion. 20. On 12 November 2008 the Social Court made a new decision to obtain an expert opinion and named an expert (Mr H.L.). On 2 December 2008 the Social Court was informed that Mr H.L. had retired. 21. On 11 February 2009 the Social Court amended its decision of 12 November 2008 and named another expert (Mr C.S.). On 20 February 2009 Mr C.S. informed the Social Court that he was unable to give the expert opinion. 22. In February 2009 the applicant changed lawyer.

133,001-93628,ENG,MDA,CHAMBER,2009,CASE OF BAROUL PARTNER-A v. MOLDOVA,3,Violation of Art. 6-1;Violation of P1-1;Just satisfaction reserved,David Thór Björgvinsson;Giovanni Bonello;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Mihai Poalelungi;Nicolas Bratza,"5. The applicant, Baroul Partner-A, is a company incorporated in Moldova. 6. In 2000, in accordance with the Law on the Privatisation Programme for the years 1997-2000, the Government put up for sale their portion of the shares (199,875 shares, representing 65.86%) in the Soroca Gravel and Granite Quarry Co. (“the quarry”). 7. The applicant company participated in the auction and, having offered the highest price, purchased the stock in February 2000 at a price of 12.5 Moldovan lei (MDL) per share. The total price of the purchased stock was MDL 2,498,437.5. 8. In 2003 the Court of Accounts carried out a check on the privatisation activity of the Government and in a decision of 3 January 2004 found that in 1996 the quarry had received from a third State-owned company twenty-seven railway carriages without any title and that those carriages had remained in the quarry's possession throughout its subsequent existence without ever being included in the accounting documents. 9. On an unspecified date in 2004 the Department of Privatisation initiated proceedings for unjust enrichment against the quarry, claiming compensation for the railway carriages. The proceedings ended with a final judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice of 11 November 2004, by which the quarry was ordered to pay the State MDL 972,000, representing the cost of the carriages as established by an expert report. The judgment was enforced in 2005. 10. On 29 July 2006 the Centre for the Fight against Economic Crime and Corruption (“CFECC”) initiated criminal proceedings in respect of the privatisation of the quarry. The activity of the quarry was blocked as a result of the seizure of the accounting documents, the refusal to extend licences for extraction of granite and gravel, and other measures taken against the quarry by the State authorities. It appears that the criminal investigation is still pending before the CFECC and that the case has never been brought before the courts. 11. On 15 December 2006 the Prosecutor General's Office initiated, on behalf of the Government, court proceedings against the Department of Privatisation and the applicant company, seeking the annulment of the contract of sale of the State-owned stock. It argued that since at the date of the sale of the shares the quarry had not included the twenty-seven carriages in its accounting documents (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above), the price of each share had been fixed at only MDL 12.5, whereas it should have been MDL 13.88. The Prosecutor General's Office did not make reference to the proceedings which ended with the judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice of 11 November 2004. In its pleadings before the court, the Prosecutor's Office argued that its action was not time-barred since the time-limit did not apply to its court actions. 12. In its observations and pleadings, the Department of Privatisation disagreed with the Prosecutor General's action and argued that the applicant company had participated in an auction organised by the Government and had won it by offering the highest price for the shares. The auction was organised in accordance with the relevant regulations. The question of the carriages which had not been included in the quarry's accounting documents in 1996 had been resolved by the Department of Privatisation by way of civil proceedings which ended with the judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice of 11 November 2004 in favour of the Department of Privatisation. That judgment was enforced in 2005. 13. In its observations and pleadings, the applicant company argued that the Prosecutor General's action was time-barred. It was contrary to the principle of legal certainty and equality of arms to allow the Prosecutor General to challenge administrative acts in the courts without the latter being subject to any time limitations. In any event, the provision of the old Civil Code exempting the Prosecutor General from complying with the general three-year time-limit only referred to claims against kolkhozs (collective farms), non-governmental organisations, cooperatives and citizens. The applicant company did not fall within any of those categories. Finally, the dispute over the carriages had already been resolved by a final judgment of the Supreme Court of 11 November 2004. 14. On 12 April 2007 the Economic Court upheld the Prosecutor General's action and found the arguments adduced by him to be well-founded. Referring to the applicant company's objection concerning the Statute of Limitations, the court found that the three-year time-limit was applicable to the Prosecutor General's court action. At the same time, according to the court, the time-limit was to be calculated from the date when the Prosecutor General's Office found out or must have found out about the problem with the carriages. In the court's opinion, that date was 3 January 2004, the date of the Court of Accounts' decision (see paragraph 8 above). Accordingly, the action was lodged within the three-year limit. As to the applicant's objection concerning the existence of a final judgment concerning the same dispute, the court found that objection ill-founded because the first set of proceedings had concerned the issue of compensation while the second concerned the issue of the annulment of the privatisation. The Economic Court ordered the annulment of the contract of sale of shares, the return of 199,975 shares to the State and the return to the applicant company of the price paid for them, MDL 2,498,437.5. 15. The applicant company appealed against this judgment and argued, inter alia, that the Economic Court had on its own initiative come up with a solution for the Prosecutor General's problem with the time-limit. Furthermore, the applicant disagreed with this solution and argued that the time-limit should be calculated from the date when the shares were bought. It submitted that there were no impediments preventing the Prosecutor General from finding out about the problem of the carriages before the Court of Accounts had issued its decision in January 2004 and relied in this connection on the official commentary to the Civil Code. The applicant company also submitted that there had been no impediments to the Court of Accounts conducting its investigation earlier, and argued that accepting the Economic Court's line of thinking amounted to accepting that the Prosecutor's Office could challenge transactions concluded very many years ago by arguing that it had just found out about their illegality. The applicant company further submitted that the dispute was identical to that which ended with the judgment of the Supreme Court of 11 November 2004 and that the judge of the Economic Court who had examined the case had been influenced by the Government. 16. On 12 July 2007 the Supreme Court of Justice dismissed the applicant company's appeal and upheld the reasoning given by the lower-instance court. The judgment became final and an enforcement warrant was issued, under which the applicant company was obliged to transmit to the Government 199,875 shares in the quarry. 17. During the enforcement proceedings, the Government realised that in spite of the favourable outcome of the proceedings for them, they had not gained control over the quarry. Notably, they learned that in 2002 the quarry had issued 349,738 new shares as a result of the applicant company's adding new extraction equipment worth MDL 3,147,642 to its assets. The new shares were registered by the National Commission of Movable Assets on 20 May 2002. As a result, the ratio of the shares in the quarry's stock obtained by the Government after the proceedings had ended with the judgment of 12 July 2007 represented 30.59% and the applicant company maintained control over the quarry. 18. On 21 August 2007 the Prosecutor General's Office, on behalf of the Government, applied to the Economic Court for a supplementary judgment. It argued that the meaning of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice of 12 July 2007 had been to put the parties in the position they had been prior to February 2000, when the State held 65.86%. However, that was not possible because of the issue of new shares in 2002. Accordingly, the court was requested to annul the decision of the quarry's shareholder's meeting concerning the issue of 349,738 shares and the decision of the National Commission of Movable Values on 30 May 2002 concerning the registration of the new shares. 19. In its submissions to the Economic Court the applicant company argued that the Prosecutor General's Office, acting on behalf of the Government, had not requested the annulment of the issue of 349,738 shares in its initial court action. According to Article 250 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a supplementary judgment could be issued only if the court had omitted to rule in respect of a claim made by one of the parties to the proceedings. Since the Prosecutor's Office only sought the annulment of the sale of 199,875 shares, his new request could not be treated in a supplementary judgment. In any event, the issue of the new shares took place in 2002 and, therefore, the Prosecutor Office's action was time-barred. The approach taken by the court in respect of the time-limit in the main proceedings was inapplicable to the new request of the Prosecutor General's Office because the Court of Accounts did not refer to the problem of the issue of new shares in its judgment of 3 January 2004. Accordingly, the Prosecutor could not claim to have found out about that only in January 2004. 20. On 6 September 2007 the Economic Court upheld the Prosecutor General's action. Referring to the applicant company's objection that no claim about the annulment of the issue of new shares had been made during the proceedings which had ended on 12 July 2007 and that the new request could not be examined in a supplementary judgment, the court found that the claim was implicit in the Prosecutor General's Office's action, seeking that the State be reinstated in its right of ownership of 65.86% of the quarry's shares. According to the court, it was impossible to make such a reinstatement without annulling the shares issued in 2002. Since the court failed to rule on that problem, it was necessary to treat it in a supplementary judgment. The court ordered the annulment of the new shares arguing that otherwise the Government would own only 30.59% of the quarry's stock, a situation contrary to the judgment of 12 July 2007, where it was ordered that the Government be reinstated in its right of ownership of 65.86% of the shares. The court did not refer to the applicant company's objection based on the time-limit. 21. The applicant company appealed against the judgment and argued, inter alia, that in its initial action the Prosecutor General's Office had requested the annulment of the sale of the shares in 2000 but not the reinstatement of the State in its right of ownership of 65.86% of the quarry's shares. In support of this submission the applicant company cited parts of the Prosecutor General's application before the first-instance court. It argued that the Economic Court had misrepresented the prosecutor's claims. The applicant company also submitted that the first-instance court had failed to address its Statute of Limitations objection. 22. On 18 October 2007 the Supreme Court of Justice dismissed the applicant company's appeal. It found that since the sale of the shares of 2000 had been declared void, the parties had to be reinstated in their initial position, namely the position before the act of sale when the State owned 65.86% of the shares. Therefore, it was correct for the Economic Court to adopt a supplementary judgment clarifying the situation. 23. On 24 December 2007 the applicant company applied to the Economic Court and requested it to explain how the judgment of 6 September 2007 was to be enforced in terms of restitution of its contribution as a result of which the quarry had issued new shares in 2002 (see paragraph 17 above). 24. On 3 March 2008 the Economic Court issued a new judgment explaining that the applicant company was to be paid by the Government MDL 3,147,642, the value of the shares issued in 2002. The Government appealed against this judgment. 25. On 3 April 2008 the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the Government's appeal, quashed the judgment of 3 March 2008 and ordered a re-examination. 26. On 7 July 2008 the Economic Court re-examined the applicant company's request. It did not order that the value of the shares issued in 2002 be returned to the applicant but that the latter be returned the extracting equipment which had been added to the quarry's assets in 2002 (see paragraph 17 above). The applicant company appealed and argued that the solution given by the Economic Court was contrary to domestic legislation. However, the appeal was dismissed by the Supreme Court of Justice on 4 September 2008. 27. Since the mining equipment had been used and was useless to the applicant company, it has not been recovered by it from the quarry. 28. The relevant provisions of the Civil Code, in force at the relevant time, provide: The general limitation period for protection through a court action of the rights of a [natural] person is three years; it is one year for lawsuits between State organisations, collective farms and any other social organisations. The competent court ... shall apply the limitation period whether or not the parties request such application. The limitation period starts running from the day on which the right of action arises. The right of action arises on the day when a person comes to know or should have come to know that his right has been breached... Expiry of the limitation period prior to initiation of court proceedings constitutes a ground for rejecting the claim. If the competent court ... finds that the action has not commenced within the limitation period for well-founded reasons, the right in question shall be protected. The limitation period does not apply: ... (2) to claims by State organisations regarding restitution of State property found in the unlawful possession of ... other organisations ... and of citizens;”. 29. The relevant provisions of the new Civil Code, in force after 12 June 2003, read as follows: “(1) The civil law does not have a retroactive character. It cannot modify or suppress the conditions in which a prior legal situation was constituted or the conditions in which such a legal situation was extinguished. The new law cannot alter or abolish the already created effects of a legal situation which has been extinguished or is in the process of execution.” 30. In a judgment of 20 April 2005 (case nr. 2ra-563/05) the Supreme Court of Justice dismissed the plaintiff's contentions based on the provisions of the new Civil Code on the ground that the facts of the case related to a period before the entry into force of the new Civil Code and that, therefore, the provisions of the old Civil Code were applicable.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicants were born in 1947, 1973 and 1977 respectively. While the first applicant lives in Sarajevo, her sons, the second and the third applicants, live in Belgrade, in Serbia. 6. On 24 June 1983 the local authorities expropriated an apartment in Sarajevo which was occupied (but not owned) by the applicants. The local planning authorities were ordered to allocate the first applicant a suitable replacement apartment. This decision entered into force on 21 October 1983. 7. On 6 April 1987 the first applicant initiated court proceedings seeking the allocation to her by the local planning authorities of a suitable replacement apartment. 8. On 29 April 1998 the Sarajevo First Municipal Court held that, while it was clear that the local planning authorities were required to allocate the first applicant a suitable replacement apartment, the courts of law had no power to designate such an apartment. The Sarajevo First Municipal Court, consequently, declined jurisdiction. This decision entered into force on 31 March 1999 when the Sarajevo Cantonal Court upheld it. 9. On 24 November 1999 the first applicant complained to the Human Rights Chamber about non-enforcement of the administrative decision of 24 June 1983. 10. On 7 May 2003 the Human Rights Chamber found breaches of Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. It ordered the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (a constituent Entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina) to allocate, or to cause the local planning authorities to allocate, to the first applicant a suitable replacement apartment at the latest within one month. The Human Rights Chamber awarded the first applicant, in pecuniary damage, 18,200 convertible marks (BAM) (approximately 9,300 euros (EUR)) plus BAM 200 (approximately EUR 100) per month from June 2003 until the end of the month in which she was to be allocated a suitable replacement apartment. She was further awarded BAM 3,000 (approximately EUR 1,550) in respect of non-pecuniary damage. Lastly, she was awarded default interest on the above amounts at an annual rate of 10%. This decision entered into force on 4 September 2003. 11. On 24 March 2005 the local planning authorities offered the first applicant a tenancy of an apartment in Sarajevo. On 31 March 2005 the applicant rejected the offer. 12. On 1 July 2005 the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina paid the following amounts to the first applicant: BAM 18,200 in respect of pecuniary damage, BAM 3,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage and default interest on the above amounts at the rate indicated in the Human Rights Chamber’s decision. 13. On 15 September 2005 the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina requested the interpretation of the order to allocate, or to cause the local planning authorities to allocate, to the first applicant a suitable replacement apartment set out in the Human Rights Chamber’s decision. 14. On 15 December 2005 the legal successor of the Human Rights Chamber, the Human Rights Commission within the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, explained that in accordance with the Human Rights Chamber’s decision the first applicant should be given ownership of a suitable apartment and not only a tenancy. 15. On 19 September 2006 the local planning authorities offered the first applicant a tenancy of the same apartment as on 24 March 2005. The applicant has not accepted the offer. 16. On 8 November 2006 the first applicant filed a criminal complaint against the Government of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the Prosecutor’s Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina (non-enforcement of a final and enforceable decision of the Human Rights Chamber constitutes a criminal offence). It would appear that no decision has been taken in that regard. 17. On 13 March 2008 the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina paid an additional amount of BAM 10,069.76 to the first applicant in respect of pecuniary damage (that is, BAM 200 per month for the period from June 2003 until September 2006 plus default interest on those monthly amounts at the rate indicated in the Human Rights Chamber’s decision). 18. The relevant law and practice were outlined in Karanović v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (no. 39462/03, §§ 13-15, 20 November 2007) also concerning the non-enforcement of a Human Rights Chamber’s decision.","['6', 'P1']",['P1-1'],[],[],[],[],1
135,001-57771,ENG,GBR,CHAMBER,1992,CASE OF CAMPBELL v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,2,Violation of Art. 8;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses award - domestic proceedings;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings,John Freeland;R. Pekkanen,"8. On 10 October 1984 the applicant was convicted of assault and murder at the High Court, Glasgow, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. One of the offences involved setting fire to the front door of a flat thereby killing six of the nine members of one family asleep there at the time. A recommendation was made by the trial judge that he should serve not less that twenty years’ imprisonment in view, inter alia, of the appalling nature of the crimes and his previous criminal record which indicated that he was ""a ruthless man of violence"". Mr Campbell was initially classified as a Category B prisoner, the minimum classification for any prisoner either sentenced to three or more years’ imprisonment or convicted of a crime involving serious violence. Following an incident at Peterhead Prison he was charged with a number of offences and was re-classified as a Category A prisoner, the classification pertaining to the group of inmates requiring the highest degree of security. These charges were later abandoned by the Crown but he remained a Category A prisoner from 4 November 1985 until 9 March 1988. Since then he has been a Category B prisoner again. He has been detained in, inter alia, Perth and Peterhead Prisons which are situated at a considerable distance from the offices of his solicitor in Glasgow. He is now serving his sentence in the Special Unit in Barlinnie Prison, Glasgow. 9. Since his imprisonment the applicant had been advised by his solicitor in respect of: 1. an action for damages against the Secretary of State for Scotland for injuries sustained following an assault by a prison officer in Peterhead Prison on 3 November 1985; 2. an action for damages against the Secretary of State for Scotland in respect of an infestation of lice while in the hospital wing of Peterhead Prison in November 1985; 3. a potential claim against the Secretary of State for Scotland for damages in respect of an alleged assault by a prison officer during an incident in Barlinnie Prison on 25 April 1987; 4. a possible prosecution for an alleged assault on a prison officer arising out of the same incident; 5. a denial of communication with his solicitor following the said incident; 6. the denial of the applicant’s right to full and unrestricted correspondence between himself and his legal advisers on all of the above matters; 7. an application (application no. 12323/86) to the European Commission of Human Rights (""the Commission"") concerning inter alia his solitary confinement and access to his solicitor while in custody in hospital; and 8. the application with which the present case is concerned. 10. On 16 September 1985, the applicant’s solicitor wrote to the Governor of Peterhead Prison, asking that all correspondence between him and his client should pass without interference. After having discussed the matter with the applicant, the Deputy Governor wrote on 23 September 1985 to the applicant’s solicitor indicating that outgoing mail from the applicant to his solicitor concerning his petition to the Commission, if properly marked so as to indicate that it concerned the Convention, would not be opened. 11. In a further letter dated 4 October 1985 to the Governor of Peterhead Prison his solicitor claimed that the letter of 16 September had not been answered in its entirety as he had been given no assurance by the Deputy Governor that letters to Mr Campbell would not be subject to interference. On 15 October 1985 the Deputy Governor replied that incoming mail from solicitors concerning an application to the Commission, suitably identified by placing (a) the name of the solicitor’s firm and (b) the initials ECHR in a prominent position on the envelope, would be opened in the presence of the prisoner and handed to him unread (see paragraph 25 below). The Deputy Governor explained that this arrangement would not apply to solicitors’ correspondence about matters other than the application to the Commission. 12. On 24 October 1985 the applicant’s solicitor wrote to the Scottish Home and Health Department (""SHHD""), the Government department concerned with the administration of prisons in Scotland, again requesting that all of his correspondence to the applicant should be allowed to pass to him without interference. 13. On 29 October 1985 the applicant petitioned the Secretary of State for Scotland complaining about censorship of his correspondence with his solicitor. In their reply of 19 June 1986 to this and other petitions the SHHD advised the applicant that his solicitors had been informed by the Deputy Governor, Peterhead, on 15 October 1985 that correspondence ""in respect of ECHR procedures"" should be clearly marked to ensure privacy but that any other correspondence between an inmate and his legal advisers was subject to scrutiny under standing instructions to prison establishments. 14. On 16 June 1986 the SHHD wrote to the applicant’s solicitor confirming the arrangements for solicitors’ correspondence concerning matters before the Commission but reaffirming that other correspondence was still subject to the normal rules which provided for the opening and reading of all letters to and from a prisoner (see paragraphs 19-22 below). 15. On 19 June 1986 the applicant again complained that incoming mail from his solicitor was scrutinised. He repeated these complaints on 27 June 1986. In these petitions, the applicant also drew the attention of the authorities to the fact that correspondence to and from the European Commission of Human Rights was being opened. The reply from the SHHD, received by the applicant on 15 July 1986, referred to the existing arrangements as discussed in correspondence between his solicitor and management at Peterhead Prison in September and October 1985. In a petition dated 4 November 1986, the applicant again complained that all legal correspondence apart from letters relating to the Convention was being opened. The reply to this petition and others received by him on 24 July 1987 stated, inter alia, that his correspondence was being dealt with in accordance with Prison Standing Orders. However, he was advised that the terms of the existing Standing Orders were under review in this respect. In a further petition dated 30 December 1986 he complained that a letter from a firm of solicitors was opened and photocopied before he received it. 16. In a letter dated 16 June 1987 to the applicant’s solicitor, the SHHD confirmed that the rules relating to prisoners’ correspondence were under review in the light of the friendly settlement reached in the case of McComb (application no. 10621/83, report of the Commission dated 15 May 1986 - see paragraph 23 below). The applicant’s solicitor was advised that, pending the outcome of discussions between the SHHD and the Law Society of Scotland, the current rules would continue to apply to correspondence between a prisoner and his legal adviser; in particular, only correspondence concerning matters before the Commission would be allowed to pass unopened. However, it is established that at least some of the correspondence from the Commission had been opened. The applicant referred to letters dated 20 June 1985, 17 July 1985, 9 October 1985, 20 November 1985, 22 April 1986, 22 May 1986, 7 January 1987, 4 June 1987, 18 August 1987, 2 October 1987, 7 October 1987 and 3 November 1987 from the Commission which allegedly show the prison censor’s mark on the top right hand corner. The Government accepted that five of these letters (17 July 1985, 9 October 1985, 20 November 1985, 22 April 1986 and 18 August 1987) were opened. They considered that three other letters (20 June 1985, 22 May 1986 and 7 January 1987) may have been opened but that it was not possible to identify the markings. Of the remaining letters the Government stated that there were no identifiable marks and thus no opinion could be expressed as to whether they had been opened or not. 17. The applicant’s solicitor applied for legal aid to bring civil proceedings in respect of the interference with the applicant’s correspondence. Legal aid was refused on 7 October 1986 by the Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee on the ground that the applicant had no probable cause of action. The Committee also noted that the applicant was not being denied visits from his legal advisers and that he had not indicated that he was unable to give instructions verbally to his advisers. The applicant’s appeal against this decision was refused on 5 December 1986 by the Legal Aid Central Committee of the Law Society of Scotland. 18. At the relevant time the prison system in Scotland was governed by the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1952 (""the 1952 Act""), which has since been repealed. Similar provisions were re-enacted in the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1989. Sections 1 and 3 of the 1952 Act vested general control and superintendence over prisons in Scotland in the Secretary of State for Scotland. He was empowered, by section 35 (1), to ""make [by statutory instrument] rules for the regulation and management of prisons ... and for the classification, treatment, employment, discipline and control of persons required to be detained therein"". In exercise of his powers under section 35 (1), the Secretary of State made the Prison (Scotland) Rules 1952 (""the Prison Rules""), which have been amended from time to time and which are published. He also, in supplement of the Prison Rules and by virtue of his general jurisdiction over prisons and of various powers conferred by the Prison Rules themselves, issues instructions to the Governors of prisons in the form of Standing Orders and administrative circulars. The Standing Orders relevant to correspondence are also published. Every prisoner, on his admission to prison, is given or given access to a booklet summarising the Rules and Standing Orders. 19. Communications between prisoners and their legal advisers and others are governed principally by Rule 74 of the rules. Rule 74 (4) provides that - subject to one exception which is not relevant in the present case - ""every letter to or from a prisoner shall be read by the Governor or by an officer deputed by him for that purpose"". The validity of Rule 74 (4) was judicially considered and upheld in the case of Leech v. Secretary of State for Scotland (judgment of the Outer House of the Court of Session of 26 October 1990) which concerned the reading of a prisoner’s correspondence with a legal adviser relating to potential legal proceedings. The Court considered inter alia that Rule 74 (4) could not be described as irrational since ""it cannot be supposed that there are no sound grounds for requiring control over correspondence involving a prisoner even when it takes place between him and his legal adviser"". 20. In the case of remand prisoners, Rule 124 (2) provides that they shall be allowed to write to their legal advisers. Under Rule 124 (3) any confidential written communications prepared by such a prisoner as instructions for his legal adviser may be delivered to the legal adviser without being examined by any officer of the prison unless the Governor has reason to suppose that it contains matters not relating to such instructions. Under Rule 127 this facility is also available to convicted prisoners who are the subject of further charges. Similar provisions apply under Rule 132 (2) to an appellant in connection with his appeal. 21. These rules are supplemented by Standing Order M, which deals in detail with communications between prisoners and others. Copies of this Standing Order are available to prisoners and the public. Standing Order Ma1 (a) sets out the purpose of examination of the correspondence, namely to prevent its use to plan escapes or disturbances or otherwise jeopardise the security of the establishment and to satisfy other reasonable requirements of prison administration. Under Standing Order Ma1 (d), when correspondence is examined or read this is to be done as quickly as possible. 22. Most correspondence with legal advisers is governed by Standing Order Ma6 (e) which concerns general correspondence. Under Standing Order Ma7 such correspondence: ""may not contain the following: (a) Escape plans, or material which if allowed would jeopardise the security of a prison establishment. (b) Plans or material which would tend to assist or encourage the commission of any disciplinary offence or criminal offence (including attempts to defeat the ends of justice by suggesting the concoction or suppression of evidence). (c) Material which could jeopardise national security. (d) Descriptions of the making of any weapon, explosive, poison or other destructive device. (e) Obscure or coded messages which are not readily intelligible or decipherable. (f) Threats of violence or of damage to property likely to induce fear in the recipient. (g) Blackmail or extortion. (h) Indecent or obscene material. (i) Information which would create a clear threat or present danger of violence or physical harm to any person. (j) Complaints about prison treatment which the inmate has not yet raised through the prescribed procedures ... (k) Material which is intended for publication or for use by radio or television (or which, if sent, would be likely to be published or broadcast) ... (l) Material constituting the conduct of business activity ... (m) In the case of an inmate against whom a deportation order is in force, material constituting or arranging any financial transaction ... (n) In the case of an inmate in respect of whom a receiving order has been made or who is an undischarged bankrupt, material constituting or arranging any financial transaction ..."" 23. Following the friendly settlement of 15 May 1986 in the case of McComb v. the United Kingdom (application no. 10621/83, report of the Commission, Decisions and Reports (DR) no. 50, pp. 81-89), new procedures dealing with correspondence between a prisoner and his legal adviser in respect of legal proceedings which have been instituted came into force on 21 March 1988, as set out in Standing Order Ma8: ""Correspondence with a legal adviser about legal proceedings to which an inmate is already a party or, about a forthcoming adjudication, may not be read or stopped unless the Governor has reason to suppose it contains other material. Such a letter may be examined for illicit enclosures, but should only be opened for that purpose in the presence of the inmate by whom it is sent or to whom it is addressed. Other correspondence with a legal adviser may be read and may not contain anything specified in Standing Order Ma7 (a) to (i) and (k) to (n). Such correspondence may not be stopped on the grounds that it contains material prohibited by Standing Order Ma7 (j) unless it is clear that the inmate is not seeking legal advice but is writing for some other purpose."" The procedure to be followed in respect of such correspondence was described in a Circular issued to Prison Governors on 26 February 1988. The solicitor is required to send such mail within a sealed envelope bearing the words ""Legal Proceedings"" and his signature. This envelope is placed within another envelope addressed to the Prison Governor. The inner envelope is passed unopened to the prisoner. When a prisoner is not yet a party to legal proceedings, but is contemplating bringing them, all mail is liable to be opened and read. In practice, mail is not opened at low-security ""open prisons"" or at the very high-security ""Special Units"". In other prisons the letters of prisoners in high-risk categories are those most frequently opened. 24. Standing Order M also contains specific provisions relating to correspondence with the European Commission or Court of Human Rights or with a legal adviser in connection with a petition to the Commission or pending proceedings before the Commission or the Court. Under Standing Order Ma10 such correspondence may not contain material prohibited under Standing Order Ma7 (a) to (c) or (e) (see paragraph 22 above). 25. Further general provisions relating to the Convention are to be found in Standing Orders Ma1 (b) and Mf. In particular, Standing Order Mf7 expressly provides that correspondence between an inmate and his legal adviser about a petition to the Commission or proceedings resulting therefrom should not be read unless the Governor has reason to suppose that the correspondence contains other matters. 26. The Government state that, in practice, as regards correspondence between prisoners and the Commission, outgoing letters if sealed will normally go unopened. Incoming letters from the Commission are opened; the contents are examined to confirm that they are what they purport to be but they are not read; they are thereafter issued promptly to the prisoner.",['8'],[],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1979 and lives in Moscow. 8. On 29 October 1998 Ms T., an undercover police agent, called the applicant and said that she wished to buy a dose of heroin. The applicant agreed to procure it and, accompanied by Mr M., met Ms T. in the street. Ms T. handed the applicant banknotes, given to her by police officers S. and R. and marked with a special substance (which was visible only under ultra-violet light). The applicant took the money and went to the house of another person, Mr G. The latter gave the applicant a sachet containing 0.05 grams of heroin. On his return to the meeting place with the purported buyer, the applicant was apprehended by the police officers, who had waited for him in the street. 9. The applicant was brought to the local police station where his fingers were examined under ultraviolet light: they bore traces of the substance used by the police to mark the banknotes. Ms T., in the presence of two attesting witnesses, handed the sachet to the police officers, explaining that she had received it from the applicant. The sachet was placed in a container, which was sealed, signed by the attesting witnesses and sent for forensic examination. The applicant was placed overnight in the police station’s detention facility. 10. On 30 October 1998 a criminal case was opened and the applicant was charged with drug trafficking. On the same day the prosecutor of the North-Eastern District of Moscow, referring to the circumstances of the applicant’s apprehension, the gravity of the charges against him and the risk of absconding, ordered that he be placed in detention on remand. The applicant was transferred to pre-trial detention facility no. 48/1, Moscow. 11. The pre-trial investigation was completed and on 24 December 1998 the case file with the bill of indictment was referred to the Moscow Butyrskiy District Court for trial. On 29 December 1998 an application for release, pending before the Preobrazhenskiy District Court, was forwarded to the Butyrskiy District Court on the ground that the bill of indictment had been transferred to that court and that it should therefore deal with all aspects of the applicant’s case. The applicant’s lawyer appealed against this decision, but on 3 February 1999 the Moscow City Court dismissed the appeal. 12. At a preparatory hearing on 13 January 1999 the court ruled that the applicant should remain in custody pending trial, without giving any reasons for that decision. 13. On 18 February 1999 the applicant’s father filed a fresh application for release with a court, claiming that the applicant’s very poor state of health was incompatible with his detention conditions and, in particular, with the level of medical assistance available in the pre-trial detention centre. 14. On 17 March 1999 the court extended the applicant’s detention pending trial. No reasons for that decision were adduced. 15. On 21 April 1999 the applicant’s father filed a new application for release with the district court, referring again to his son’s health problems. According to the applicant’s submissions, the defence repeated this request on 26 and 27 July 1999. The Government claimed that the motion dated 27 July 1999 was received by the court only on 2 August 1999. 16. On 27 July 1999 the court decided that a fresh examination of the applicant’s mental health was required. It adjourned the case and decided that the applicant should remain in prison in the meantime. No reasons were given for that decision. 17. On 30 July 1999 the applicant’s lawyer appealed against the trial court’s ruling of 27 July 1999. He challenged the trial court’s decisions to adjourn the case and to order a fresh examination of the applicant’s mental health, which had the effect of prolonging the applicant’s detention in the difficult conditions of the detention facility. He made the following request: “Under Article 331 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, I [hereby] request the [Moscow City] Court to quash the decision of the Butyrskiy District Court concerning adjournment of the case against V.V. Khudobin, the appointment of an additional psychiatric examination [of the applicant] and the refusal [to grant] his application for release.” The appeal was addressed to the Moscow City Court and, as required by domestic law, was sent through the registry of the trial court. The registry received the appeal on 4 August 1999. However, it appears that it was never forwarded to the appellate court for examination. 18. On 17 August 1999 the applicant’s legal representatives filed a similar appeal, which was received by the registry on the following day. On 1 September 1999 the applicant’s lawyer sent a letter to the trial court in which he sought an explanation as to what had happened to his appeal of 30 July 1999. He received no reply to this letter. 19. On 15 September 1999 the applicant’s parents complained to a deputy president of the Moscow City Court and to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation about the applicant’s continued detention. The materials of the case file do not contain any reply to these appeals. 20. On 17 September 1999 the applicant’s representative requested the trial court to release the applicant. The defence again referred to the deterioration in the applicant’s health and, in particular, to the repetitive pneumonias the applicant had contracted in the previous three months. 21. The applicant remained in detention until 11 November 1999, when the court discontinued the criminal proceedings (see below) and released him. 22. Since 1995-1997 the applicant has suffered from many chronic diseases, such as epilepsy, pancreatitis, chronic viral hepatitis B and C and various mental deficiencies. The doctors who examined the applicant in 1995 recommended out-patient psychiatric supervision and treatment by anticonvulsants. It appears that by the time of his arrest in October 1998 the applicant had a certain history of drug use, including intravenous heroin use. 23. Immediately after his transfer to the detention centre on 30 October 1998 the applicant was subjected to a comprehensive medical examination, including an HIV test, a drug test and psychiatric examination. The drug test revealed that the applicant was intoxicated with morphine. A panel of psychiatrists confirmed the previous diagnoses but found him legally capable of being held accountable for the alleged offences. On 10 November 1998 the first results of the applicant’s blood test were received. According to the report by the forensic laboratory, the applicant was HIV-positive. 24. On 30 November 1998 a psychiatrist re-examined the applicant and found him to be capable of being held legally accountable. On an unspecified date in December 1998 the facility administration received the applicant’s medical records for the period prior to his arrest, in which the necessary treatment was indicated. In particular, the applicant was prescribed anticonvulsants (финлепсин, конвулекс) and anti-hepatitis therapy (рибоксин, парсил). 25. On 23 December 1998 the applicant underwent a new medical examination, which confirmed the previous diagnoses and stated that the applicant “was able to participate in the trial and take part in investigative actions”. 26. While in detention, the applicant suffered from acute pneumonia, epileptic seizures, bronchitis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, and other serious diseases. Owing to his ailments the applicant was on many occasions placed in the unit for contagious patients in the pre-trial detention centre’s hospital. As reported by the detention facility’s administration, the applicant was in the centre’s hospital from 24 December 1998 to 22 March 1999, from 20 April to 18 May 1999, from 19 July to 12 August 1999 and from 17 to 28 September 1999. 27. On many occasions the defence informed the court, the administration of the detention facility and other State authorities about the applicant’s serious health problems. Thus, on 18 January 1999 the defence requested a thorough medical examination of the applicant. On 22 January 1999 the applicant’s father asked the facility administration to order a fresh examination of the applicant by an independent doctor, hired by the defence. However, the facility administration refused this request. 28. During the trial the applicant underwent three psychiatric examinations. On 15 June 1999 the doctors concluded that the applicant had been legally insane when committing the incriminated acts. The report stated, in particular, that the applicant “suffered from a chronic mental disease in the form of epilepsy with polymorphous seizures and comparable psychic problems and with evident psychic modifications, with a tendency to drug use”. The report of 19 October 1999 confirmed that the applicant was legally insane and needed compulsory treatment. 29. At about 10.40 p.m. on 26 April 1999 the applicant had an epileptic seizure. As follows from a written statement signed by his cell-mates, they had to unclench the applicant’s teeth with a wooden spoon in order to prevent him from suffocating. The paramedic on duty then arrived and gave the applicant’s cell-mates a syringe containing an unknown substance, which they injected in the applicant’s buttocks. The applicant’s father complained about this fact to the facility administration, which replied that the applicant had received medical aid “in the room for medical procedures”. 30. In May 1999 the applicant contracted measles and pneumonia. On 26 June 1999 he had another epileptic seizure. He was transferred to the detention centre’s psychiatric facility, where he remained for some time under out-patient supervision and received anticonvulsants. In his letter of 2 August 1999 to the Ombudsman, the applicant’s father indicated that on 6 July 1999 the applicant had had another epileptic seizure but had received no medical assistance. 31. On 15 July 1999 the applicant fell ill with bronchopneumonia. According to the applicant’s father, facility doctors began treatment only ten days after the symptoms had appeared. 32. On 17 July 1999 the applicant was administered a blood test in the facility hospital against his will. His father complained to the facility administration. The administration replied, by letter of 16 August 1999, that the blood sample had been taken using a disposable needle. 33. On 21 July 1999 the applicant’s father complained to the Ministry of Justice about his son’s conditions of detention and the lack of appropriate medical treatment. On 27 July 1999 he filed a similar complaint to the Butyrskiy District Court, also seeking the applicant’s release. According to the applicant’s father, the applicant was repeatedly transferred from one cell to another, in spite of a high temperature (40 C˚) and fever, and did not receive adequate treatment for pneumonia. He spent three days in a cell with purulent patients and slept on the floor on account of a shortage of sleeping places. The facility doctors did not establish the applicant’s immunological and biochemical status, or the possible causes of his persistent fever. The applicant’s father wanted to deliver a multi-vitamin medicine to him but the facility administration refused to accept it. 34. The court dismissed the application for release. On the same day, on a motion by the prosecutor, the court ordered a new expert examination of the applicant’s mental health on the ground that the previous one, while recognising the applicant as legally insane, did not specify whether his state of mental health required compulsory medical treatment. 35. In August 1999 the applicant’s mother complained to the Ministry of Justice about the applicant’s conditions of detention and, specifically, about the lack of adequate medical assistance. 36. According to the Government, from 20 April to 18 May 1999 the applicant underwent in-patient medical treatment in the detention facility’s hospital. He was supervised by a “doctor in charge” and received “total restorative treatment and vitamin therapy”. Cell no. 735, where the applicant was detained, was equipped with six berths, a lavatory, hot and cold water taps and ventilation. The applicant was provided with bedding, tin ware, meals three times a day and items for personal hygiene. The number of detainees never exceeded the number of berths. 37. The Government confirmed that on 26 April 1999, at about 10:40 p.m., the applicant had had a seizure. Immediately thereafter he was examined by a doctor, who took the applicant’s pulse, sounded his heart, measured his blood pressure, palpated the abdomen and administered an intramuscular shot of aminazine. On the following day the applicant underwent further medical examination. 38. The applicant was discharged from hospital in a satisfactory state of health. On 26 June 1999 the applicant was placed in cell no. 353, in the prison hospital’s psychiatric department. He was supervised by a doctor and received “preventive medical assistance”. This cell was also properly equipped and was not overcrowded. 39. According to a certificate dated 23 April 2004 from the deputy head of the medical department, the applicant had no epileptic seizures during his stay in the psychiatric department of the prison hospital. In the psychiatric hospital anticonvulsant treatment was administered. 40. The Government produced copies of three medical certificates, dated 29 January, 25 February and 27 April 1999. They contained the following relevant entries. 41. The first certificate stated that the applicant was HIV-positive, suffered from epilepsy and had had one epileptic seizure during his stay in the facility hospital. His state of health was assessed as “satisfactory”. Any additional medical examinations were to be ordered by the investigative authorities. 42. The second certificate of 25 February 1999 stated that the applicant was HIV-positive and was suffering from chronic hepatitis B and C and from epilepsy. Further, there was no record of any epileptic seizure from 30 to 31 October 1998. On 18 February 1999 the applicant consulted a psychiatrist and a neurologist. He was discharged from hospital at the prosecuting authorities’ request in a “satisfactory” condition, which did not prevent him from participating in the proceedings. 43. The third certificate of 27 April 1999 indicated that the applicant was HIV-positive and was suffering from measles and epilepsy. It further stated that “at the present moment the [applicant’s] state of health is relatively satisfactory” and that the applicant would be fit to participate in the proceedings in May 1999. 44. The Government also produced a collection of documents which appeared to be extracts from the applicant’s medical record. Most pages were illegible. The legible pages listed the applicant’s diagnoses but contained no information about the nature of treatment administered to the applicant in the detention facility’s hospital. 45. On 30 December 1998 the Butyrskiy District Court received the case-file from the prosecutor. The first preparatory hearing took place on 13 January 1999. In the following months the court held several hearings where various procedural matters were decided upon. Thus, on 17 March 1999 the court commissioned a fresh expert examination of the applicant’s mental health and adjourned the case. The expert report was ready by 15 June 1999; it found that the applicant was insane but did not contain any recommendations as to possible compulsory medical treatment. On 27 July 1999 the court commissioned another psychiatric examination of the applicant and adjourned the examination of the case. 46. The first hearing on the merits took place on 11 November 1999 in the presence of the applicant’s lawyer. The applicant was not present. At the lawyer’s request, the court admitted several persons to participate in the proceedings as the applicant’s representatives, including Ms Kostromina. They were given thirty minutes to read the case file. The applicant’s lawyer asked for an adjournment because several witnesses, including G., who had sold heroin to the applicant, and S. and R., the policemen involved in the operation, had failed to appear. However, the court decided to proceed. 47. The defence team’s arguments before the trial court can be summarised as follows. The defence contended that applicant had been incited to commit an offence by Ms T., acting on behalf of the police. According to the defence, Russian law prohibited any form of incitement or provocation; only if a specific crime was being prepared could an undercover operation be carried out. In the present case, however, the police had no proof of the applicant’s involvement in drug trafficking when planning the “test buy”. 48. They further stressed that the applicant’s confession had been given in a state of drug intoxication and without legal advice. Finally, the defence challenged the credibility of the forensic examination report which identified the substance confiscated and allegedly sold by the applicant to Ms T. as heroin. They referred to a declaration signed by the applicant on 15 October 1999, stating that the confession had been extracted from him by force. 49. At the hearing on 11 November 1999 Ms T. gave evidence against the applicant. She testified that she had helped the police voluntarily. She explained that she had handed the applicant over to the police “out of kindness in a manner of speaking” (так сказать, по доброте душевной) [sic]. She also stated as follows: “At that time I did not know where to get heroin, so I called [the applicant] because in the past he had already procured it for me”. 50. The court also heard Mr M., who was with the applicant at the moment of his arrest and who confirmed, in principle, Ms T.’s account of the facts. However, he said that before the events at issue he had procured drugs for himself from another source. Finally, the court interviewed the applicant’s mother, who described her son’s character. She testified that she did not know when her son had started to take drugs. 51. The District Court examined the documents, exhibits and expert reports contained in the case file. In particular, it examined the police report describing the “test buy” and the findings of the psychiatric examination. 52. On the same day the Butyrskiy District Court found the applicant guilty of selling heroin to Ms T. on 28 October 1998. It also ruled, referring to the psychiatric report of 19 October 1999, that the applicant had committed the crime in a state of insanity and could not therefore be held criminally accountable. The court discontinued the criminal proceedings and ordered compulsory medical treatment of the applicant at his home. The applicant was released from custody. 53. The applicant’s representative appealed, claiming that the applicant was not guilty and maintaining, inter alia, that the police had fabricated the crime. In particular, there was no reliable evidence that the applicant had already been suspected by the police of being a drug-dealer at the moment of his arrest. Moreover, the applicant had derived no financial benefit from the transaction as he had given Mr G. all the money that he had received from T. for the sachet. Furthermore, the court failed to interview several key witnesses, including the two police officers who had arrested the applicant, two eye-witnesses to his arrest and Mr G., who had sold the substance to the applicant. Finally, the applicant’s representatives claimed that the confession had been extracted from the applicant by force. 54. On 11 January 2000 the Moscow City Court dismissed the appeal. The applicant was absent but his lawyer and representatives took part in the appeal proceedings. 55. On 12 April 2004 the Butyrskiy District Court of Moscow, on a motion by psychoneurotic hospital no. 19, Moscow, ordered that the applicant’s compulsory medical treatment be discontinued. 56. The relevant extracts from the 3rd General Report [CPT/Inf (93) 12] by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“the CPT”) read as follows: ... 35. A prison’s health care service should at least be able to provide regular out-patient consultations and emergency treatment (of course, in addition there may often be a hospital-type unit with beds). ... Further, prison doctors should be able to call upon the services of specialists. ... Out-patient treatment should be supervised, as appropriate, by health care staff; in many cases it is not sufficient for the provision of follow-up care to depend upon the initiative being taken by the prisoner. 36. The direct support of a fully-equipped hospital service should be available, in either a civil or prison hospital. ... 37. Whenever prisoners need to be hospitalised or examined by a specialist in a hospital, they should be transported with the promptness and in the manner required by their state of health.” 38. A prison health care service should be able to provide medical treatment and nursing care, as well as appropriate diets, physiotherapy, rehabilitation or any other necessary special facility, in conditions comparable to those enjoyed by patients in the outside community. Provision in terms of medical, nursing and technical staff, as well as premises, installations and equipment, should be geared accordingly. There should be appropriate supervision of the pharmacy and of the distribution of medicines. Further, the preparation of medicines should always be entrusted to qualified staff (pharmacist/nurse, etc.). 39. A medical file should be compiled for each patient, containing diagnostic information as well as an ongoing record of the patient’s evolution and of any special examinations he has undergone. In the event of a transfer, the file should be forwarded to the doctors in the receiving establishment. Further, daily registers should be kept by health care teams, in which particular incidents relating to the patients should be mentioned. Such registers are useful in that they provide an overall view of the health care situation in the prison, at the same time as highlighting specific problems which may arise. 40. The smooth operation of a health care service presupposes that doctors and nursing staff are able to meet regularly and to form a working team under the authority of a senior doctor in charge of the service.” 57. Article 228 § 1 of the Criminal Code punishes the unlawful procurement of drugs without an intent to supply. Article 228 § 4 punishes the unlawful supply of drugs in large quantities. 58. Pursuant to Article 21 (“Insanity”) of the Criminal Code, a person who was insane at the time of committing a socially dangerous act as a result of chronic or temporary mental derangement, mental deficiency or any other mental condition shall not be subject to criminal liability. In such cases the court, by an interim decision (определение), discontinues the proceedings and discharges the defendant from criminal liability or penalty, and may order that the defendant undergo compulsory medical treatment (Article 410 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). However, if the court finds that there is insufficient indication of the defendant’s guilt, the proceedings should be discontinued on that ground. The court may in this case still prescribe compulsory medical treatment. 59. Article 6 of the Operational Search Activities Act of 5 July 1995, with further amendments, lists a number of intrusive techniques which may be used by law enforcement or security authorities for the purpose of investigating crimes. Under Article 6 § 1 (4) of the Act, the police may carry out a “test buy” (проверочная закупка) of prohibited goods (such as drugs). 60. According to Article 7 § 2-1 of the Act, in order to initiate a “test buy” the police should have certain preliminary information that a crime is being planned or that it has been already committed. A test buy is initiated by a written order from the head of the relevant police unit. Judicial control is provided if the “test buy” involves interference with the home, correspondence and other constitutionally protected rights. The formal requirement is completion of a “protocol”, in which the results of the test buy are determined. This “protocol” can be used as evidence in the criminal proceedings. The Act contains other possible situations in which a “test buy” can be carried out (such as where a criminal investigation has been started, where a request for a “test buy” was received from the judicial or prosecution authorities, etc.); however, these are not relevant to the present case. 61. The “old” Code of Criminal Procedure (CCrP, in force until 2002), provided for a number of interim measures warranting the defendant’s appearance at the trial and proper administration of justice. Those “preventive measures” or “measures of restraint” (меры пресечения) include an undertaking not to leave a town or region, personal security, bail or detention on remand (Article 89 of the old CCrP). 62. Under the old CCrP, a decision ordering detention on remand could be taken by a prosecutor or a court (Articles 11, 89 and 96). When deciding whether to remand an accused in custody, the competent authority was required to consider whether there were “sufficient grounds to believe” that he or she would abscond during the investigation or trial or obstruct the establishment of the truth or re-offend (Article 89 of the old CCrP). 63. Before 14 March 2001, detention on remand was authorised if the accused was charged with a criminal offence carrying a sentence of at least one year’s imprisonment or if there were “exceptional circumstances” in the case (Article 96). Under the old Code the competent authority also had to take into account the gravity of the charge, information on the accused person’s character, his or her profession, age, state of health, family status and other circumstances (Article 91 of the old CCrP). 64. The Code distinguished between two types of detention on remand: the first being “during the investigation”, that is while a competent agency – the police or a prosecutor’s office – investigated the case, and the second “before the court” (or “during the judicial investigations”), that is, while the case was before a court. Although there was no difference in practice between them (the detainee was held in the same detention facility), the calculation of the time-limits was different. 65. After arrest the suspect is placed in custody “during the investigation”. The maximum permitted period of detention “during the investigation” is two months but it can be extended for up to eighteen months in “exceptional circumstances”. Extensions are authorised by prosecutors of ascending hierarchical levels, subject to an appeal to the court. No extension of detention “during the investigation” beyond eighteen months is possible (Article 97 of the old CCrP). The period of detention “during the investigation” was calculated to the day when the prosecutor sent the case to the trial court (Article 97 of the old CCrP). 66. From the date the prosecutor forwards the case to the trial court, the defendant’s detention is “before the court” (or “during the judicial proceedings”). Before 14 March 2001 the old CCrP set no time-limit for detention “during the judicial proceedings”. The duration of the trial was not limited in time (although the judge had to start the trial within a certain time after receiving the case file from the prosecution). 67. The detainee or his or her counsel or representative can challenge the detention order issued by a prosecutor, and any subsequent extension order, before a court. The judge is required to review the lawfulness of and justification for a detention or extension order no later than three days after receipt of the relevant papers. The judge can either dismiss the challenge or revoke the pre-trial detention and order the detainee’s release (Article 220-1 and -2). 68. An appeal to a higher court lay against the judge’s decision. It has to be examined within the same time-limit as appeals against a judgment on the merits (Article 331 in fine). 69. On receipt of the case file, the judge had to determine, in particular, whether the defendant should remain in custody or be released pending trial (Articles 222 § 5 and 230 of the old CCrP) and rule on any application by the defendant for release (Article 223 of the old CCrP). If the application was refused, a fresh application could be made once the trial has commenced (Article 223 of the old CCrP). At any time during the trial the court could order, vary or revoke any preventive measure, including detention on remand (Article 260 of the old CCrP). 70. An appeal against such a decision lay to the higher court. It had to be lodged within ten days and examined within the same time-limit as an appeal against the judgment on the merits (Article 331 of the old CCrP). 71. Legal representation of a client in court proceedings is usually governed by the rules of commission or agency contracts (Chapters 49 and 52 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation). In addition, Chapter 50 of the Code provides for the agency of necessity: a person may act in the interests of another in order to prevent damage to the latter’s property, protect or promote his lawful interests, etc. If the actions of a person acting in another’s interest without proper mandate are approved by the beneficiary of such acts, this is regarded as an agency agreement between them (Article 982 of the Civil Code). Consequently, the beneficiary should bear the agent’s reasonable costs (Article 984 of the Civil Code).","['3', '5', '6']","['5-3', '5-4', '6-1']",[],[],[],[],1

THE NETHERLANDS,2,Violation of Art. 3 with regard to the first applicant;No violation of Art. 3 with regard to the other applicants;No violation of Art. 8;No violation of Art. 13;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings,Elisabeth Palm;Gaukur Jörundsson,"9. The first applicant is Mr Jacobus Lorsé, who was born in 1945. The second applicant, Mrs Everdina Lorsé-Quint (born in 1961), is the wife of the first applicant. The third, fourth and fifth applicants, Pieternella Johanna Lorsé (born in 1985), Paula Martina Lorsé (born in 1987) and Jacobus Lorsé junior (born in 1992), are the children of the first and second applicants. The sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth applicants, Maria Petronella van Esch (born in 1965), Johanna Maria Lorsé (born in 1966), Neeltje Maria Lorsé (born in 1968) and Hubertus Joseph Lorsé (born in 1970), are children of the first applicant born out of previous relationships. The first applicant is currently serving a prison sentence in Dordrecht. The other applicants are all resident in Maastricht, with the exception of the ninth applicant who resides in Rotterdam. 10. The first applicant, hereinafter referred to as Mr Lorsé, was taken into police custody (in verzekering gesteld) on 24 July 1994 and subsequently placed in detention on remand (voorlopige hechtenis). He was initially detained in ordinary remand institutions (huizen van bewaring). 11. Mr Lorsé was convicted of drugs and firearms offences. He was sentenced at first instance to twelve years’ imprisonment and a fine of one million Netherlands guilders (NLG). On appeal the prison term was increased to fifteen years’ imprisonment, the fine remaining the same. His conviction and sentence became final on 30 June 1998 when his appeal on points of law was rejected by the Supreme Court (Hoge Raad). He is now serving that sentence. He will be eligible for provisional release no sooner than July 2004. It would appear that he has been sentenced in Belgium to a six-year prison sentence for drugs-related crimes but that the proceedings there are still pending. 12. On 14 September 1994, while the criminal proceedings were still pending, Mr Lorsé handed his counsel a letter from the prison authorities from which it appeared that it was intended to place him (Mr Lorsé) in an extra security institution. On 27 September 1994 Mr Lorsé was transferred to the Temporary Extra Security Institution (Tijdelijke Extra Beveiligde Inrichting, “TEBI”), part of the Nieuw Vosseveld Penitentiary Complex in Vught. 13. By a letter of 28 September 1994 the Minister of Justice informed Mr Lorsé that apart from the fact that he was suspected of very serious crimes, official information (ambtsberichten) was available from which it appeared that he was likely to use violence in an attempt to escape. Reference was made to the fact that he had already once managed to avoid being arrested, endangering human life in so doing. Reference was also made to the prison sentence awaiting him in Belgium. In these circumstances it was considered that public order would be severely affected should Mr Lorsé manage to escape. 14. Mr Lorsé was subsequently notified, by letters couched in similar terms and dated 21 November 1995, 29 May 1996, 5 December 1996, 16 June 1997, 9 December 1997, 19 June 1998 and 21 January 1999, of the prolongation of his detention in the TEBI and – following the rejection of his appeal on points of law on 30 June 1998 – in the Extra Security Institution (Extra Beveiligde Inrichting, “EBI”). 15. On a number of occasions Mr Lorsé made use of legal remedies to protest against his placement, and the prolongation of that placement, in the EBI. On 1 February 1999, for example, Mr Lorsé, through his counsel, lodged an appeal to the Appeals Board (beroepscommissie) of the Central Council for the Administration of Criminal Justice (Centrale Raad voor Strafrechtstoepassing) against the decision of 21 January 1999 to prolong his placement. In addition to stating that there was no factual justification for his continued detention in the EBI, he complained about the regime which he described as “ill-befitting a state governed by the rule of law”. Privacy was entirely lacking. Human contact with his wife and children was excessively restricted, any kind of intimacy with them being impossible. His psychological and physical health were affected, the symptoms being daily headaches, shaking and loss of concentration, and he had had to seek the help of the prison psychologist. He referred to the findings of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT – see below). 16. The Appeals Board gave its decision on 31 May 1999. It noted that there had been no new information since May 1996 which would tend to justify the fear that Mr Lorsé might attempt to escape. Moreover, the remainder of his sentence had significantly decreased and that, together with the nature of the offences of which he had been convicted, reduced the prospect that public order would be affected if he did escape. Finally, his behaviour was reported to be good. In these circumstances any doubt should benefit Mr Lorsé. Accordingly, the competent authorities were ordered to reconsider their decision within three weeks taking the decision of the Appeals Board into account. 17. On 15 June 1999 a placement officer of the Penitentiary Selection Centre (Penitentiair Selectie Centrum – “PSC”) recommended that Mr Lorsé should remain in the EBI. Mr Lorsé’s situation was described as “relatively stable”, the fact that his prolonged detention in the EBI was becoming more and more of a burden to him being “a normal reaction to a situation that [was] in many respects relatively extreme (waarbij het feit dat een verblijf in de EBI steeds zwaarder gaat wegen een normale reactie is op een in veel opzichten betrekkelijk extreme situatie). 18. The Minister of Justice gave a new decision on 17 June 1999, again prolonging Mr Lorsé’s detention in the EBI. It was stated that a new decision had been made taking into account advice given by the governor of the Nieuw Vosseveld penitentiary complex and the decision of the Appeals Board. In addition, reference was made to official information dated 4 June 1999 from which it appeared that there was new and recent information to the effect that Mr Lorsé still constituted an increased security risk. The nature of this information was not disclosed but it was concluded that Mr Lorsé was planning an escape with help from outside the institution and possibly involving the use of violence against persons. Reference was also made to the prison sentence which he would have to serve in Belgium. Finally, the Minister was of the opinion that in view of inter alia the seriousness of Mr Lorsé’s offences, public order would be seriously affected if Mr Lorsé managed to escape. Thus, although account had been taken of the decision of the Appeals Board, this latter decision could not prevail over the new official information. 19. Mr Lorsé’s detention in the EBI was again extended on 24 December 1999, since official information of June and November 1999 indicated that he still posed an increased security risk. In its decision of 16 March 2000 on Mr Lorsé’s appeal against the prolongation of his placement in the EBI, the Appeals Board noted his arguments to the effect that his protracted stay in the EBI had negative effects not only on him but also on his relatives, and that he had referred to the present complaint lodged with the Court. Mr Lorsé had also submitted the report of the psychiatrist Dr S. (see paragraph 26 below). The Appeals Board rejected the complaint, finding that in the absence of facts or circumstances militating against a continuation of Mr Lorsé’s detention in the EBI, the decision to prolong his placement was lawful and that, weighing up all the interests involved, it could not be considered unreasonable or unjust. The Appeals Board noted that it had taken into account the arguments raised by Mr Lorsé relating to his psychological condition. 20. By a letter dated 10 July 2000 the Minister of Justice informed Mr Lorsé of a further prolongation of his detention in the EBI. Reference was made to inter alia official information of June and November 1999 according to which Mr Lorsé still posed an increased security risk. There were indications that an attempt at escape would in all likelihood involve the help of co-detainees and/or persons outside the institution and the use of violence, inter alia through explosives, against persons. 21. On 18 July 2000 Mr Lorsé lodged an appeal against the prolongation of his detention at the EBI with the Appeals Board, arguing that the official information of June and November 1999 had no basis in fact and further submitting that his continued detention at the EBI constituted a violation of Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention, not only with respect to himself but also with respect to his wife and children. 22. On 22 November 2000 the Appeals Board rejected the appeal, finding that the risk that Mr Lorsé might escape was still too great to justify detaining him anywhere else than in a maximum security institution. It further considered that its task was to examine the decision to prolong Mr Lorsé’s detention in the EBI, and not the regime pertaining in that institution as such. For that reason, the Appeals Board declined to rule on the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention. As to the complaint of a violation of Article 8 of the Convention, the Appeals Board considered that the second paragraph of that provision allowed for an interference with the right to respect for private and family life as long as such interference was in accordance with the law and was necessary in a democratic society in the interest of, inter alia, the prevention of disorder and crime. The Appeals Board concluded once more that in the absence of facts or circumstances militating against a continuation of Mr Lorsé’s detention in the EBI, the decision to prolong his placement was lawful and that, weighing up all the interests involved, it could not be considered unreasonable or unjust. 23. Besides lodging appeals with the Appeals Board to contest the extension of his maximum security detention, Mr Lorsé, while still detained on remand, also applied for an interim injunction (kort geding) against the State on two occasions, arguing that his placement in the EBI was unlawful. Both applications were rejected, in 1996 and 1998 respectively. 24. On 15 January 2001 Mr Lorsé was transferred from the EBI to a prison in Maastricht with a different regime. Of all prisoners who have been subjected to the maximum security regime in the Netherlands, Mr Lorsé was by far the longest-serving. 25. Mr Lorsé’s psychological condition was examined on a number of occasions. On 14 December 1999 Mr V., the head of the Psychological Department of the PSC, submitted an advisory opinion to the Minister of Justice concerning the prolongation of Mr Lorsé’s placement at the EBI. His report of that date stated: “... The PSC has previously reported on [Mr Lorsé] on 15 June 1999 ... At that time it was reported that [Mr Lorsé], who has been detained in the EBI since 27 September 1994, was finding it increasingly difficult to cope with his stay there. [Mr Lorsé] appeared to have reversed his day-night rhythm. [Mr Lorsé] had no contacts with the prison’s medical and mental health care team. It was reported that, all in all, a picture was beginning to emerge of a man for whom the stay in the EBI was becoming increasingly difficult to bear, with adverse consequences for his functioning. It was advised that an attempt be made to restore contacts with the medical and health care team so that the reaction to a renewed perspective of a further long stay in the EBI might be monitored. The report of the last six months shows ups and downs with more pronounced and more frequent mood swings, especially lately. Apart from the long duration of the stay in the EBI and the lack of contact with the family, the changes in the composition of the [EBI] population also... appear to play a role. All in all, I am of the opinion that the stay in the EBI is increasingly difficult to bear for Mr Lorsé, and, barring concrete evidence regarding the likelihood of an escape attempt, that a transfer is to be preferred on psychosocial grounds alone.” 26. On 14 December 1999 Mr Lorsé was seen, in the EBI, by an independent psychiatrist, Dr S., at the request of his lawyer. Dr S. reported as follows: “I am unable to make a definite psychiatric diagnosis from a single psychiatric examination; in particular, there are insufficient indications to diagnose a depression. There are, nevertheless, a number of indications suggesting that [Mr Lorsé] is suffering under the protracted isolation; he thus describes memory and orientation disorders as well as signs of depersonalisation which clearly point to that being the case. [Mr Lorsé] is a man ... who has learned to survive through toughness. It is debatable whether the psychological carapace he has built up over the years will be capable of withstanding the current extreme isolation, and it is, in my opinion, important therefore that a close eye be kept on him. Should he decompensate in a depressive sense – the risk of which is certainly not hypothetical – this will not be without danger: in such a situation a risk of suicidal actions is not to be underestimated.” 27. On 20 March 2001, some two months after his transfer from the EBI, Mr Lorsé was seen by a different independent psychiatrist, Dr C., who had been requested by his lawyer to examine the psychological consequences of Mr Lorsé’s stay in the EBI. According to Dr C., Mr Lorsé was suffering from a moderately serious (matig ernstig) depression with endogenous features, moderately serious panic attacks and a conditioned avoidance response. Although Mr Lorsé was not found to be suicidal, he was troubled by nightmares relating mainly to suicide. He was also irritable and suffered regular panic attacks. One of the reasons for this psychiatric condition was the fact that contact with his wife and children was seriously disrupted. He was incapable of working, either alone or with others, and his activity level was very much reduced. Dr C. expressed the opinion that there was a causal link between the outward symptoms of the depression as well as the psychiatric disorders he found and Mr Lorsé’s long period of detention in the EBI. These disorders were becoming more marked now that Mr Lorsé had more opportunities to have contacts with other people following his transfer from the EBI. His isolation in the EBI meant that his complaints were less visible to the outside world and he was in a better position there to fight against them. Now that he was receiving more attention, including some from social workers in the prison, there was a lowering of his resistance and fighting spirit against his helplessness and feelings of abandonment. 28. After Dr C.’s report had been transmitted to the Government, they requested Dr D., a forensic psychiatrist employed by the Forensic Psychiatric Service of the Ministry of Justice, to examine Mr Lorsé in order to find out whether he was indeed suffering from the psychiatric disorders described by Dr C. and, if so, whether these disorders were related to his detention in the EBI. Dr D. saw Mr Lorsé twice, in June and July 2001, and she noted in her report of 9 July 2001 that during these meetings he had not displayed any symptoms of a disturbance of a depressive nature. She replied to the questions put by the Government that at the time of her examination, Mr Lorsé was not suffering from a “moderately serious depression”. Although immediately after his transfer from the EBI he had had mild symptoms of an unspecified adjustment disorder, this was now in complete remission. Dr D. acknowledged that this disorder was probably directly related to his prolonged detention in the EBI, but noted that most people who were detained in semi-isolation or maximum security facilities reacted in a similar manner. In Dr D.’s opinion, Mr Lorsé would have presented a similar profile if he had been detained in any other closed penal institution with rules similar to those in the EBI or semi-isolation facilities. 29. In a note dated 16 November 1999, the general practitioner of the third, fourth and fifth applicants described these children as being seriously traumatised as a result of the lack of contact with their father. 30. At the request of Mr Lorsé’s lawyer, the probation services (Reclassering) issued an advisory report on 18 November 1999 describing the situation of Mr Lorsé’s wife and their three children (i.e. the second to fifth applicants). Superficially, they seemed to have managed to cope with the problems they had faced in recent years. However, the very limited possibilities for contact with Mr Lorsé were causing problems. The fourth applicant had developed anorexia nervosa three years previously. The second applicant felt unable to discuss relationship problems with her husband knowing that everything that was said would be recorded and could be used against her husband. In the report, the family was described as “psychological wreckage” (psychisch wrakhout). The process which the three children were going through in relation to their father was likened to a process of mourning. In conclusion, the probation services supported the appeal which Mr Lorsé had instituted against the prolongation of his placement in the EBI. 31. In an information report (voorlichtingsrapport) of 20 March 2001, again requested by Mr Lorsé’s lawyer, the probation services stated that the term “psychological wreckage” was still fully applicable to Mr Lorsé’s family. 32. All Netherlands penal institutions fall into one of five security categories, ranging from very limited security (zeer beperkt beveiligd) to extra security (extra beveiligd). The Minister of Justice lays down criteria according to which prisoners are to be selected for each such category (Article 13 §§ 1 and 3 of the 1999 Prisons Act – Penitentiaire beginselenwet). The actual selection is carried out by a Ministry of Justice placement officer (Article 15 §§ 1 and 3 of the 1999 Prisons Act). 33. EBIs are intended for prisoners who, in descending order of importance, a) are considered extremely likely to attempt to escape from closed penal institutions and who, if they succeed, pose an unacceptable risk to society in terms of again committing serious violent crimes; or b) if they should escape, would pose an unacceptable risk to society in terms of severe disturbance of public order, the risk of escaping being, as such, of lesser importance. 34. A special Ministry of Justice circular governs decisions to detain a prisoner in an extra security category institution or EBI (Ministry of Justice circular no. 646188/97/DJI of 22 August 1997). In principle, placements in the EBI are made from an ordinary custodial institution. The governor of the custodial institution submits a proposal to the placement officer, giving reasons why the persons concerned should be detained in the EBI. Before submitting this proposal, the governor requests information about the person concerned from the secretary of a special EBI selection board, which comprises a representative of the Public Prosecutions Service, a psychologist and a representative of the board of governors of the Nieuw Vosseveld Penitentiary Complex in Vught. The secretary having obtained such information from various sources, the governor then discusses his proposal with the detainee. Finally, he completes his report by adding the detainee’s comments and any objections he may have, and submits his proposal to the selection board. 35. The placement officer considers the proposal, consults with the governor and interviews the detainee. He then draws up his own report on the governor’s proposal and submits it to the selection board secretary. If the detainee is serving a long sentence or if a psychologist considers it necessary, it may be forwarded to the Penitentiary Selection Centre, which is responsible for issuing recommendations on the psychological aspects of the enforcement of custodial sentences and orders. The PSC is always consulted about first placements. The case is subsequently discussed by the selection board, chaired by the placement officer. 36. The decision to detain a prisoner in an EBI is reviewed every six months. The EBI governor must submit a behavioural report (gedragsrapportage) on the detainee at corresponding intervals. Prior to the decision to prolong the placement in the EBI, the detainee is interviewed by the placement officer. In all other respects the procedure is the same as the placement procedure. Decisions as referred to above are nominally those of the Minister of Justice. 37. The 1999 Prisons Act and the Prisons Order (Penitentiaire maatregel) apply in full to detainees in the EBI, giving them the same rights and obligations as detainees in ordinary institutions. A number of security measures is built into the regime, and detainees are under surveillance at all times outside their cells. These special arrangements are set out in the EBI house rules (Regeling model huisregels EBI, 12 October 1998, 715635/98/DJ, Government Gazette 1998, no. 233). The following are features of the EBI regime: – all contacts with the outside world are screened; all correspondence and telephone calls (twice a week for ten minutes) are screened except for those with privileged contacts; detainees must be separated from their visitors (one visit a week for one hour) by a transparent partition (“closed visits”); members of their immediate families, spouses and partners may visit once a month without such partition (“open visits”), although physical contact is restricted to a handshake on arrival and departure; visitors must submit to a search of their clothes (frisking) before an “open” visit; – only one detainee at a time may come into contact with staff, and at least two staff members must be present; for this purpose, special corridors have been built leading to areas where group activities take place; these areas are under camera surveillance or supervised by staff who are physically separated from inmates by a partition; – detainees may take part in sports at least twice a week; they may spend at least one hour a day outdoors and may also use the exercise yard at fixed times during recreation periods in their programme; they are entitled to spend at least six hours a week engaging in group recreation; – no more than four people at a time may take part in group activities; – detainees who leave the premises must be handcuffed, for instance when going to court or for hospital treatment; they may also be handcuffed inside the EBI, in areas where they might have access to objects with which they could injure staff or take hostages, for example when visiting the hairdresser’s or the clinic, or when being escorted to “open” visits; – cells are periodically (in practice: weekly) subjected to a more thorough search; at the same time or immediately afterwards the detainees are frisked and strip-searched; the strip-search, which involves an external viewing of the body’s orifices and crevices, including an anal inspection, is carried out in a closed room and, whenever possible, by a person of the detainee’s own gender; – frisking and strip-searching also takes place ▪ on arrival in and release from the EBI ▪ before and after “open” visits ▪ after visits to the clinic, the dentist’s surgery or the hairdresser’s; – the EBI governor, or in urgent cases an EBI officer or employee, may decide that the detainee must be subjected to an internal body search if this is considered necessary to prevent the maintenance of good order or safety within the prison being endangered, or to protect the detainee’s own health; an internal body search is usually carried out by a doctor but he may also instruct a nurse to carry out the search. 38. If a prisoner wishes to contest the decision either to place him in the EBI or to prolong such placement, he could, at the time relevant to the present case, file an appeal to the three-member Appeals Board of the Central Council for the Administration of Criminal Justice (Article 73 § 1 of the 1999 Prisons Act). The Central Council, which was superseded by the Council for the Administration of Criminal Justice and Protection of Juveniles on 1 April 2001, was constituted of members appointed and dismissed by Royal Decree. Its duties included advising the Minister of Justice, at the latter’s request or proprio motu, on matters concerning the application of policy and legal rules relating to the prison system (Articles 4 §§ 1 and 5 sub 1 of the Prisons Act 1953 – Beginselenwet gevangeniswezen). It also had other duties, including the hearing of appeals. 39. If the Appeals Board considered the appeal well-founded, it could instruct the Minister to make a new decision in which its own decision was to be taken into account, for which it could set a time-limit. It could also rule that its decision was to take the place of the decision appealed against, or confine itself to annulling the latter decision (Article 68 §§ 3 and 4 taken together with Article 73 § 4 of the 1999 Prisons Act). 40. A number of persons detained in the EBI has in the past instituted interim injunction proceedings, sometimes together with close family members, in order to have the regime, or certain aspects of it, relaxed. However, in cases decided under domestic law it has been held that where pursuant to prison law an administrative remedy, with sufficient procedural safeguards, is available against a particular decision, there is no room for an injunction decision that is in conflict with a decision made in the administrative proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, the Supreme Court’s judgment of 25 June 1982, Nederlandse Jurisprudentie (Netherlands Law Reports) 1983, no. 194; and the judgment of the Court of Appeal (Gerechtshof) of The Hague of 22 June 1995, case no. 94/259 KG, relating specifically to aspects of the EBI regime). In cases where such an administrative remedy was available and where detainees and family members instituted injunction proceedings jointly, it has been argued on behalf of the State that those family members should await the outcome of the administrative proceedings even if the family members themselves may not appear as parties to those proceedings. In the aforementioned judgment of the Court of Appeal of The Hague it was held that the interests of family members must be deemed to have been taken into account in the administrative proceedings. 41. In interim injunction proceedings instituted by an EBI detainee, his wife and one of his children, in which one of the points at issue was the EBI governor’s refusal to allow the detainee to conduct telephone conversations in Kurdish, counsel for the State had argued on appeal that the request for an interim injunction should be declared inadmissible, since the detainee’s complaint had already been dealt with by the Central Council. However, by judgment of 18 March 1999, the Court of Appeal of The Hague declared the appeal admissible because, the Central Council having ruled on the detainee’s complaint by then, there was no longer an administrative procedure pending which had to be disposed of on penalty of his civil proceedings being declared inadmissible. The Court of Appeal then proceeded to reject the request for an interim injunction since the Central Council in its decision had considered the decision of the EBI governor lawful and the proceedings before the Central Council were deemed to have sufficient procedural safeguards (case no. 98/1349 KG, Kort Geding (“Interim Injunction Law Reports”) 1999, no. 173). 42. In a decision of 11 January 1994 (case no. 93/1142, Sancties (“Sanctions”) 1994, Issue 1, no. 5), in proceedings lodged by 13 detainees who argued that the maximum security regime was in violation of inter alia Article 3 of the Convention, the President of the Hague Regional Court ordered the State to amend the regime in such a way that detainees be given more time to telephone their lawyers and that they be allowed visits from members of their immediate family without a glass partition and with a modicum of physical contact. Visiting regulations were subsequently changed in line with this judgment. 43. The CPT visited the Netherlands from 17 until 27 November 1997. Its findings with regard to the (T)EBI (Tijdelijke Extra Beveiligde Inrichting – Temporary Extra Security Institution) and the EBI were the following (Report to the Netherlands Government on the visit to the Netherlands carried out by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) from 17 to 27 November 1997, CPT/Inf (98) 15, excerpt): “58. The Nieuw Vosseveld Prison Complex, which is located in a heavily-wooded area of Vught, began life in 1953 as a prison for some 140 young offenders, and has since expanded to become one of the largest prison complexes in the Netherlands. At the time of the CPT’s visit, it had a total capacity of 621 places for young offenders and adult male prisoners. The focus of the CPT’s visit to the establishment was the national ‘extra security institution’ (unit 5), which provides 35 places for prisoners who have been deemed likely to attempt to escape using violence (17 places for remand prisoners and 18 places for convicted inmates). The unit is located in two distinct buildings: the 11place ‘temporary extra security institution’ (Tijdelijk Extra Beveiligde Inrichting - (T)EBI) opened in August 1993 and is physically located in one wing of unit 1, while the 24-place, custom-built, ‘extra security institution’ (Extra Beveiligde Inrichting - EBI) was completed in August 1996. b. material conditions 59. The cells seen by the CPT’s delegation in both the (T)EBI and EBI buildings were of a reasonable size for single occupancy (some 9 m²), appropriately furnished (bed, chair, storage cupboard and table) and equipped with a lavatory and wash basin. In-cell artificial lighting was of a good standard in both buildings; however, access to natural light was noticeably poorer in the (T)EBI (where the cell windows are partially obscured by frosted glass panels) than in the EBI. The ventilation in the (T)EBI cells also left something to be desired. A number of the (T)EBI prisoners interviewed by the delegation complained about these shortcomings. The CPT recommends that steps be taken to improve access to natural light in cells in the (T)EBI. The visiting delegation was informed that work to improve the ventilation system in the (T)EBI was due to begin in January 1998; the Committee would like to receive confirmation that this work has now been completed, together with details of the improvements involved. 60. More generally, while the EBI was located in bright and reasonably spacious premises, the (T)EBI (which is also known as the ‘oud bouw’ or ‘old building’) was a markedly more cramped facility. The CPT would like to be informed of whether the Dutch authorities plan to close the ‘temporary’ extra security institution in the foreseeable future. c. regime 61. The CPT’s views on the nature of the regime which should be offered to prisoners held in special security units were set out in detail in the report on its 1992 visit to the Netherlands. In that context, the Committee welcomed the recommendation of the Hoekstra Commission that any future EBI should have ‘as normal a regime as possible’. In its 1992 report, the CPT stressed that prisoners should enjoy a relatively relaxed regime (able to mix freely with the small number of fellow prisoners in the unit; allowed to move without restriction within what is likely to be a relatively small physical space; granted a good deal of choice about activities, etc.) by way of compensation for their severe custodial situation. Special efforts should be made to develop a good internal atmosphere within such units. The aim should be to build positive relations between staff and prisoners. This is in the interests not only of the humane treatment of the unit’s occupants but also of the maintenance of effective control and security and of staff safety. The existence of a satisfactory programme of activities is just as important – if not more so – in a special detention unit as on normal location. It can do much to counter the deleterious effects upon a prisoner’s personality of living in the bubble-like atmosphere of such a unit. The activities provided should be as diverse as possible (education, sport, work of vocational value etc.) As regards, in particular, work activities, it is clear that security considerations may preclude many types of work activities which are found on normal prison location. Nevertheless, this should not mean that only work of a tedious nature is provided for prisoners. In this respect, reference might be made to the suggestions set out in paragraph 87 of the Explanatory Memorandum to Recommendation No. R(82)17 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. 62. The current regime in the (T)EBI and EBI units is governed by a circular which was issued by the Director General of Prison Services on 22 August 1997 (cf. document 646189/97/DJI). According to the circular: ‘The extra security institution (EBI) at Vught has a limited communication regime. A differentiation of regimes is referred to within the EBI, where a distinction is made between what is known as the A regime, where greater restrictions apply, and the B regime, with less extreme restrictions. Groups of between two and a maximum of four inmates take part in activities. Under the B regime, a maximum of four inmates takes part in communal activities, while the maximum number is three under the A regime. Communal activities involve only inmates from a single section. For security reasons, staff in contact with inmates must always outnumber the inmates, or must even be completely separated from them physically by a transparent (glass) wall. Moreover, with a view to the safety of the staff concerned, in those cases covered by Section 15, sub-sections 2 and 3, chapter III, of the internal regulations of the Vught EBI, inmates’ movements are restricted by handcuffs.’ 63. The delegation found that, in practice, out-of-cell time in the (T)EBI and EBI on a given day varied from a minimum of one hour (of outdoor exercise) to a maximum of some four and a half hours (of outdoor exercise/recreation and/or sport). Depending upon the regime in which an inmate had been placed (A/B) and the group to which they had been allocated, these activities would take place with between one and three other inmates. The outdoor exercise yards in the EBI were of a reasonable size and a ‘running strip’ was available for inmates who wished to engage in more strenuous physical activities. The exercise yards in the (T)EBI were also large enough to enable prisoners to exert themselves physically; however, their cage-like design rendered them rather oppressive facilities. During recreation periods (of one to two hours), inmates were allowed access to communal areas where they could associate with each other, cook and eat their own food, use a computer and/or play games including table tennis. As regards facilities for sport, each of the four units in the EBI was equipped with an impressive array of exercise equipment, located in a lofty glass atrium. However, inmates only had access to this equipment for one or two 45 minute sessions per week. Again, the equivalent facilities in the (T)EBI were of a lower standard. The EBI also had a large and well-equipped gymnasium but, at the time of the visit, it appeared that comparatively little use was being made of this facility. There were no organised education activities. There was also no out-of-cell work; some in-cell work was offered to inmates, but it was of a very unchallenging nature (e.g. stringing plastic curtain hooks onto short rods). 64. All inmate activities within the (T)EBI and EBI were subject to a high level of staff surveillance (which is perfectly understandable in a unit of this type); however, direct contacts between staff and inmates were very limited (staff and inmate usually being separated by armoured glass panels). This is not conducive to building positive relations between staff and prisoners. Contact with non-custodial staff – including medical staff – was also subject to a number of very significant restrictions (...). 65. It should also be noted that prisoners were regularly strip-searched (a practice euphemistically referred to as ‘visitatie’). Such searches – which included anal inspections – were carried out at least once a week on all prisoners, regardless of whether the persons concerned had had any contact with the outside world. 66. Concerning contact with the outside world, it should be noted that the house rules for the (T)EBI and EBI units provide that prisoners have the right to receive one visit of one hour per week from family members and other persons approved in advance by prison management. In principle, visits took place under ‘closed’ conditions (i.e. through an armoured glass panel in a visiting booth). Prisoners also had the right to request one ‘open’ visit per month from family members; however, physical contact during such visits was limited to a handshake on arrival and leaving. Prisoners and their families remained separated by a table equipped with a chest-high barrier and prison staff stood directly behind the prisoner throughout the visit. A number of inmates interviewed by the delegation indicated that, given the upsetting effects which these restrictions had had upon their families, they no longer requested ‘open’ visits. 67. To sum up, prisoners held in the (T)EBI and EBI units were subject to a very impoverished regime. They spent too little time out of their cells; when out of their cells they associated with only a small number of fellow inmates and their relations with staff and visitors were very limited; consequently, they did not have adequate human contact. Further, the programme of activities was underdeveloped. This was particularly the case as regards education and work. However, even as regards sport, inmates had insufficient access to the very good facilities available. Moreover, certain aspects of the regime (in particular, systematic strip-searching) did not appear to respond to legitimate security needs, and are humiliating for prisoners. 68. The delegation’s lengthy interviews with eight prisoners held in the (T)EBI and EBI indicated that the regime as a whole was having harmful psychological consequences for those subjected to it. Indeed, the interviews revealed a consistent association of psychological symptoms which appeared to have been induced by the regime. The inmates concerned displayed the following symptom profile: - feelings of helplessness, which took the form of a disturbance of normal identity and severe difficulty of projection into the future; in certain cases, the loss of identity was associated with definite episodes of depersonalisation; - feelings of powerlessness, closely linked to helplessness, and leading to regression and excessive pre-occupation with bodily functions; - anger, the predominant emotion being one of rage (clearly linked to feelings of powerlessness) and directed against self (with expressions of low esteem, lack of confidence and associated depressive symptoms) and others; - communication difficulties, associated with the above-mentioned depersonalisation symptoms. The delegation’s concerns about the harmful psychological consequences of the regime were reinforced during its subsequent visit to the Dr S. van Mesdag Clinic, where it interviewed a number of patients who had previously been held in the (T)EBI or EBI, in whom persistent psychological sequelae (insomnia; anxiety symptoms; disturbance of identity; emotional liability and psychosomatic symptoms) were clearly present. The CPT would add that it is aware that the psychologist employed in the (T)EBI and EBI has publicly expressed the conviction that the regime has led to ‘no significant harmful effects on prisoners’. However, this opinion has never been subject to any form of peer review or professional assessment. It should be added that the Psychiatric Adviser to the Ministry of Justice Forensic Health Bureau expressed a contrary view to the delegation, citing as an example a case of a prisoner who had developed a florid paranoid psychosis while held in the (T)EBI. 69. In the light of all of the information at its disposal, the CPT has been led to conclude that the regime currently being applied in the (T)EBI and EBI could be considered to amount to inhuman treatment. To subject prisoners classified as dangerous to such a regime could well render them more dangerous still. 70. The facilities in the extra security institution are of a high standard. They are quite capable of offering a regime meeting the criteria set out in paragraph 61 without jeopardising legitimate security concerns. The CPT recommends that the regime currently applied in the extra security institution be revised in the light of the remarks set out in paragraphs 61 to 67. In particular, the existing group system, if not discarded, should at least be relaxed and inmates should be allowed more out-of-cell time and a broader range of activities. Further, the current searching policies should be reviewed in order to ensure that they are strictly necessary from a security standpoint. Similarly, current visiting arrangements should be reviewed; the objective should be to have visits taking place under more open conditions. Finally, the CPT recommends that the Dutch authorities commission an independent study of the psychological state of current and former inmates of the extra security institution.” 44. The Netherlands Government responded in the following terms (Interim report of the Dutch Government in response to the report of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) on its visit to the Netherlands from 17 to 27 November 1997, CPT/Inf (98) 15, excerpt): “3. The ‘Extra Security Institution’ ((T)EBI/EBI) at the Nieuw Vosseveld Prison Complex Recommendations by the CPT 28. (...) (...) 29. The CPT recommends that the regime currently applied in the extra security institution be revised in the light of the remarks set out in paragraphs 61 to 67. In particular, the existing group system, if not discarded, should at least be relaxed and inmates should be allowed more out-of-cell time and a broader range of activities. Further, the current searching policies should be reviewed in order to ensure that they are strictly necessary from a security standpoint. Similarly, current visiting arrangements should be reviewed; the objective should be to have visits taking place under more open conditions (paragraph 70) Response: The (T)EBI houses prisoners who are deemed exceptionally likely to attempt to escape, either with help from outside or by violent means. Generally speaking, they fall into three categories: prisoners believed to be members of criminal organisations; prisoners serving sentences for manslaughter or murder; and prisoners who have escaped from prison in the past either by taking staff hostage or by using firearms (and perhaps with help from outside). Arrangements for the detention of such prisoners need to be based first and foremost on systematic, fail-safe security arrangements, though a humane regime should then be provided within that context. The task of the EBI, like any other prison, is to execute custodial sentences without disruption. The restrictions imposed on prisoners should be no more than are necessary to deprive them of their liberty. What distinguishes the EBI from other prisons is the nature of the restrictions required to achieve that purpose. They must be more severe because the prisoners present, by definition, an above-average risk of escape or disruption of the normal prison regime. In practice, this means that the purpose of the (T)EBI and EBI is to create a place and regime from which it is impossible to escape, even by taking staff hostage. The regime in the EBI is the most severe anywhere in the Netherlands. For that reason, use of the institution is kept to a minimum and the decision to place prisoners there is taken and later reviewed at frequent intervals by a broad-based external committee. Despite the severity of the regime, prisoners in the EBI are offered sufficient out-of-cell time (paragraph 63) and have the opportunity to take part in recreational, sporting, musical, creative, educational and other activities. The range of activities on offer gives prisoners regular opportunities for human contact and the staff of the EBI deliberately strive to encourage such contact and participation in activities wherever possible. The small size of the unit’s population (paragraph 67) is essential to the maintenance of order, security and control and to the prevention of escapes. It is true that there are special restrictions on contact with the outside world (in the form of the glass partition separating prisoners from visitors), but the frequency of visits is the same as in a normal remand centre. The arrangements for searches in the (T)EBI and EBI are essential to ensure the safety of staff. They have been evaluated in the past, as part of the six-monthly assessment of the EBI, and it has been decided that prisoners should not be searched more often than strictly necessary. This means that prisoners are not always searched on return to their cells, but only if they have been out of sight of the warder who let them out. Visits are organised in such a way as to permit visual, verbal and non-verbal contact while preventing direct physical contact. The special visiting arrangements are among the most important security measures to prevent escapes. If visits were more ‘open’ and there were any chance of smuggling contraband into the prison, there would be little point in the existence of the EBI. 30. The CPT recommends that the Dutch authorities commission an independent study of the psychological state of current and former inmates of the extra security institution (paragraph 70) Response: The Ministry of Justice intends to investigate the performance of the EBI in early 1999. It will then consider instituting a further study of the impact of the EBI regime on the psychological state of inmates if the outcome of that investigation gives reason to do so.” 45. The Ministry of Justice commissioned researchers of the University of Nijmegen to conduct a preliminary study of the EBI’s policy on care for the mental well-being of detainees and of the feasibility of a main study of the psychological impact of a high security regime on the mental well-being of (former) inmates. On 17 April 2000 a report entitled “Care in and around the Maximum Security Prison” (Zorg in en om de Extra Beveiligde Inrichting) was issued by the researchers. It concluded that the concern expressed in policy documents for the mental well-being of detainees held in maximum security conditions was indeed evident in the day-to-day running of the EBI in that EBI personnel proved aware of the tension between security and humanity, and endeavoured to reduce this tension. It was further concluded in the report that a study of the psychological impact of a high security regime was feasible. The researchers nevertheless emphasised that they had examined neither the quality of the care for the mental well-being of the EBI detainees, the actual psychological condition of the detainees nor the effects which the regime was having on them. 46. The Minister of Justice has commissioned a follow-up study from the same researchers, involving monitoring day-night rhythm stress and other factors among maximum security detainees and a control group of detainees in semi-isolation. This study is set to be completed by Summer 2003.",['3'],[],[],"['13', '3', '8']",[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Velenje. 6. On 5 December 1995 the applicant was injured in an accident at work in a mine. The applicant’s employer had taken out insurance with the insurance company ZT. 7. On 3 July 1997 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against ZT in the Celje District Court (Okrožno sodišče v Celju) seeking damages in the amount of 9,177,050 tolars (approximately 38,000 euros) for the injuries sustained. Between 31 July 1997 and 6 September 2000 the applicant lodged six preliminary written submissions and/or adduced evidence. On 31 August 1998 and 3 November 1998 he requested that a date be set for a hearing. Of the three hearings held between 26 March 1999 and 25 September 2000 none was adjourned at the request of the applicant. During the proceedings the court appointed two medical experts.

On 26 June 1979 police officers from the İzmir Security Directorate arrested the applicant on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, the THKP-C (Turkish People’s Liberation Party/Front). 11. On 29 June 1979 the applicant was detained on remand. 12. On 4 March 1981 the Military Public Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the İstanbul Martial Law Court against the applicant and 127 other defendants. The Public Prosecutor accused the applicant, inter alia, of membership of an illegal armed organisation, namely the THKP/C, whose object was to undermine the constitutional order and replace it with a Marxist-Leninist regime. He further charged the applicant with having been involved in a number of crimes such as killing of foreign military officers, bombing and opening fire on security forces, organising and participating in illegal meetings. 13. The prosecution sought the death penalty under Article 146 § 1 of the Criminal Code. 14. In a judgment of 8 November 1984 the İstanbul Martial Law Court convicted the applicant of membership of the THKP/C and his involvement in some of the alleged crimes. It sentenced the applicant to lifetime imprisonment under Article 146 § 1 of the Criminal Code. 15. As the applicant’s sentence exceeded 15 years’ imprisonment, his case was automatically referred to the Military Court of Cassation (Askeri Yargıtay). 16. On 12 April 1988 the Military Court of Cassation quashed the applicant’s conviction on the grounds that the first instance court failed to establish the applicant’s involvement in certain of the alleged crimes. It referred the case to the Istanbul Martial Law Court. 17. On 17 August 1990 the Istanbul Martial Law Court convicted the applicant under Article 146 § 1 of the Criminal Code and sentenced him to lifetime imprisonment, permanently debarred him from employment in the civil service and placed him under judicial guardianship. The court ordered the applicant’s release pending trial on the same day. The applicant appealed. 18. Following promulgation of the Law of 27 December 1993, which abolished the jurisdiction of the Martial Law Courts, the Court of Cassation (Yargıtay) acquired jurisdiction over the case and on 4 January 1994 the case file was transmitted to it. 19. On 18 April 1995 the Court of Cassation upheld the applicant’s conviction. 20. Article 146 § 1 of the Criminal Code provides: “Whosoever shall attempt to alter or amend in whole or in part the Constitution of the Republic of Turkey or to effect a coup d’état against the Grand National Assembly formed under the Constitution or to prevent it by force from carrying out its functions shall be liable to the death penalty.”",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1924 and lives in Pianello Val Tidone (Piacenza). 13. On 8 April 1974 the applicant sued Mr P. in the Piacenza District Court seeking damages for the loss she had sustained as a result of works carried out by her neighbour which had resulted, among other things, in sewage being dumped on her property. 14. Preparation of the case for trial began on 11 May 1974. Of the sixty- six hearings listed between 11 November 1974 and 15 June 1995 nineteen were adjourned at the request of the parties, three at the request of the applicant, two at the request of Mr P., four by the court of its own motion, and one on account of a lawyers’ strike; twelve were devoted to organising expert evidence, twelve to the filing of documents and the hearing of witnesses, twelve to attempts to seek a friendly settlement, and one was adjourned in order to allow the parties to make their submissions. 15. In the meantime Mr P.’s lawyer had filed a death certificate with the registry in respect of his client. At a hearing on 29 February 1996 the judge declared the proceedings interrupted. The proceedings were resumed on 25 September 1996 and the judge fixed 11 June 1998 as the date for hearing submissions. On an unspecified date the case was referred to the bench of judges dealing with the oldest cases (sezioni stralcio). At a hearing on 18 November 1999 the parties requested that a date be fixed for hearing oral submissions and the judge adjourned the case to 8 June 2000. The hearing was not held on that date, but adjourned to 12 June 2000. On that date judgment was reserved. 16. In a judgment of 23 October 2000, the text of which was deposited with the registry on the same day, the Piacenza Court allowed the applicant’s claim in part and ordered Mr P.’s heir to move the septic tank that had not been installed at the prescribed distance and to replace part of the applicant’s sullage pipes. It also awarded her 15,000,000 Italian lire (7,747 euros (EUR)). 17. On 17 October 2001 the applicant lodged an application with the Ancona Court of Appeal under Law no. 89 of 24 March 2001, known as the “Pinto Act”, complaining of the excessive length of the above-described proceedings. The applicant requested the court to conclude that there had been a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and to order the Italian Government to pay compensation for the non-pecuniary damage sustained. The applicant claimed 200,000,000 Italian lire (EUR 103,291.37) in non-pecuniary damages and an unquantified amount for costs and expenses. 18. In a decision of 31 January 2002, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 13 February 2002, the Court of Appeal found that the proceedings had been excessively long. It held as follows: “In the instant case, even if the proceedings are not entirely straightforward given the subject of the proceedings (a bitter dispute between neighbours), which has given rise to many attempts at conciliation, hearings of witnesses and an expert report, the length of the proceedings - over 26 years – nonetheless does not appear proportionate to the objective importance and the consequences of the judicial proceedings. With regard to the conduct of the parties, account cannot be taken of the extension of the length of the proceedings owing to legitimate requests or the time necessary to rationalise and ensure the normal conduct of the proceedings given that proceedings are unreasonably long where the applicant cannot be blamed for seeking to prolong the proceedings in his or her own interests (requests for adjournment of hearings, needless objections etc.). With regard to the conduct of the judicial authorities, special consideration must be given, in the instant case, to the entire length of the proceedings for one level of jurisdiction with a great many adjournments which contributed to prolonging the proceedings beyond a reasonable time by causing long and unjustified interruptions (in terms of the Convention, which obliges member States to organise their judicial system in such a way as to ensure compliance with the obligations set forth in Article 6 § 1). In calculating compensation regard will be had only to the period beyond the reasonable time (in accordance with section 2(3)(a) of Law no. 89/2001): clearly no complaint can be made in respect of conduct on the part of persons involved in the proceedings that is in accordance with the law (such as adjournments necessary for the proper conduct of the proceedings). However, the delay by the judicial authorities in giving a final decision was not in accordance with the law: there is absolutely no justification for such delay given that effect must be given to the right to bring legal proceedings in defence of one’s own interests (Article 24 of the Constitution) by a decision rendered within a reasonable time in order to ensure that justice is done in compliance with the procedural guarantees established by the legislature; while having regard to the “chronic” shortage of staff, the delay in the work and the attempt to find a new balance after the latest judicial and procedural reforms. Regarding the calculation of just satisfaction, the pecuniary damage flowing directly from the delay in giving the final decision cannot be considered to have been made out: the damage cannot be objectively proved either by the supposed intention of the applicant to sell the property or by the costs and expenses, which, apart from the fact that they were not referred to by the applicant, have in any event been dealt with by the decision. With regard to non-pecuniary damage, the criterion to be applied is the one indicated under Art. 1226 of the Civil Code, reiterated in Art. 2056, to which s. 2(3) of Law no. 89/2001 refers. The compensation is quantified at 5,000 euros (inclusive of interest and monetary depreciation – without going into details – see Cass 2910/1995, to which will be added interest accrued only in respect of the time that elapses between the decision and payment), on account of the special nature of the case, the subject of the dispute and the period beyond the reasonable time, the number of levels of jurisdiction and the special subjective situation: on account of the length of the proceedings the applicant has undoubtedly suffered anxiety and distress as a result of waiting for the final decision and uncertainty as to the outcome of the proceedings.” The Court of Appeal dismissed the claim for pecuniary damages on the ground that the applicant had failed to substantiate it, awarded her EUR 5,000 on an equitable basis in compensation for non-pecuniary damage and EUR 860 for costs and expenses. The decision was served on the applicant on 13 March 2002. 19. The applicant appealed to the Court of Cassation against that decision on 21 May 2002 on the ground that the amount awarded her by the Court of Appeal was inadequate. 20. However, in a judgment of 12 November 2002, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 3 January 2003, the Court of Cassation declared the appeal inadmissible on the ground that it had been lodged out of time. The authorities paid the amounts due on 23 December 2003. 21. In a letter of 25 August 2003 the applicant informed the Court of the outcome of the domestic proceedings and asked it to resume its examination of her application. 22.

Anyone sustaining pecuniary or non-pecuniary damage as a result of a violation of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ratified by Law no. 848 of 4 August 1955, on account of a failure to comply with the ‘reasonable-time’ requirement in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, shall be entitled to just satisfaction. 2. In determining whether there has been a violation, the court shall have regard to the complexity of the case and, in the light thereof, the conduct of the parties and of the judge deciding procedural issues, and also the conduct of any authority required to participate in or contribute to the resolution of the case. 3. The court shall assess the quantum of damage in accordance with Article 2056 of the Civil Code and shall apply the following rules: (a) only damage attributable to the period beyond the reasonable time referred to in subsection 1 may be taken into account; (b) in addition to the payment of a sum of money, reparation for non-pecuniary damage shall be made by giving suitable publicity to the finding of a violation.” Section 3 Procedure “1. Claims for just satisfaction shall be lodged with the court of appeal in which the judge sits who has jurisdiction under Article 11 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to try cases concerning members of the judiciary in the district where the case in which the violation is alleged to have occurred was decided or discontinued at the merits stage or is still pending. 2. The claim shall be made on an application lodged with the registry of the court of appeal by a lawyer holding a special authority containing all the information prescribed by Article 125 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 3. The application shall be made against the Minister of Justice where the alleged violation has taken place in proceedings in the ordinary courts, the Minister of Defence where it has taken place in proceedings before the military courts and the Finance Minister where it has taken place in proceedings before the tax commissioners. In all other cases, the application shall be made against the Prime Minister. 4. The court of appeal shall hear the application in accordance with Articles 737 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure. The application and the order setting the case down for hearing shall be served by the applicant on the defendant authority at its elected domicile at the offices of State Counsel (Avvocatura dello Stato) at least fifteen days prior to the date of the hearing before the Chamber. 5. The parties may apply to the court for an order for production of all or part of the procedural and other documents from the proceedings in which the violation referred to in section 2 is alleged to have occurred and they and their lawyers shall be entitled to be heard by the court in private if they attend the hearing. The parties may lodge memorials and documents up till five days before the date set for the hearing or until expiry of the time allowed by the court of appeal for that purpose on an application by the parties. 6. The court shall deliver a decision within four months after the application is lodged. An appeal shall lie to the Court of Cassation. The decision shall be enforceable immediately. 7. To the extent that resources permit, payment of compensation to those entitled shall commence on 1 January 2002.” Section 4 Time-limits and procedures for lodging applications “A claim for just satisfaction may be lodged while the proceedings in which the violation is alleged to have occurred are pending or within six months from the date when the decision ending the proceedings becomes final. Claims lodged after that date shall be time-barred.” Section 5 Communications “If the court decides to allow an application, its decision shall be communicated by the registry to the parties, to State Counsel at the Court of Audit to enable him to start an investigation into liability, and to the authorities responsible for deciding whether to institute disciplinary proceedings against the civil servants involved in the proceedings in any capacity.” Section 6 Transitional provisions “1. Within six months after the entry into force of this Act, anyone who has lodged an application with the European Court of Human Rights in due time complaining of a violation of the ‘reasonable-time’ requirement contained in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ratified by Law no. 848 of 4 August 1955, shall be entitled to lodge a claim under section 3 hereof provided that the application has not by then been declared admissible by the European Court. In such cases, the application to the court of appeal must state when the application to the said European Court was made. 2. The registry of the relevant court shall inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs without delay of any claim lodged in accordance with section 3 and within the period laid down in subsection 1 of this section.” Section 7 Financial provisions “1. The financial cost of implementing this Act, which is put at 12,705,000,000 Italian lire from 2002, shall be met by releasing funds entered in the three-year budget 2001-03 in the chapter concerning the basic current-liability estimates from the ‘special fund’ in the year 2001 forecast of the Ministry of the Treasury, Economy and Financial Planning. Treasury deposits shall be set aside for that purpose. 2. The Ministry of the Treasury, Economy and Financial Planning is authorised to make the appropriate budgetary adjustments by decree.” 23. On appeal from decisions delivered by the courts of appeal in “Pinto” proceedings, the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court (Sezioni Unite), gave four judgments (nos. 1338, 1339, 1340 and 1341) on 27 November 2003, the texts of which were deposited with the registry on 26 January 2004, quashing the appeal court’s decision and remitting the case for a rehearing. It held that “the case-law of the Strasbourg Court is binding on the Italian courts regarding the application of Law no. 89/2001”. In its judgment no. 1340 it affirmed, inter alia, the principle that “the court of appeal’s determination of non-pecuniary damage in accordance with section 2 of Law no. 89/2001, although inherently based on equitable principles, must be done in a legally defined framework since reference has to be made to the amounts awarded, in similar cases, by the Strasbourg Court. Some divergence is permissible, within reason.” 24. Extracts from the plenary Court of Cassation’s judgment no. 1339 deposited with the registry on 26 January 2004 “... 2.- The present application poses the fundamental question of what legal effect must be given – in implementing the Law of 24 March 2001 no. 89, and in particular in determining the non-pecuniary damage arising out of the breach of the reasonable length of proceedings requirement – to the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, whether considered generally as interpretative guidelines which the said Court has laid down with regard to the consequences of the said violation, or with reference to a specific case in which the European Court has already had occasion to give a judgment on the delay in reaching a decision. ... As stipulated in section 2.1 of the said Law, the legal fact which gives rise to the right to the just satisfaction that it provides for is constituted by the “violation of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ratified in accordance with the Law of 4 August 1955 no. 848, for failure to comply with the reasonable time referred to in Article 6, paragraph 1 of the Convention.” In other words, Law no. 89/2001 identifies the fact constituting the right to compensation by reference to a specific provision of the European Convention on Human Rights. This Convention instituted a Court (the European Court of Human Rights, with its seat in Strasbourg) to ensure compliance with the provisions contained therein (Article 19). Accordingly, the competence of the said court to determine, and therefore to interpret, the significance of the said provisions must be recognised. As the fact constituting the right conferred by Law no. 89/2001 consists of a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights, it is for the Court of the European Convention on Human Rights to determine all the elements of such a legal fact, which thus ends by being “brought into conformity” by the Strasbourg Court, whose case-law is binding on the Italian courts in so far as the application of Law no. 89/2001 is concerned. It is not necessary therefore to pose the general problem of the relationships between the European Convention on Human Rights and the internal judicial system, which the Advocate-General (Procuratore Generale) has amply discussed in court. Whatever opinion one may have about that controversial issue and therefore about the place of the European Convention on Human Rights in the context of the sources of domestic law, it is certain that the direct implementation in the Italian judicial system of a provision of the European Convention on Human Rights, established by Law no. 89/2001 (that is, by Article 6 § 1 in the part relating to “reasonable time”), cannot diverge from the interpretation which the European Court gives of the same provision. The opposite argument, which would permit a substantial divergence between the application accorded to Law no. 89/2001 in the national system and the interpretation given by the Strasbourg Court to the right to reasonable length of proceedings, would deprive the said Law no. 89/2001 of any justification and cause the Italian State to violate Article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights, according to which ‘The High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of this Convention’ (including the said Article 6, which provides for the right to have a case decided within a reasonable length of time). The reason behind the enactment of Law no. 89/2001 was the need to provide a domestic judicial remedy against violations in respect of the duration of proceedings, so as to give effect to the subsidiary character of intervention on the part of the Court of Strasbourg, expressly provided for by the European Convention on Human Rights (Article 35: “the Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted”). The European system for the protection of human rights is founded on the said principle of subsidiarity. From it derives the duty of the States which have ratified the European Convention on Human Rights to guarantee to individuals the protection of the rights recognised by the European Convention on Human Rights, above all in their own internal order and vis-à-vis the organs of the national judicial system. And this protection must be “effective” (Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights), that is, of a kind to remedy the claim without the need for recourse to the Strasbourg Court. The domestic remedy introduced by Law no. 89/2001 did not previously exist in the Italian system, with the consequence that appeals against Italy in respect of a violation of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights had “clogged” (the term used by rapporteur Follieri in the sitting of the Senate of 28 September 2000) the European Court. The Strasbourg Court observed, prior to Law no. 89/2001, that the said failures to comply on the part of Italy “reflect a continuing situation that has not yet been remedied and in respect of which litigants have no domestic remedy. This accumulation of breaches accordingly constitutes a practice that is incompatible with the Convention” (see the four judgments of the Court delivered on 28 July 1999 in the cases of Bottazzi, Di Mauro, Ferrari and A. P.). Law no. 89/2001 constitutes the domestic remedy to which a “victim of a violation” (as defined by Article 34 of the European Convention on Human Rights) of Article 6 (failure to comply with the reasonable-time requirement) must have recourse before applying to the European Court to claim the “just satisfaction” provided for in Article 41 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which, when the violation exists, is only awarded by the Court “if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made”. Law no. 89/2001 has therefore allowed the European Court to declare inadmissible applications lodged with it (including before the Act was passed) and aimed at obtaining just satisfaction provided for in Article 41 of the European Convention on Human Rights for the excessive length of proceedings (Brusco v. Italy, decision of 6 September 2001). This mechanism for implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights and observance of the principle of subsidiarity in respect of interventions of the European Court of Strasbourg does not operate, however, in cases in which the Court holds that the consequences of the established violation of the European Convention on Human Rights have not been redressed by domestic law or that this has been done only “partially”, because in such an event the said Article 41 provides for the intervention of the European Court to protect the “victim of the violation”. In such cases an individual application to the Strasbourg Court on the basis of Article 34 of the European Convention on Human Rights is admissible (Scordino and Others v. Italy, decision of 27 March 2003) and the Court acts directly to protect the rights of the victim whom it considers not to have been adequately protected by domestic law. The judge of the adequacy or inadequacy of the protection that the victim has had from domestic law is, obviously, the European Court, whose duty it is to apply Article 41 of the European Convention on Human Rights to ascertain whether, in the presence of a violation of a provision of the European Convention on Human Rights, the internal law has been able to fully redress the consequences of this violation. The argument whereby, in applying Law no. 89/2001, the Italian court may follow a different interpretation from that which the European Court has given to the provisions of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (violation of which is the fact giving entitlement to the right to compensation attributed by the said national law) implies that the victim of the violation, if he or she receives reparation at national level considered inadequate by the European Court, must obtain the just satisfaction provided for in Article 41 of the European Convention on Human Rights from the latter Court. This would defeat the purpose of the remedy provided for in Italian law by Law no. 89/2001 and entail a violation of the principle of the subsidiarity of the intervention of the Strasbourg Court. It is therefore necessary to concur with the European Court of Human Rights, which, in the above-mentioned decision on the Scordino application (concerning the inadequacy of the protection afforded by the Italian courts in implementing Law no. 89/2001), affirmed that “it follows from the principle of subsidiarity ... that the national courts must, where possible, interpret and apply domestic law in accordance with the Convention”. ... The preparatory documents of Law no. 89/2001 are even more explicit. In the report concerning the bill of Senator Pinto (proceedings of the Senate no. 3813 of 16 February 1999) it is affirmed that the compensatory mechanism proposed in the legislative initiative (and then adopted by the Act) secures for the applicant “a protection analogous to that which he or she would receive in the international court”, as the direct reference to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights makes it possible to transfer to domestic level “the limits of applicability of the same provision existing at international level, limits which depend essentially on the State and on the development of the case-law of the Strasbourg authorities, especially that of the European Court of Human Rights, whose decisions must therefore guide ... the domestic court in the definition of these limits”. ... 6. – The considerations expounded in sections 3-5 of the document refer in general to the importance of the interpretative guidance of the European Court on the implementation of Law no. 89/2001 with regard to reparation for non-pecuniary damage. In this particular instance, however, any possibility for the national court to exclude non-pecuniary damage (despite having found a violation of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights) must be considered as non-existent because such is precluded by the previous decision of the European Court which, with reference to the same proceedings, had already ascertained that the unjustified delay in reaching a decision had had consequences involving non-pecuniary damage for the applicant, which the Court itself redressed for a limited period. From such a decision of the European Court it follows that, once the national court has ascertained that the violation has continued in the period following that considered in the said decision, the applicant has continued to suffer non-pecuniary damage, which must be compensated for in application of Law no. 89/2001. It cannot therefore be maintained – as the Rome Court of Appeal has done – that compensation is not due because of the small amounts at stake in the proceedings in question. Such a reason, apart from being rendered immaterial by the fact that the European Court has already ruled that non-pecuniary damage had been sustained because of delay in the same action, is in any case incorrect, because the amount of what is at stake in an action in which non-compliance with reasonable time-limits has been ascertained can never have the effect of excluding non-pecuniary damage, given that the anxiety and distress resulting from the length of the proceedings normally also occur in cases in which the amounts at stake are small; hence this aspect may have the effect of reducing the amount of compensation but not of totally excluding it. 7 – In conclusion the decision appealed against must be quashed and the case remitted to the Rome Court of Appeal, which, in a different composition, will order payment to the applicant of the non-pecuniary damages payable as a result of the violation of the reasonable-time requirement for the period following 16 April 1996 alone, taking as a reference point payments of the same kind of damages by the European Court of Human Rights, from which it may diverge, but only to a reasonable extent (HR Court, 27 March 2003, Scordino v. Italy)”. 25. The Court of Cassation held as follows: “...Where the victim of unreasonably lengthy proceedings dies prior to the entry into force of Law no. 89 of 2001 [known as the “Pinto Act”] this shall preclude a right [to just satisfaction] from arising and passing to the heirs, in accordance with the general rule that a person who has died cannot become entitled to a right conferred by an Act that is passed after their death...” 26. The Court of Cassation judges noted that the right to compensation for a violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time derived from the Pinto Act. The mechanism set in place by the European standard did not give applicants a cause of action before the domestic courts. Accordingly, the right to “just satisfaction” could neither be acquired nor transferred by a person who had already died by the time the Pinto Act came into force. The fact that the deceased had, while alive, lodged an application with the Strasbourg Court was not decisive. Section 6 of the Pinto Act did not constitute, as the applicants had maintained, a procedural standard bringing about a transfer of powers from the European Court to the domestic courts. 27. In this case, which concerned the possibility or otherwise of transferring to heirs the right to compensation deriving from a breach of Article 6 § 1 on account of the length of the proceedings, the First Division of the Court of Cassation referred the case to the full court indicating that there was a conflict between the case-law authorities, that is, between the restrictive approach taken by the Court of Cassation in the earlier judgments regarding heirs and the Pinto Act and the four judgments delivered by the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, on 26 January 2004 to the extent that a less strict interpretation would lead to the conclusion that this right to compensation has existed since Italy ratified the European Convention on 4 August 1955. 28. In the case giving rise to the order mentioned above referring the case to the full court (see preceding paragraph), the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, established the following principles, thus preventing any further conflicting decisions being given by the courts: (i) Law no. 848 of 4 August 1955, which ratified the Convention and made it enforceable, introduced into domestic legal order the fundamental rights, belonging to the category of rights conferred on the individual by public law, provided for in the first section of the Convention and which correspond to a large extent with those set forth in Article 2 of the Constitution. In that respect the Convention provisions are confirmatory and illustrative. ... (ii) It is necessary to reiterate the principle that the act giving rise to the right to reparation conferred by domestic law corresponds to a breach of the provision in Article 6 of the Convention, which is immediately applicable in domestic law. The distinction between the right to a hearing within a reasonable time, introduced by the European Convention on Human Rights (or even pre-existing as a constitutionally protected value), and the right to equitable reparation, which was allegedly introduced only by the Pinto Act, cannot be allowed in so far as the protection provided by the domestic courts does not depart from that previously offered by the Strasbourg Court, the domestic courts being bound to comply with the case-law of the European Court. ... (iii) Accordingly, the right to equitable reparation for loss sustained as a result of the unreasonable length of proceedings prior to the entry into force of Law no. 89/2001 must be acknowledged by the domestic courts even in favour of the heirs of a party who introduced the proceedings before that date, subject only to the condition that the claim has not already been lodged with the Strasbourg Court and the Court has not ruled on admissibility. ... 29. This judgment of the Court of Cassation concerned an appeal by the Ministry of Justice challenging the Court of Appeal’s award of non-pecuniary damages to a juristic person. The Court of Cassation referred to the decision reached in the case of Comingersoll v. Portugal [GC], no. 35382/97, ECHR 2000IV and, after referring to the four judgments of the full court delivered on 26 January 2004, found that its own case-law was not in line with the European Court. It held that there was no legal barrier to awarding just satisfaction to “juristic” persons according to the criteria of the Strasbourg Court. Accordingly, since the Court of Appeal had correctly decided the case the appeal was dismissed. 30. The Court of Cassation made the following observations: “ ... [Whereas] non-pecuniary damage is the normal, albeit not automatic, consequence of a breach of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time, it will be deemed to exist, without it being necessary to specifically prove it (directly or by presumption), on the basis of the objective fact of the breach, on condition that there are no special circumstances indicating the absence of any such damage in the actual case concerned (Cass. A.P. 26 January 2004 nos. 1338 and 1339). - the assessment on an equitable basis of compensation for non-pecuniary damage is subject – on account of the specific reference in section 2 of Law no. 89 of 24 March 2001 to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ratified by Law no. 848 of 4 August 1955) – to compliance with the Convention, in accordance with the judicial interpretation given by the Strasbourg Court (non-compliance with which results in a violation of the law), and must therefore, as far as possible, be commensurate, in substantive and not merely formal terms, with the amounts paid in similar cases by the European Court, it being possible to adduce exceptional circumstances that suggest themselves in the particular case, on condition that they are reasoned, not excessive and not unreasonable (Cass. A.P. 26 January 2004 no. 1340). ... - a discrepancy in the method of calculation [between the Court’s case-law and section 2 of the Pinto Act] shall not affect the general vocation of Law no. 89 of 2001 to meet the objective of awarding proper compensation for a breach of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time (vocation acknowledged by the European Court in, inter alia, a decision of 27 March 2003 in Scordino v. Italy (application no. 36813/97)), and accordingly shall not allow any doubt as to the compatibility of that domestic standard with the international commitments entered into by the Italian Republic when ratifying the European Convention and the formal recognition, also at constitutional level, of the principle stated in Article 6 § 1 of that Convention...” 31. In the report CM/Inf/DH(2004)23, revised on 24 September 2004, the Ministers’ deputies made the following indications regarding an assessment of the Pinto remedy: “...11. As regards the domestic remedy introduced in 2001 by the “Pinto Act”, a number of shortcomings remain, particularly in connection with the effectiveness of the remedy and its application in conformity with the Convention: in particular, the law does not provide yet for the acceleration of pending proceedings. ... 109. In the framework of its examination of the 1st annual report, the Committee of Ministers expressed concern at the fact that this legislation did not foresee the speeding up of the proceedings and that its application posed a risk of aggravating the backlog of the appeal courts. ... 112. It should be pointed out that in the framework of its examination of the 2nd annual report, the Committee of Ministers had noted with concern that the Convention had no direct effect and had consequently invited the Italian authorities to intensify their efforts at national level as well as their contacts with the different bodies of the Council of Europe competent in this field. ...” 32. In this interim resolution the Ministers’ deputies indicated as follows: “The Committee of Ministers Noting ... “...the setting-up of a domestic remedy providing compensation in cases of excessive length of proceedings, adopted in 2001 (the ""Pinto” law), as well as the recent development of the case-law of the Court of cassation, increasing the direct effect of the case-law of the European Court in the Italian legal system, while noting that this remedy still does not enable for acceleration of proceedings so as to grant effective redress to all victims; Stressing that the setting-up of domestic remedies does not dispense states from their general obligation to solve the structural problems underlying violations; Finding that despite the efforts undertaken, numerous elements still indicate that the solution to the problem will not be found in the near future (as evidenced in particular by the statistical data, the new cases before both domestic courts and the European Court, the information contained in the annual reports submitted by the government to the Committee and in the reports of the Prosecutor General at the Court of cassation); ... Stressing the importance the Convention attaches to the right to fair administration of justice in a democratic society and recalling that the problem of the excessive length of judicial proceedings, by reason of its persistence and extent, constitutes a real danger for the respect of the rule of law in Italy; ... URGES the Italian authorities to enhance their political commitment and make it their effective priority to meet Italy’s obligation under the Convention and the Court’s judgments, to secure the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time to all persons under Italy’s jurisdiction. ...” 33. The European Commission for the efficiency of justice was set up at the Council of Europe by Resolution Res(2002)12 with the aim of (a) improving the efficiency and the functioning of the justice of member States with a view to ensuring that everyone within their jurisdiction can enforce their legal rights effectively, thereby generating increased confidence of the citizens in the justice system and (b) enabling a better implementation of the international legal instruments of the Council of Europe concerning efficiency and fairness of justice. 34. In its framework programme (CEPEJ (2004) 19 Rev 2 § (7) the CEPEJ noted that “the mechanisms which are limited to compensation are too weak and do not adequately incite the States to modify their operational process, and provide compensation only a posteriori in the event of a proven violation instead of trying to find a solution for the problem of delays.”",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Istanbul. 6. The applicant is the owner of a daily newspaper, Günlük Evrensel, published in Istanbul. 7. Günlük Evrensel released its first issue on 23 July 2001. On the same day, the state of emergency regional governor in south-east Turkey banned the newspaper's entry and distribution in the provinces under his jurisdiction, namely, Diyarbakır, Tunceli, Hakkari and Şırnak. The governor considered that the newspaper was pursuing the same editorial line as another newspaper called Yeni Evrensel, the entry and distribution of which had also been banned on 4 January 1999. 8. The governor's decision to ban Günlük Evrensel, which contained no reasons, was served on the newspaper's Diyarbakır representative on 23 July 2001. The representative acknowledged its receipt on the same day and the ban took immediate effect. 9. While banned in the state of emergency region, the newspaper was freely distributed elsewhere in Turkey. 10. The governor's office of the state of emergency region was set up with special powers after the state of siege was officially declared to be over on 19 July 1987 by Legislative Decree no. 285 of 10 July 1987. A state of emergency was thus decreed in the provinces of Bingöl, Diyarbakır, Elazığ, Hakkari, Mardin, Siirt, Tunceli and Van. On 19 March 1994 the state of emergency was extended to the province of Bitlis, but lifted in the province of Elazığ. It was declared to be over in the provinces of Batman, Bingöl and Bitlis on 2 October 1997, in the province of Van on 30 July 2000 and in the provinces of Tunceli and Hakkari on 1 August 2002. In July 2002 it was extended by four months in the provinces of Diyarbakır and Şırnak. 11. The powers of the governor of the state of emergency region (Olağanüstü Hal Bölge Valisi) are set out in the State of Emergency Act (Law no. 2935 of 25 October 1983) and various legislative decrees that were issued after the state of emergency was declared (Legislative Decrees nos. 313, 387, 413, 421, 425, 426, 427, 428, 430, 432 and 481). 12. Section 11(e) of the State Emergency Act reads as follows: “... If a state of emergency is decreed, the following measures may be imposed with a view to maintaining general security, safety and public order and to preventing any escalation of the violence...: ... (e) An order prohibiting, either absolutely or without prior permission, the editing, dissemination, publication or distribution of newspapers, reviews, brochures, pamphlets, posters or any similar publications, or the publication or distribution of any such [publications] which have been printed or disseminated outside the state of emergency region ...” 13. Article 1 (a) of Legislative Decree no. 430 provides: “The printing, dissemination, publication or distribution of books, reviews, newspapers, brochures, posters or other similar publications liable seriously to undermine public order in the region, to cause agitation among the local population or to obstruct the security forces in the course of their duties by giving a false account of operations being conducted in the region shall be prohibited, either absolutely or without the prior permission of the governor of the region to which the state of emergency applies or the governors of the provinces concerned. [Likewise,] the publication or distribution of [any publication of the same type] that has been printed and published outside the state of emergency region shall be prohibited, either absolutely or without the prior permission of the governor of the region to which the state of emergency applies or the governors of the provinces concerned ...” 14. The relevant part of Article 148 § 1 of the Constitution provides: “... There shall be no right of appeal to the Constitutional Court to contest the form or substance of legislative decrees issued during a state of emergency, a state of siege or in wartime.” 15. Article 7 of Legislative Decree no. 285, as amended by Legislative Decree no. 425 of 9 May 1990, precludes any application in the administrative courts to have an administrative act performed pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 285 set aside. 16. Article 8 of Legislative Decree no. 430 reads as follows: “No criminal, financial or civil liability may be asserted against ... the governor of the state of emergency region or provincial governors in that region in respect of decisions taken, or acts performed, by them in the exercise of the powers conferred on them by this legislative decree, and no application shall be made to any judicial authority to that end. This shall be without prejudice to the rights of individuals to claim reparation from the State for damage which they have been caused without justification [sebepsiz].” 17. The Constitutional Court has reviewed the constitutionality of Article 7 of Legislative Decree no. 285, as amended by Legislative Decree no. 425 of 9 May 1990, in a judgment of 10 January 1991, which was published in the Official Gazette on 5 March 1992. It stated: “It is not possible to reconcile that provision [which precludes any judicial scrutiny of acts performed by the governor of the state of emergency region] with the concept of the rule of law ... The system of government when a state of emergency has been declared is not an arbitrary one that escapes all judicial scrutiny. There can be no doubt that individual and regulatory acts performed by the competent authorities while the state of emergency continues must be subject to judicial review. Contravention of this principle is inconceivable in countries run by democratic regimes and founded on freedom. However, the impugned provision is contained in a legislative decree that cannot be the subject of constitutional review ... Consequently, the application for an order quashing that provision must be dismissed as being incompatible ratione materiae [yetkisizlik] ...” 18. As regards Article 8 of Legislative Decree no. 430, in two judgments delivered on 3 July 1991 and 26 May 1992 (published in the Official Gazette on 8 March 1992 and 18 December 1993 respectively), the Constitutional Court followed that decision in dismissing as incompatible ratione materiae applications for orders quashing the relevant provisions.","['10', '13']",[],[],['14'],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1941. 5. On 9 April 1998 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of fraud. On 10 April 1998 he was brought before an investigating judge of the Skopje Court of First Instance (“the trial court”). The minutes of the hearing held on that date recorded that he had an insufficient command of Macedonian, but that he would agree, if need be, to have some phrases re-read or explained in detail. However, in the absence of his lawyer he remained silent. The investigation started and the applicant was remanded in custody. On 16 April 1998 he was again brought before the investigating judge and this time, in the presence of his lawyer, he produced evidence in Serbian stating that he had a limited command of Macedonian. He gave his testimony in the presence of Ms O.T., a court-certified interpreter. He signed the minutes without making any comment or objection. 6. On 29 April 1998 the public prosecutor lodged a bill of indictment. On 8 May 1998 the applicant objected on the ground that the bill was defective because it was not supported by sufficient evidence. On 15 May 1998 the trial court dismissed the applicant's objection. 7. On 23 June 1998 the applicant appointed another lawyer to represent him in the proceedings. 8. Four hearings fixed between July and September 1998 were adjourned owing to the applicant's request to use Hebrew, his mother tongue. 9. On 6 August 1998 he was released on bail. 10. On an unspecified date between September and December 1998, the trial court, at the applicant's suggestion, appointed Mr E.F., a Hebrew-speaking employee in a Skopje-based non-governmental organisation, as interpreter. 11. A hearing fixed for 15 January 1999 was rescheduled owing to the absence of Mr E.F. 12. On 29 April 1998 an investigation started in respect of the applicant into two other counts of fraud. On 1 June 1998 the public prosecutor lodged an indictment against the applicant. On 11 June 1998 the applicant objected on the ground of lack of evidence to support the charges against him. He also requested that the bill of indictment be translated into Hebrew. On 20 October 1998, in the presence of the applicant and his second lawyer, the trial court dismissed the applicant's objection. 13. On 10 March 1999 the trial court joined the two sets of proceedings. 14. Between 15 January 1999 and 12 September 2001, the trial court fixed nineteen hearings of which three were adjourned at the applicant's request, five owing to the absence of either an expert, who was called upon to provide an opinion of the applicant's signature, the public prosecutor or Mr E.F. and two owing to the absence of the trial judge and a strike by the court administration. During this time, the proceedings were conducted with the assistance of Mr E.F. In his presence, the court heard the applicant, the expert and several witnesses, two of which were foreign nationals, and obtained an expert report on the applicant's signature. At hearings on 10 March and 12 October 1999, and 12 September 2001, the applicant confirmed his testimony given in the pre-trial proceedings and stated that he had understood the bills of indictment communicated to him. 15. On 30 September 2001 Mr E.F. left the State and informed the trial court that he could no longer provide interpretation. By 3 March 2004, fifteen hearings were postponed because the trial court could not secure the attendance of Mr E.F. or another interpreter into Hebrew. At a hearing of 21 June 2002, the applicant insisted on having interpretation into Hebrew and refused the court's offer of English or Serbian interpretation. The Ministry of Justice stated that there was no court-certified interpreter into Hebrew registered in the respondent State who, under the rules of court, would be authorised to assist in court. The Jewish Association also replied that none of its members had sufficient command of Hebrew. 16. According to the minutes of the hearing held on 19 March 2003, the applicant stated that he had been living in the respondent State for ten years and had used English and Serbian for everyday communication. However, since his command of these languages was limited, he had insisted on having interpretation into Hebrew. 17. On 21 April 2003 a Skopje-based foreign language school issued a certificate attesting to the applicant's level of Macedonian. According to the latter, the applicant had limited understanding of Macedonian; he replied in Serbian; he could partly understand a written text if it was in Latin script but he could write only in Serbian. The applicant stated that he had submitted this certificate to the court as evidence. 18. At a hearing of 29 September 2003, the applicant stated that he used Macedonian, Serbian, Bulgarian and English for everyday communication. He signed contracts in Macedonian or English. In case something had to be added, he would ask his sons in Israel, in Hebrew, to translate the relevant part into English. 19. At a hearing of 17 November 2003, the applicant, when asked by the court, stated that he “used Macedonian, Serbian and English for everyday communication, but ... could not write or read in these languages or use them in the proceedings”. The applicant further stated that in the pre-trial proceedings, meaning the questioning of April 1998, he had made his statement in Serbian – despite having limited command of it – on the instructions of his lawyer, who, he alleged, had been working in concert with the police and who had set him up to sign the minutes. 20. In view of the applicant's statements, on 28 January 2004 the trial court appointed two interpreters into English, Serbian and Bulgarian, one of whom was Ms O.T. 21. From 3 March 2004 the proceedings were conducted with the assistance of these two interpreters. Three adjournments were ordered owing to the applicant's absence. 22. On 10 November 2004 the trial court ordered, at the applicant's request, that the bills of indictment of 29 April and 1 June 1998, be translated into English and Serbian. On 29 December 2004 the applicant returned the translated versions saying that he was proficient only in Hebrew. 23. From 15 January 2005, a third lawyer represented the applicant in the proceedings. At a hearing of 17 January 2005, the trial court refused his request for all documents in the case file to be translated into Hebrew since they had already been orally translated by Mr E.F., in whose presence the court had admitted other evidence. 24. At hearings held on 4 and 15 April 2005 and after the applicant's lawyer had given extensive concluding remarks, the trial court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to two years and six months' imprisonment. It also ordered a security measure – expulsion from the respondent State for four years. 25. On 29 September 2005 the applicant lodged an appeal written in Hebrew. At the trial court's request, he submitted a certified copy in Macedonian. He complained that, inter alia, he had not been given the right to use Hebrew even though the trial court had accepted that he had a limited command of Serbian and English. He argued that his initial statement in Serbian had been made under duress. He further complained that evidence against him had been admitted in the form of photocopies. 26. At a public hearing held on 18 April 2006, the Skopje Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal. It rejected his arguments concerning the use of Hebrew, relying on his initial statement of 16 April 1998 made in Serbian and the fact that all the admitted evidence had been translated into Hebrew with the assistance of Mr E.F. It also stated that his appeal had been translated into Macedonian by an interpreter certified by the court to translate into Turkish, which suggested that the applicant's insistence on the use of Hebrew had been aimed at prolonging the proceedings. It further rejected his complaints about the use of evidence in the form of photocopies, stating that it had not been possible to admit it in original form as it had meanwhile been destroyed. 27. On 14 June 2006 the applicant submitted an appeal on points of law (барање за вонредно преиспитување на правосилна пресуда) to the Supreme Court in which he reiterated his complaints that he had been denied the right to use Hebrew, the only language of which he had sufficient command. He complained that the trial court, after being unable to secure the presence of a suitable interpreter, imposed the use of Serbian and other languages, even though it had established earlier in the proceedings that he could not use them proficiently. In this connection he complained about the rejection of his request to have an interpreter from abroad, even though Mr E.F. was an American Jew. He further complained that he had not been informed, in a language which he understood, of the nature and cause of the accusation. Lastly, he complained about the use of evidence in the form of photocopies. 28. On 16 January 2007 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant's appeal on points of law. It held that the proceedings had been conducted in a language which the applicant understood, relying on the depositions taken on 16 April 1998 in the pre-trial proceedings and the fact that all the evidence had been translated into Hebrew by Mr E.F. It also held that the applicant had had, throughout the entire proceedings, defence counsel of his own choosing. It further dismissed the remaining complaints finding no grounds for departing from the reasoning given by the lower courts. No information was provided as to the date of service of this decision. 29. On 27 June 2008 the President of the State granted the applicant early release from prison. 30. During the proceedings, the applicant requested, on several occasions, that the trial court and the State Judicial Council speed up the proceedings.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1
143,001-76491,ENG,AUT,CHAMBER,2006,CASE OF JURISIC AND COLLEGIUM MEHRERAU v. AUSTRIA,2,Violations of Art. 6-1;Not necessary to examine further complaint under Art. 6-1;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention and domestic proceedings,Christos Rozakis,"11. The second applicant wished to employ the first applicant as a farm hand. 12. On 6 February 1998 the applicants lodged a request with the Bregenz Labour Market Service (Arbeitsmarktservice) for the grant of an employment permit to the second applicant. They submitted that the first applicant, a national of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and his wife had been resident in Austria since November 1992. Both he and his wife had been granted residence permits (Aufenthaltsbewilligung) that were valid until December 1998. The applicants claimed that the first applicant had a right to take up employment in Austria. They referred in that connection to the Geneva Refugee Convention and the Association Agreement between the European Union and Turkey and submitted that those treaties had to be applied by analogy to their case. 13. On 19 March 1998 the Labour Market Service refused the request in accordance with s. 4(6) of the Employment of Aliens Act (Ausländerbeschäftigungsgesetz). It found that the maximum quota fixed for the employment of foreign workers in Vorarlberg had been exceeded and none of the conditions for making an exception under s. 4 (6) of the Act were met. 14. On 6 April 1998 the applicants appealed. They reiterated the arguments they had submitted before the Bregenz Labour Market Service. 15. On 25 May 1998 the Vorarlberg Labour Market Service rejected the first applicant’s appeal as inadmissible. It noted that only the second applicant as the proposed employer, not the first applicant, had the right to lodge a request for the grant of an employment permit. According to s. 21 of the Employment of Aliens Act an alien only became a party to proceedings concerning the issue of a work permit if his personal circumstances were relevant to the decision or if there was no employer. In the present case, however, neither of these conditions applied. In particular, the Bregenz Labour Market Service had based its decision exclusively on the situation of the labour market, and in particular the fact that the maximum quota for the employment of foreign workers had been exceeded. For that reason, the first applicant was not a party to the proceedings. 16. The Vorarlberg Labour Market Service further noted that only certain refugees – namely, those who had indefinite leave to remain, were married to an Austrian national or had a child of Austrian nationality – were exempted from the regulations of the Employment of Aliens Act. The first applicant did not fall into any of those categories. The Association Agreement between the European Union and Turkey was not applicable in the present case as the first applicant was not a Turkish national. 17. The Vorarlberg Labour Market Service went on to dismiss the second applicant’s appeal. It observed that the Bregenz Labour Market Service had proposed a replacement for the first applicant within the meaning of s. 4(2) and (3) of the Employment of Aliens Act, but he had not been taken on. In a telephone conversation the Labour Market Service had been informed by a representative of the second applicant that the proposed replacement had not been employed because the relevant post had already been filled. In further submissions the second applicant stated that the replacement had not complied with the requirements of the post. 18. The Vorarlberg Labour Market Service concluded that the second applicant had no further interest in employing the first applicant. It observed in particular that the second applicant had not given sufficient reasons as to why the proposed replacement could not work as a farm hand, a post which did not require any special qualification. It concluded that the second applicant was not interested in employing a replacement and dismissed the request for an employment permit under s. 4(1) of the Employment Act. It further noted that, in any event, the conditions for granting an employment permit had not been satisfied as the maximum quota fixed for the employment of foreign workers in Vorarlberg had been exceeded and none of the conditions for an exception under s. 4(6) of the above Act applied. 19. On 7 July 1998 the applicants filed a complaint with the Administrative Court and requested an oral hearing. They submitted that the Labour Market Service had not carried out sufficient investigations before reaching its findings. In particular, it had not heard evidence from the second applicant. They further denied that the second applicant had informed the Labour Market Service that the relevant post had been filled, and contested the maximum quota. 20. Referring to Article 17 of the Geneva Refugee Convention, the Association Agreement between the European Union and Turkey, Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the European Social Charter and Article 6 of the International Covenant for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the applicants submitted that the first applicant had a right to take up employment in Austria and had standing to join the proceedings. They also relied on Article 6 and Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. 21. They submitted that the first applicant had come to Austria as a Bosnian refugee, had resided there with his wife since 1992 and was in possession of a residence permit that was valid until December 1998. 22. On 15 December 1999 the Administrative Court rejected the first applicant’s complaint and dismissed the second applicant’s complaint. It found that none of the first applicant’s rights had been violated, as the refusal to grant the employment permit was not based on reasons related to the first applicant’s personal circumstances under s. 21 of the Employment of Aliens Act. 23. As to the second applicant’s complaint, it found that the Labour Market Service’s decision was coherent and conclusive. The Labour Market Service had based its decision essentially on the statements of the second applicant. There had, therefore, been no further need to hear representations from the second applicant. The Administrative Court concluded that the Labour Market Service had rightly refused to issue an employment permit under s. 4 (1) of the Employment of Aliens Act. It also decided that it was unnecessary to examine the second applicant’s further submissions questioning whether the maximum quota had been attained. 24. The Administrative Court further noted that the second applicant had never alleged that the first applicant was a refugee within the meaning of the Geneva Refugee Convention. As regards the reference to the European Social Charter and the International Covenant for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, it noted that those treaties were not directly applicable and so could not create any subjective rights. At most, they might be of assistance in interpreting the domestic legislation. However, having regard to the clear wording of s. 21 of the Employment of Aliens Act and the fact that there was no prospect of that provision being successfully challenged in the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof), as that court had already ruled that proceedings concerning a request for an employment permit under the Employment of Aliens Act did not concern a “civil right or obligation” within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention, the Administrative Court said that even the above mentioned interpretation would not lead to recognition of the first applicant’s legal standing in the proceedings concerning the grant of an employment permit. 25. It went on to note that the Association Agreement between the European Union and Turkey was not applicable as the first applicant was not Turkish. 26. In accordance with s. 39(2) of the Administrative Court Act (Verwaltungsgerichtshofgesetz), the Administrative Court dismissed the applicants’ request for a hearing as it found that an oral hearing was not likely to contribute to the clarification of the case. Referring to its case-law it further found that the proceedings did not concern a “civil right” within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention. The decision was served on the applicants’ counsel on 7 February 2000. 27. The second applicant was subsequently granted a permit to employ the first applicant from 14 July 2000 until 13 July 2001 and from 14 July 2001 until 13 July 2002. 28. In February 2002 the applicant’s wife became an Austrian citizen. Consequently, the Employment of Aliens Act is no longer applicable to the first applicant. 29. The Employment of Aliens Act (Ausländerbeschäftigungsgesetz) regulates an alien’s access to the Austrian labour market. The relevant parts of the Act at the material time were as follows: 30. Section 1 stated that the Act was not applicable inter alia to: - certain refugees who had indefinite leave to remain in Austria, who were married to an Austrian national or who had a child of Austrian nationality (s. 1(2)(a)); - aliens married to an Austrian national if they were in possession of a residence document (Aufenthaltstitel) within the meaning of the Act (s. 1(2)(1)); under the Aliens Act (Fremdengesetz) there are two types of residence document: residence permits (Aufenthaltsbewilligung) and settlement permits (Niederlassungsbewilligung). The relevant provisions of the Aliens Act make it easier for aliens married to an Austrian national to obtain a settlement permit. Under s. 3(8) of the Employment of Aliens Act the competent Regional Labour Office had to certify that the alien concerned fulfilled the requirements of s. 1(2)(l) before he could take up employment. 31. S. 3(1) and (2) of the Act laid down the principle that a proposed employer required an employment permit (Beschäftigungsbewilligung) if he wished to take on a foreign employee. Without such a permit the contract of employment between the employer and the foreign employee was null and void. However, while he was actually employed an alien hired without an employment permit had the same rights against his employer as he would have had if the contract of employment had been valid. If the lack of an employment permit was due to the employer’s negligence, the foreign employee further enjoyed all the rights to which he would have been entitled upon the termination of a valid employment relationship (s. 29). 32. S. 15 of the Act provided that a request could be made for an “exemption certificate” (Befreiungsschein) in respect of aliens who had been continuously legally employed within the meaning of the Act in Austria for at least five years during the previous eight, and for aliens who had been married to an Austrian national for at least five years and had their residence (Wohnsitz) in Austria. The exemption certificate subsequently relieved the alien or potential employer from the obligation to apply for an employment permit. S. 19 provided that the alien concerned could apply for an exemption certificate to the competent Regional Labour Market Service. 33. If an alien had been continuously legally employed within the meaning of the Act for at least 52 weeks in the previous 14 months, he was entitled to request a personal work permit (Arbeitserlaubnis) which was normally valid for one region only and could be restricted to certain kinds of employment (s. 14 (a)). 34. S. 19 provided that in order to obtain an employment permit the employer had to submit details of the proposed employment of the individual employee to the Regional Labour Market Service concerned. The application could be made by the alien only if there was no employer. 35. According to s. 4(1) an employment permit could only be granted if the situation and evolution of the labour market so allowed and important public or economic interests would not be harmed. Furthermore, specific conditions listed in s. 4(3) had to be fulfilled. 36. S. 4(b)(1) laid down that the situation and evolution of the labour market only allowed an employment permit to be granted in respect of a proposed foreign employee if there were no prior-ranking foreign job applicants. Prior-ranking foreign job applicants included aliens who were in possession of an exemption certificate within the meaning of s. 15 of the Act or who were in receipt of unemployment insurance payments (Arbeitslosenversicherung) (s. 4(b)(2) and (3)). 37. S. 4(c) provided that an employment permit had to be issued ex officio in respect of Turkish nationals falling within the relevant provisions of the Association Agreement between the European Union and Turkey. 38. Under s. 13(a) the Minister for Labour and Social Affairs could fix maximum quotas for the employment of aliens in a specific region (Landeshöchstzahl) for the following year. S. 4(6) provided that once the maximum quota had been exhausted, no further employment permits could be issued unless there were certain exceptional circumstances. 39. S. 21 provided that, in principle, the foreign job applicant was not a party to the proceedings concerning the issue of the employment permit. Exceptions were made where the personal circumstances of the alien were relevant to the decision or where there was no employer. 40. According to the settled case-law of the Constitutional Court and the Administrative Court a refusal to issue an employment permit under S. 4(1) and (6) of the Employment of Aliens Act could not violate a proposed foreign employee’s rights because he had no legal entitlement to the grant under that Act (see VfSlg 14.347/1995, VfSlg 13617/1993; and the Administrative Court’s decision of 16 November 1995, 94/09/0330). 41. The Constitutional Court and the Administrative Court have further held that the refusal of an employment permit to a proposed employer is not a decision concerning the employer’s “civil rights” (see, for example, VfSlg 13617/1993 and Administrative Court’s decision of 29 October 1997, 95/09/0254 with further references). 42. According to s. 39(1) of the Administrative Court Act, the Administrative Court must hold a hearing after its preliminary investigation of the case if a complainant so requests within the time-limit. S. 39(2) and (6) provides, however, that, notwithstanding such a request, the Administrative Court may decide not to hold a hearing if it is apparent from the written pleadings of the parties and the files relating to the previous proceedings that an oral hearing is unlikely to help clarify the case and that the lack of a hearing will not violate Article 6 of the Convention.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

UKRAINE,1,Violation of Art. 5-3;Violation of Art. 6-1;Violation of Art. 10;Pecuniary damage - financial award;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses (domestic proceedings) - claim dismissed,Antonella Mularoni,"10. The applicant is a Ukrainian national who was born in 1958 and currently resides in Donetsk. He is a lawyer practising in Ukraine. 11. On 31 July 1999 the Central Electoral Commission registered the applicant as the representative of a candidate for the presidency of Ukraine, Mr Olexander O. Moroz. The latter was the leader of the Socialist Party of Ukraine at the time. 12. On 31 October 1999 the Kyivsky District Prosecution Service of Donetsk (the “Kyivsky Prosecution Service”) conducted a criminal investigation into allegations that the applicant had interfered with the citizens' right to vote (Article 127 § 2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine – “the CC”). 13. On 1 November 1999 the applicant was apprehended for having disseminated false information about the alleged death of a presidential candidate, the incumbent President Mr Leonid D. Kuchma. The applicant had allegedly disseminated this information on 30 and 31 October 1999 in the form of a statement by the Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada (Parliament) published in a special nationwide issue of the Verkhovna Rada newspaper Holos Ukrayiny (газета “Голос України”). The text of the article disseminated by the applicant reads as follows: 14. Following the applicant's arrest, the Kyivsky Prosecution Service carried out a formal criminal investigation into the allegations made against him. 15. On 3 November 1999 the Kyivsky Prosecution Service decided to detain the applicant on suspicion of having committed a crime under Article 127 § 2 of the CC (see paragraph 41 below). The applicant was detained in the Temporary Investigative Isolation Unit of the Donetsk Region. He remained there until 10 November 1999. 16. On 5 November 1999 the applicant was formally charged with having committed an offence under Article 127 § 2 of the CC (see paragraph 41 below). The prosecution service classified his actions as having been committed by an official. 17. On 10 November 1999 the applicant lodged an application (dated 6 November 1999) with the Voroshylovsky District Court of Donetsk to be released from detention. On 17 November 1999 the court dismissed his application. 18. On 11 November 1999 the applicant was transferred to the Donetsk Investigative Detention Centre No. 5. 19. On 16 November 1999 the applicant underwent a medical examination. He was found to be suffering from bronchitis and second-degree hypertension. The medical commission recommended that the applicant be hospitalised. 20. On 22 November 1999 the Kyivsky Prosecution Service completed the pre-trial investigation into the applicant's case and committed him for trial. 21. On 25 November 1999 the case file was transferred to the court. On 10 December 1999 the Kuybyshevsky District Court of Donetsk (the District Court”) committed the applicant to stand trial on charges of interference with the citizens' right to vote, contrary to Article 127 § 2 of the CC (see paragraph 41 below). It also decided not to release him from detention. 22. In the course of the trial Judge T. of the District Court on 7 March 2000 passed a resolution (постанову) ordering He also requested the prosecution to reconsider the preventive measure of detention applied in respect of the applicant and to reclassify the charges against him. In particular, he stated: 23. On 30 March 2000 the deputy prosecutor of the Donetsk Region lodged a protest with the Presidium of the Donetsk Regional Court (“the Presidium”) against the resolution of 7 March 2000 and requested the initiation of supervisory review proceedings in the applicant's case. He also sought to set aside the resolution of 7 March 2000 in which the case had been remitted for additional investigation. The deputy prosecutor considered that there was sufficient evidence to corroborate the applicant's interference with the citizens' right to vote (Article 127 § 2 of the CC). On the same date the registry of the court acknowledged receipt of the protest. 24. On 5 April 2000 the Presidium, composed of its President, L.V.I., and the judges R.L.P., P.L.V., R.L.I., M.M.I. and B.A.M., in the presence of a prosecutor, quashed the resolution of 7 March 2000 and remitted the case for further judicial consideration. In particular, the Presidium found that the District Court had remitted the case back for additional investigation without a thorough examination of the indictment and of the requisite actus rea and mens rea of the offence with which the applicant had been charged. It had also not mentioned which particular investigative measures the prosecution was required to take. The Presidium decided not to release the applicant from detention. In particular, it stated: 25. On 24 April 2000 the District Court dismissed a petition filed by the applicant's lawyer requesting that the case be remitted for additional investigation. It also dismissed the applicant's application for release from detention. 26. On 1 June 2000 the District Court dismissed a further application for the applicant's release. 27. On 16 June 2000 the District Court changed the preventive measure applied in respect of the applicant to an undertaking not to abscond. 28. On 6 July 2000 the District Court, chaired by Judge T., who had heard the case on 7 March 2000, convicted the applicant of interfering with the citizens' right to vote for the purpose of influencing election results by means of fraudulent behaviour. The District Court sentenced the applicant to five years' imprisonment, which was suspended for a two-year probationary period as the actions of Mr Salov “in fact entailed no grave consequences”. It also ordered the applicant to pay a fine of 170 Ukrainian hryvnyas (UAH). It held as follows: 29. On 15 September 2000 the Donetsk Regional Court, composed of the judges D.A.D., G.G. and D.A.V., upheld the judgment of 6 July 2000. 30. On 3 November 2000 and 9 February 2001 respectively the Regional Court and the Supreme Court of Ukraine dismissed, as being unsubstantiated, the applicant's complaints and his request for a supervisory review of his conviction. 31. On 22 November 2000 the Donetsk Lawyers' Qualifications and Disciplinary Commission annulled the applicant's licence to practise as a lawyer (no. 1051, issued on 17 December 1997). It based its decision on the applicant's conviction of 6 June 2000. 32. On 23 April 2004 the applicant received a new licence to practise as a lawyer (no. 1572), after passing an examination before the Donetsk Lawyers' Qualifications and Disciplinary Commission and paying the sum of UAH 1,200. He was allowed to sit exams after the legal effects of his conviction were annulled (погашена судимість). 33. In July 2000 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Voroshylovsky District Court of Donetsk against the prosecution service of Donetsk and the Donetsk Regional Department of the Ministry of the Interior, claiming compensation for the non-pecuniary and pecuniary damage resulting from his unlawful 10-day detention in 1999 in the Temporary Investigative Isolation Unit (Ізолятор Тимчасового Утримання). In particular, it was contended that he should have been held in the Investigative Detention Centre (Слідчий Ізолятор) and not in the Temporary Investigative Isolation Unit, as his status had been that of a suspect in criminal proceedings. 34. On 15 June 2001 the Voroshylovsky District Court of Donetsk allowed his claims in part. It also ordered the prosecution service of Donetsk and the Donetsk Regional Department of the Ministry of the Interior to pay UAH 3,000 (EUR 500) to the applicant. 35. On 22 November 2001 the Donetsk Regional Court of Appeal decided that the State Treasury, and not the prosecution service or the Ministry of the Interior, was liable for compensating the applicant. It therefore ordered the Donetsk Regional State Treasury Department to pay the applicant UAH 3,000 (EUR 500) in compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. 36. The applicant alleges that this compensation was not paid to him. 37. The relevant provisions of the Constitution of Ukraine read as follows: 38. The relevant provisions of the Judiciary Act of 5 June 1981, with subsequent changes and amendments, as in force at the material time, read as follows: 39. Section 7 of this Act provides that any citizen of Ukraine who has attained the age of twenty-one and has a minimum of two years' legal experience may become a judge. By section 9(3), judges are appointed for a maximum initial period of five years, following an examination by the judicial qualifications commission and a decision of the relevant local authority. In accordance with sections 33 and 34 of the Act, a judge of the district court may be subject to disciplinary investigation on the basis of a request by the President of the regional court. 40. By sections 6 and 7 of this Act, the qualifications commissions had the power to institute disciplinary proceedings, and to submit conclusions on the feasibility of appointing a candidate for a position as a district-court judge and on the renewal of the judicial term of a judge elected for an initial period of five years. They could also request an attestation for a judge proposed for a promotion in judicial or administrative rank within the court, or an assessment of his legal knowledge. The presidents of the regional courts could request the qualifications commissions to certify or assess judges' knowledge and qualifications. In accordance with sections 32 and 33 of the Act, the presidents of the higher courts were allowed to request the institution of disciplinary proceedings against judges of the district courts. 41. The relevant provisions of Article 127 of the Criminal Code read as follows: 42. The relevant provisions of the Code of Administrative Offences read as follows: 43. The relevant provisions of Section III, Chapter 23, of the Code of Criminal Procedure read as follows: 44. The relevant provisions of Chapter 31 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provide as follows: 45. The relevant provisions of the Presidential Elections Act read as follows: 46. The relevant provisions of the reservation contained in the instrument of ratification are set out in the judgment of Nevmerzhitsky v. Ukraine (no. 54825/00, § 56, 5 April 2005). 47. The relevant transitional provisions of the Constitution of Ukraine are set out in the Nevmerzhitsky judgment cited above. 48. The relevant resolution of the Plenary Supreme Court of Ukraine reads as follows: 49. In its decision the Constitutional Court found that the Cabinet of Ministers had acted unconstitutionally in passing the resolution of 22 March 1999 (no. 432) that reduced the expenditure of the 1999 State budget on the needs of: the Supreme Court by 40%, the regional courts by 7.5%, the district (and city) courts by 6.8%, the Higher Arbitration Court by 26.4%, the arbitration courts by 19.4%, and the military courts by 15.5%. According to the information issued by the Ministry of Justice (responsible for the courts' administration at the material time), this expenditure covered 51.6% of the needs of the first-instance courts and 62.8% of the needs of the regional courts. The Constitutional Court found that Resolution no. 432 exerted financial influence on the courts and infringed the citizens' right to judicial protection. 50. The Council of Judges, in its Decision no. 13 of 12 December 2000, found that the existing procedure for the selection and appointment of candidates for judicial posts, as established by the Ministry of Justice, Higher Council of Justice and the judicial qualifications commissions, was not compatible with the need to form a highly qualified judiciary able to administer justice effectively and independently. 51. On 12 December 2000 the Council of Judges adopted Resolution no. 10, finding that the decisions of the Cabinet of Ministers to lower judicial salaries were contrary to the principle of the independence of the judiciary.","['10', '5', '6']","['5-3', '6-1']",[],[],[],[],1
145,001-57753,ENG,AUT,CHAMBER,1992,CASE OF PFEIFER AND PLANKL v. AUSTRIA,2,Preliminary objection rejected (non-exhaustion);Violation of Art. 6-1;Violation of Art. 8;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses award - domestic proceedings;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings,N. Valticos,"6. Mr Heinrich Pfeifer and Mrs Margit Plankl, both Austrian citizens, were detained on remand in 1982 in connection with separate criminal proceedings brought against them before the Klagenfurt Regional Court (Landesgericht, ""the Regional Court""). The present case is not concerned with the proceedings against the second applicant. 7. On 12 November 1982 Judge Kaiser, an investigating judge at the said court, issued a warrant for Mr Pfeifer’s arrest. He was suspected of having committed various offences, including aggravated fraud, professional burglary, forgery and suppression of documents, receiving stolen goods and unlawful possession of firearms. The reasons cited by the judge in support of his detention were the danger of his absconding and the risks of collusion and repetition of offences (Article 175 (1), sub-paragraphs 2 to 4, of the Code of Criminal Procedure). 8. Mr Pfeifer was arrested in Klagenfurt on 20 November 1982. On the next day he was brought before Judge Arnold, the duty judge (Journalrichter, Article 179 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure), who informed him of the reasons for his arrest. On being questioned in the absence of his lawyer, he admitted unlawful possession of firearms, but denied having committed any other offence. The judge remanded him in custody. 9. Also on 21 November 1982 Judge Kaiser ordered the applicant’s transfer to Vienna, where the Regional Criminal Court (Landesgericht für Strafsachen) had on 20 November issued a warrant for his arrest on suspicion of having taken part in an armed robbery in Vienna. The Klagenfurt proceedings were joined to those instituted in Vienna, and Mr Pfeifer remained in the Vienna remand prison from 22 November 1982 to 24 February 1983. 10. The proceedings were severed on 20 January 1983 and the Klagenfurt Regional Court recovered jurisdiction over the proceedings which are the subject of the present case. The case was assigned to Judge Startinig, who on 25 February 1983 opened a judicial investigation (Voruntersuchung) and ordered the applicant’s detention to be continued (Article 180 (1) and (2), sub-paragraphs 1 to 3, of the Code of Criminal Procedure). The Graz Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht) twice authorised the extension of his detention on remand, for a maximum period of ten months in all. 11. On 23 May 1983 Mr Pfeifer challenged the investigating judge, alleging bias, but on 26 May the challenge was held to be unsubstantiated by the President of the Regional Court. On 30 June the applicant brought a criminal complaint against Mr Startinig for abuse of public powers, on the ground that he had refused to allow a visit by Mr Peters (see paragraphs 2 and 5 above). As the public prosecutor’s office had decided not to bring a prosecution, Mr Pfeifer brought an alternative private prosecution himself (Subsidiaranklage, see paragraph 14 below). 12. In the main proceedings, counsel for Mr Pfeifer had submitted a memorial on 21 June 1983. On 19 July the public prosecutor filed an indictment, in which the only charges were receiving stolen goods and illegal possession of firearms. An objection (Einspruch) by the applicant against this indictment was dismissed by the Graz Court of Appeal on 18 August 1983. 13. Mr Pfeifer was sent for trial before the Regional Court, composed of two professional judges, Mr Kaiser (the presiding judge) and Mr Arnold, and two lay assessors (Schöffen). On 31 August 1983, Judge Kaiser summoned him to inform him that he had acted as investigating judge in the case until 31 December 1982 (see paragraphs 7 and 9 above) and was accordingly prevented from sitting in the trial under Article 68 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In the course of the interview Mr Pfeifer waived his right to lodge a plea of nullity on this ground (Article 281 (1), first sentence, of the Code; see paragraphs 22 and 24 below). On 1 September 1983, the presiding judge informed him that Judge Arnold was also disqualified under Article 68 (2), since he had, as duty judge, questioned him on 21 November 1982 (see paragraph 8 above). Mr Pfeifer likewise waived his right to lodge a plea of nullity on this point. In both cases, the relevant records were signed by him in the absence of his counsel, who had not been summoned on that occasion; the applicant had stated that he did not think it necessary to consult him. 14. The hearings took place on 16 September and 7 October 1983 with the participation of the two above-mentioned judges. Defence counsel did not object to the composition of the Regional Court or challenge Judges Kaiser and Arnold. Neither did he draw the court’s attention, at the hearing of 7 October 1983, to the fact that, in the criminal proceedings instituted against Judge Startinig, the third investigating judge (see paragraph 11 above), the applicant had on 23 September 1983 challenged all the judges of the Klagenfurt Regional Court, including Judges Kaiser and Arnold. This challenge was eventually allowed by the Graz Court of Appeal on 10 November 1983, the judges concerned having declared themselves disqualified. The case was therefore referred to the Leoben Regional Court and later discontinued. 15. Also on 7 October 1983, the court convicted Mr Pfeifer of aggravated receiving of stolen goods (Article 164 (3) of the Criminal Code) and unlawful possession of firearms (section 36 of the Firearms Law, Waffengesetz) and sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment. 16. The applicant lodged a plea of nullity (Nichtigkeitsbeschwerde) and an appeal against sentence (Berufung), which were dismissed by the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof) on 29 February 1984. On the plea of nullity, the court observed that the defence had not raised at the proper time the issue of the participation of Judges Kaiser and Arnold, who had been challenged in earlier proceedings, otherwise the Regional Court would have been obliged to give an interlocutory decision. The fact that the challenge relating to the other case was subsequently allowed (see paragraph 14 above) did not justify the conclusion that the two professional judges were also biased in the criminal proceedings against Mr Pfeifer. Furthermore, the latter could no longer argue that Judges Kaiser and Arnold should in principle have withdrawn under Article 68 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 22 below), because prior to the trial he had expressly waived his right to challenge them on this ground. The Supreme Court also confirmed the sentence. 17. During their detention on remand the applicants corresponded with each other. In the early summer of 1983, the investigating judge censored a letter from Mrs Plankl to Mr Pfeifer by crossing out and making illegible certain passages. They were not reconstructed in the national proceedings, but their content was said to have been as follows (translation): ""I wonder whether there is anybody left in this monkey house who is still normal ... In life they are nobodies, here they think they are gods. Some of the officers are guests like us. They are always spying on the women, these monkeys are proper peeping toms! I hate it!"" 18. Mrs Plankl complained to the Review Chamber (Ratskammer) of the Regional Court. She claimed that the form of censorship used was unlawful, since Article 187 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure authorised the stopping of letters, but not making them illegible. Besides, it allowed censorship only in respect of letters likely to interfere with the purpose of detention, or giving rise to the suspicion of a criminal offence where the offender could be prosecuted ex officio, with or without the victim’s authorisation. The relevant passages contained remarks critical of prison officers but were not, in her opinion, such as to fall within the scope of the above rules. 19. The complaint was considered in camera in the absence of the applicant and her counsel. After hearing the prosecution and studying a report by the investigating judge, the Review Chamber rejected her complaint on 26 July 1983. The crossing out of part of a letter was in its opinion a less severe measure than stopping the letter. It was therefore within the investigating judge’s powers under Article 187 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 25 below), and did not infringe Mrs Plankl’s rights. It had moreover been justified, because the passages in question, described in the report as ""jokes of an insulting nature against prison officers"", had constituted defamation (üble Nachrede) of officials in the exercise of their duty (Article 111 (1) in conjunction with Article 117 (2) of the Criminal Code), an offence capable of justifying a censorship measure under Article 187 (2). 20. After the Commission had communicated the application to the Austrian Government, the Attorney-General’s Office (Generalprokuratur) brought a plea of nullity for the preservation of the law (Nichtigkeitsbeschwerde zur Wahrung des Gesetzes) before the Supreme Court. Two grounds of appeal were submitted. It was argued, firstly, that the rendering illegible (Unleserlichmachen) of certain passages and the Review Chamber’s decision thereon were not covered by Article 187 (2). Under that provision all letters from a person detained on remand to a private individual had to be stopped if they gave rise to the suspicion of a criminal offence subject to public prosecution ex officio (von Amts wegen). This was not the case with the passages in question. If they were to be regarded as an offence under Articles 111 (1) or 115 (1) of the Criminal Code, in principle only the victim could act, and public prosecution (with the victim’s authorisation and that of his superior authority) under Article 117 (2) of the Criminal Code was possible only if the insults were made ""person to person"" and not if they were in a letter. Secondly, Article 187 (2) authorised only the stopping of letters, not the deletion of specific passages. 21. On 20 October 1987, after a public hearing, the Supreme Court dismissed the first ground of appeal but upheld the second. (a) On the assumption that the passages in issue contained ""jokes of an insulting nature against prison officers"", the court considered that there were grounds for suspecting the applicant of insulting behaviour (Beleidigung - Article 115 of the Criminal Code) rather than defamation (Article 111). Such an offence, if committed against an official in the exercise of his duty, required public prosecution with the victim’s authorisation (Article 117 (2) of the Criminal Code, see paragraph 26 below). In the present case, the offence resulted from the handing over by Mrs Plankl of an unsealed letter to a prison officer for the purpose of transmitting it to the investigating judge. It had thus been possible for the letter’s content to become known to several prison or court officers in the exercise of their duty. Article 117 (2) of the Criminal Code being applicable, the measure in question was covered by Article 187 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. (b) The investigating judge and the Review Chamber had, however, misapplied this provision, which authorised the stopping of letters but not the deletion of passages from them. The investigating judge had in fact not taken a ""less severe measure"" under an implied power, but a different measure which interfered with the interests of the prosecution authorities and the prison officers concerned, as they had the possibility of bringing criminal proceedings against Mrs Plankl on account of her remarks in the letter. The law had been violated in this latter respect, but Mrs Plankl had not been injured thereby and could therefore not complain of the dismissal of her complaint by the Review Chamber. 22. According to Article 68 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure: ""A person shall be disqualified from participating or deciding in the trial proceedings if he has acted as investigating judge in the same case ..."" 23. The following provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure govern the disqualification (Ausschliessung) of judges: ""A judge is obliged to bring circumstances which disqualify him to the immediate attention of the president of the court of which he is a member ..."" ""From the moment when grounds for his disqualification come to his knowledge, every judicial officer (Gerichtsperson) shall refrain from all judicial acts, on pain of nullity of such acts. The judicial officer concerned may carry out judicial acts which are urgent, but only where there is danger in delay and if another judge or registrar cannot be appointed immediately ..."" 24. Furthermore, under Article 72 the parties to the proceedings may challenge (ablehnen) a judge if they can show that there are reasons for doubting his complete impartiality. Although Article 72 refers expressly to grounds other than disqualification, it is the practice of the courts to apply Article 72 also in cases where a party raises an issue relating to a judge’s disqualification. In fact, the disqualification of a first-instance judge cannot subsequently be pleaded in nullity proceedings unless he was challenged before or at the trial or immediately after the ground for disqualification became known to the party (Article 281 (1), sub-paragraph 1, of the Code of Criminal Procedure). The procedure applicable in this respect is the following: ""An application by a party to challenge a judge shall be submitted to the court of which the person challenged is a member or declared orally before the registrar, at any time but not later than twenty-four hours before the start of the hearing in the case of a challenge to a member of the trial court, and not later than three days after service of the summons to appear at the hearing in the case of a challenge to the whole court. In the application the grounds of challenge must be stated precisely and, as far as possible, supported by evidence."" 25. The control of correspondence of remand prisoners is governed by Article 187 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides: ""(1) Remand prisoners may ... correspond in writing with all persons, provided that there is no danger that such persons may interfere with the purpose of the detention ... (2) ... Letters from detainees which give rise to the suspicion that an offence, not being an offence which can be prosecuted only at the request of a person concerned, is being committed by means of them, are always to be stopped, unless they are addressed to a national general representative body, a national court or other national authority, or to the European Commission of Human Rights. (3) ..."" Decisions concerning the persons with whom the detainee may correspond and the surveillance of correspondence are the responsibility of the investigating judge. A complaint against such a decision lies with the Review Chamber of the Regional Court (Article 188 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). 26. For the purposes of Article 187 (2), public prosecution offences (Offizyialdelikte) may justify the stopping of a letter, whereas private prosecution offences (Privatanklagedelikte) may not. In addition, it follows from the Supreme Court judgment of 20 October 1987 (see paragraph 21 above) that such measures may also be justified in the case of offences qualifying for public prosecution with the authorisation of the injured party (Ermächtigungsdelikte), for instance offences committed against officials in the exercise of their duty. In this latter respect Article 117 (2) of the Criminal Code provides: ""Where an offence against honour is committed against an official ... during the exercise of his duties ..., the public prosecutor shall, with the authorisation of the injured party and his superior authority, institute proceedings within the time-limit which would otherwise be available to the injured party for the lodging of a request for prosecution. The same shall apply where such an offence against [an official] in connection with one of his professional activities is committed in a printed publication, in a broadcast, or in some other manner whereby it becomes accessible to the general public.""","['6', '8']",['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

RUSSIA,4,Violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading treatment;Inhuman treatment) (Substantive aspect),Anatoly Kovler;Elisabeth Steiner;Erik Møse;Julia Laffranque;Khanlar Hajiyev;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen,"5. The applicant was born in 1973 and is serving a prison sentence in the Altai Region. 6. On 5 October 2001 the applicant was arrested and charged with several offences, including murder and robbery. 7. On 7 August 2002 the Altai Regional Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to twenty-two years’ imprisonment. On 26 February 2003 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation quashed the judgment of 7 August 2002 on appeal and remitted the matter for fresh consideration. 8. On 3 November 2003 the Altai Regional Court, on the basis of a jury verdict, found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to twentyone years’ imprisonment. 9. The applicant appealed and on 12 May 2004 the Supreme Court upheld the judgment of 3 November 2003 in substance. The applicant was not represented by a lawyer. 10. On 24 October 2007 the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation quashed, by way of supervisory review, the judgment of 12 May 2004 and remitted the matter for fresh consideration to the appellate court. The court noted that the absence of legal representation infringed the applicant’s defence rights. 11. On 25 January 2008 the Supreme Court upheld the applicant’s conviction in substance, but reduced his sentence to twenty years’ imprisonment. The applicant was represented by a State-appointed lawyer. 12. The applicant was detained in remand prison no. IZ-22/1 in Barnaul pending investigation and trial from 27 October 2001 to 27 June 2004. On numerous occasions he was transferred to a temporary detention facility in Barnaul or remand prison no. IZ-74/1 in Chelyabinsk in connection with the criminal proceedings against him. 13. On 27 June 2004 the applicant was transferred to correctional colony no. IK-10 in Rubtsovsk to serve the prison sentence there. 14. On 17 August 2004 the applicant was returned to remand prison no. IZ-22/1 in Barnaul in connection with the proceedings unrelated to the present case. He remained there until 7 August 2005. 15. On 7 August 2005 the applicant was transported to correctional colony no. IK-10 in Rubtsovsk where he continued to serve the prison sentence until 28 June 2006. 16. It appears that the applicant lodged several complaints in connection with the criminal proceedings against him and on 29 June 2006 he was transferred back to remand prison no. IZ-22/1 in Barnaul in order for him to participate in the court hearings. 17. On 20 December 2007 the applicant was transferred to remand prison no. IZ-77/1 in Chelyabinsk to ensure his participation in the appeal hearing at the Supreme Court of Russia by means of a video link. On 13 February 2008 the applicant was returned to remand prison no. IZ-22/1 in Barnaul. 18. On 13 May 2008 the applicant was transported to correctional colony no. IK-10 to serve the prison sentence. 19. In 2008-2009, for reasons unknown the applicant was detained in remand prison no. IZ-22/1 in Barnaul from 28 May to 29 June and from 3 August to 8 September 2008 and from 13 to 28 April 2009. 20. The Government provided the following information as regards the cell numbers, surface area and population related to the applicant’s stay in remand prison no. IZ-22/1: 21. At all times the applicant was provided with an individual sleeping place and bedding. He received two bed sheets, a pillow case, two towels, a blanket, a mattress, a pillow, a spoon and a mug. The temperature in the cells was between +180C and + 250C. The heating system functioned properly. All cells in the remand prison were equipped with mandatory ventilation in good working order. In addition, the windows were equipped with vents to ensure natural ventilation of the premises. All cells had a sink, a water tap and a toilet which was separated by a 0.7-m partition from the living area. The dining table was located about 1.5 m away from the toilet. Window panes were installed for the winter. There were no gaps in the window frames. The applicant could take at least one shower per week for at least fifteen minutes. The inmates were also provided with water-heating devices and sinks for their laundry. During the day the lighting was on from 6 am to 10 pm. At night lower-voltage bulbs were used to maintain lighting in the lavatory. The cells were disinfected at least once every three months. No parasites or rodents were detected in the cells where the applicant was detained. The applicant was provided with three meals a day. All the food was subjected to quality checks. 22. According to the applicant, upon arrival at the remand prison he was placed in cell no. 78. The cell measured twenty-five square metres and housed fifteen inmates. There were not enough beds and the inmates took turns to sleep. The toilet was not separated from the living area of the cell. The lighting was not sufficient. The cell was infested with bed bugs. No bed sheets, pillows or blankets were provided. There were only old and dirty mattresses. 23. From October to December 2003 the applicant was held in cell no. 41. The cell measured ten square metres and housed thirteen to fifteen inmates. Sometimes their number reduced to nine or ten. The toilet was elevated from the floor by 0.6 metres and afforded no privacy. The dining table was about 0.8 metres away from the toilet. There was no sink and inmates had to wash themselves over the toilet. There were six bunk beds. Because of wide gaps around the windows the cell was very cold in the winter. The lighting was insufficient. The mattresses were old and smelly. No bed sheets, pillows or blankets were provided. There were no more than six mugs, cups and spoons. The cell was infested with lice, bed bugs and cockroaches. It was not ventilated. The remand centre organised one laundry day per month. The inmates were allowed to submit to the laundry only bed-sheets, pillow cases and blankets received from their relatives. No other items were accepted. Medicine was rarely prescribed. The cell was not disinfected. The food was of poor quality. The newly arrived detainees underwent a medical examination only five days after their arrival. As a result, inmates suffering from tuberculosis, syphilis, gonorrhoea, scabies and fungal infections, and HIV-positive detainees, were on several occasions placed in the cell where the applicant was detained. 24. On an unspecified date the applicant was placed in a different cell while cell no. 41 was being renovated. On several occasions he was transferred to other cells. The conditions of detention, however, remained unchanged. In December 2004 the applicant was returned to the same cell, which was assigned a new number, no. 39. He was detained there until 7 August 2005. 25. The walls in the cell had been repainted and there were only four bunk beds left. However, at the relevant time there were nine inmates in the cell. A sink had been installed. The toilet had been separated from the living area by a metal partition. Despite the separation, the person using the toilet could still be seen by the inmates. Ventilation had been installed, but it was constantly out of order. Bed sheets and pillow cases were provided only once, allegedly before an inspection of the remand centre. 26. As regards the conditions of his detention between 29 June 2006 and 28 April 2009, in his submissions sent to the Court on 30 June 2010 the applicant indicated that at no time was he afforded more than three square metres of personal space. 27. Section 23 of the Detention of Suspects Act of 15 July 1995 provides that detainees should be kept in conditions which satisfy sanitary and hygienic requirements. They should be provided with an individual sleeping place and given bedding, tableware and toiletries. Each inmate should have no less than four square metres of personal space in his or her cell. 29. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) visited the Russian Federation from 2 to 17 December 2001. The section of its Report to the Russian Government (CPT/Inf (2003) 30) dealing with the conditions of detention in remand establishments and the complaints procedure read as follows: “45. It should be stressed at the outset that the CPT was pleased to note the progress being made on an issue of great concern for the Russian penitentiary system: overcrowding. When the CPT first visited the Russian Federation in November 1998, overcrowding was identified as the most important and urgent challenge facing the prison system. At the beginning of the 2001 visit, the delegation was informed that the remand prison population had decreased by 30,000 since 1 January 2000. An example of that trend was SIZO No 1 in Vladivostok, which had registered a 30% decrease in the remand prison population over a period of three years. ... The CPT welcomes the measures taken in recent years by the Russian authorities to address the problem of overcrowding, including instructions issued by the Prosecutor General’s Office, aimed at a more selective use of the preventive measure of remand in custody. Nevertheless, the information gathered by the Committee’s delegation shows that much remains to be done. In particular, overcrowding is still rampant and regime activities are underdeveloped. In this respect, the CPT reiterates the recommendations made in its previous reports (cf. paragraphs 25 and 30 of the report on the 1998 visit, CPT (99) 26; paragraphs 48 and 50 of the report on the 1999 visit, CPT (2000) 7; paragraph 52 of the report on the 2000 visit, CPT (2001) 2).”",['3'],[],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1969 and is currently serving a prison sentence in a correctional colony in the Rostov Region. 6. On 26 February 1998 the prosecutor opened a criminal investigation against the applicant. 7. On 3 March 1998 the applicant was arrested and detained in custody on suspicion of kidnapping and fraud. On 13 March 1998 he was released on bail. However, the applicant fled from the investigative authorities and re-offended. 8. On 5 May 1999 the applicant was again arrested. Shortly afterwards, on 18 May 1999 he was detained on remand. 9. On 22 May 1999 the applicant was charged under Articles 139 § 3, 126 § 3 and 163 § 3 of the Criminal Code with unlawful entry into a home, kidnapping and extortion. He was subsequently charged under Articles 127 § 3, 158 § 3, 159 § 3, 161 § 3, 162 § 3, 325 § 2 and 327 § 1 of the Criminal Code with illegal deprivation of liberty, theft, fraud, robbery, stealing and forgery of official documents. 10. On 14 July, 7 September, 16 September and 30 November 1999 the Prosecutor of the Rostov Region extended the applicant’s detention until 24 September, 15 November, 18 December 1999 and 24 March 2000 respectively. Each time, consideration was given to the applicant’s criminal record, the gravity of the charges against him and his active role in a gang. 11. On 20 March 2000 the case against the applicant was sent to the Rostov Regional Court for trial. 12. On 29 March 2000 the Rostov Regional Court scheduled the opening date of the trial and ordered that the preventive measure in respect of the applicant and his co-defendants “should remain unchanged” in accordance with Articles 222, 223 and 230 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure. 13. On 13 June 2000 the Rostov Regional Court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to twelve years’ imprisonment. On 2 November 2000, however, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation quashed the judgment on appeal and remitted the case for a retrial. The Supreme Court held that the preventive measure applied to the applicant “should remain unchanged”. 14. On 1 December 2000 the Rostov Regional Court scheduled the new trial hearing and ordered that the preventive measure “should remain unchanged”. 15. On 14 May 2001 the Rostov Regional Court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to sixteen years’ imprisonment, but on 16 January 2002 the Supreme Court quashed the conviction on appeal and remitted the case for a retrial. The Supreme Court held that the preventive measure applied to the applicant “should remain unchanged”. 16. On 12 February 2002 the Rostov Regional Court listed the new trial hearing for 27 February 2002 and ordered that the preventive measure applied to the applicant “should remain unchanged”. 17. On 1 July 2002 the Rostov Regional Court extended the applicant’s detention until 1 October 2002. It found as follows: “The defendants [the applicant and four other persons] are charged with kidnapping, illegal deprivation of liberty, burglary and other crimes. They have been in custody: ..., [the applicant] – since 15 May 1999, ... . The Prosecutor requested that the defendants’ detention be extended by 3 months. Having examined the Prosecutor’s request, having heard the parties to the proceedings, the court considers it necessary to extend the defendants’ detention by 3 months, that is, until 1 October 2002 inclusive, because they are charged with serious and particularly serious criminal offences. Under Articles 255, 256 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, the defendants’ detention on remand is extended by 3 (three) months, that is, from 1 July 2002 to 1 October 2002.” 18. On 6 November 2002 the Supreme Court of Russia upheld the extension order, finding that it was sufficiently justified. 19. On 1 October and 31 December 2002 and 31 March, 26 June, 25 September and 15 December 2003 the Rostov Regional Court extended the applicant’s detention until 1 January, 31 March, 30 June, 26 September, 25 December 2003 and 15 March 2004 respectively. The wording of the above decisions was identical to that applied in the decision of 1 July 2002. 20. The applicant appealed against each of the above extension orders to the Supreme Court arguing that the extension orders were not sufficiently reasoned and that the court had not taken into consideration his individual situation. On 12 February, 14 May, 16 July, 16 October and 24 December 2003 and 31 March 2004 respectively, the Supreme Court of Russia upheld the above decisions on appeal. 21. In the meantime, on 19 February 2004 the Rostov Regional Court, composed of presiding judge Mr Zh. and lay judges Ms S. and Ms M., extended the applicant’ detention until 19 May 2004. The court used the same stereotyped wording and referred to the seriousness of the charges against the applicant. The applicant again appealed against the extension to the Supreme Court. 22. On 10 March 2005, that is after the applicant’s conviction by the Regional Court (see paragraph 24 below), the Supreme Court of Russia discontinued the examination of the applicant’s appeal because he had been convicted in the meantime by the Regional Court. 23. As regards the trial proceedings in the period from 27 February 2002 to 25 February 2004, the case was adjourned on over fifty occasions: at the request of the applicant and his co-defendants, who wished to study the case file or the records of the hearings; at the requests of the applicant and his co-defendants for the replacement of their representatives and the need for the newly appointed representatives to study the case file; due to the illness of the representatives and their failure to appear before the court, and due to the illness of the applicant and co-defendants or following their complaints concerning their health. On one occasion the hearing was adjourned due to the failure of the authorities to transport the defendants to the courtroom. 24. On 17 May 2004 the Regional Court, composed of presiding judge Mr Zh. and lay judges Ms S. and Ms M., found the applicant guilty of multiple counts of fraud, multiple counts of kidnapping and illegal deprivation of liberty, extortion, theft and burglary and sentenced him to thirteen years’ imprisonment. 25. The applicant lodged an appeal. He claimed, inter alia, that the lay judges had unlawfully sat on the bench. The law had been changed and after 1 January 2004 the lay judges were no longer permitted to take part in the administration of justice. 26. On 10 March 2005 the Supreme Court of Russia comprising three judges upheld the judgment on appeal. One of the judges of the Supreme Court had previously examined the applicant’s case on appeal on 2 November 2000 (see paragraph 13 above) and had also examined, on 16 October 2003, the appeal against the decision of 26 June 2003 to extend the applicant’s detention until 26 September 2003 (see paragraphs 19-20 above). One other judge had previously examined the applicant’s case on appeal on 16 January 2002 (see paragraph 15 above). As to the applicant’s allegation about the allegedly unlawful composition of the tribunal, the court found that the trial had begun before 1 January 2004 and that the participation of two lay judges in the determination of the criminal charge against him had been in accordance with the principle of continuity of the trial. 27. From 7 July 1999 to 23 April 2005 the applicant was held in detention facility IZ-61/1 of Rostov-on-Don (Учреждение ИЗ-61/1 г. Ростова-на-Дону УИН МЮ РФ). Throughout this period the applicant was held in thirteen different cells. 28. According to the Government’s observations of 31 January 2008, the cells where the applicant was held measured from 6.6 square metres (the punishment cell) to 54.5 square metres, and provided an average space of between three and four square metres per person. The design capacity of the cells was not exceeded. 29. Windows in the cells were covered with metal screens (жалюзийные решетки), which were removed in December 2002. The cells were illuminated with 60-75 watt filament lamps (from two to four lamps per cell depending on the size of the cell), which were on from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. At night time the cells were lit by 60-75 watt security lights with tinted glass shades. 30. All cells were ventilated by a system of exhaust ventilation. Natural ventilation through windows was also available. The cells were equipped with a heating system providing an adequate temperature in line with sanitary norms. The average temperature during the summer was maintained at 22 degrees Celsius, and during winter at 18 degrees Celsius. 31. The cells were equipped with wash basins, cold and hot water taps and lavatory pans elevated 35 cm above the floor and separated from the main area by a two-metre-high brick partition. The arrangement of lavatory pans assured the detainees privacy when using them. 32. The cells were equipped with potable water tanks. The quality of the drinking water was regularly checked by the facility’s medical staff. 33. In each cell the applicant had an individual bed and was provided with bedding (a mattress, a blanket, a pillow, two bed sheets and a pillow-slip) and towels. 34. The cells were also equipped with dining tables and benches corresponding to the number of detainees, as well as shelves and bedside tables for storage of personal items and foodstuffs. 35. The applicant could take a shower at least once a week. 36. He was given food three times a day on the basis of the established legal norms. The quality of the food was monitored on a regular basis by the medical staff of the detention facility. 37. The applicant was allowed a daily one-and-a-half hour outside walk. 38. The authorities ensured that regular disinfections and disinfestations were carried out in the detention facility. 39. In support of their observations the Government provided several certificates issued by the director of IZ-61/1 on 17 and 18 December 2007, statements by wardens (although not dated), a copy of the applicant’s prison card stating that he had been provided with bed sheets, cutlery and clothes, as well as a number of certificates concerning the food ration during the relevant period. 40. The applicant claimed that the number of detainees considerably exceeded the design capacity of the cells and that the detainees had to sleep in shifts. 41. The cells were dimly lit by two filament lamps. Access to daylight was restricted by metal screens and the arrangement of the bunks in two or three tiers. 42. The windows were not equipped with fresh-air shutters, and, therefore, the cells could not be aerated and the air was heavy with smoke. 43. The metal screens were not removed until April 2003, and the window panes started to be removed for better access to fresh air in summertime. 44. The lavatory in the corner of the cell was elevated above the floor and separated by a 1.1-metre partition from the wash basin, but not from the living area. There was no screen at the entrance to the toilet. The applicant thus had to use the toilet in the presence of other inmates and be present while the toilet was being used by his cellmates. 45. The applicant was never provided with any toiletries. 46. The cells swarmed with cockroaches, bedbugs and lice and were never treated by the administration. 47. In support of his statements the applicant produced written depositions by three former cellmates. They stated, in particular, that in 2002-2003 they had been detained together with the applicant in cell no. 48. The cell designed to accommodate ten persons housed up to fifty detainees at any one time. They also testified that they and the other detainees had slept in shifts. 48. On 23 April 2005 the applicant was transferred to correctional colony Uch-398/5 of Konstantinovsk, the Rostov Region (ФГУ Уч-398/5 ГУФСИН России), to serve his sentence. 49. Relying on the certificate issued by the director of Uch-398/5 on 25 December 2007 the Government submitted that the applicant is held in dormitory no. 5 measuring 334 square meters and equipped with 144 bunk beds. In 2005 the dormitory housed 135 convicts, in 2006, 132 convicts, and accommodates 144 convicts at the present time. 50. All convicts are provided with bedding and toiletries. 51. The premises of the dormitory have a sanitary unit separated from the main area and equipped with lavatory pans, cold and hot water taps and wash basins. 52. The dormitory is equipped with sealed–up window frames allowing to a sufficient extent access to natural light and fresh air when the frames are opened. The premises of the dormitory are ventilated on a regular basis. 53. In the daytime the dormitory is lit by thirty-seven 75 watt filament lamps and at night by four 60-75 watt security lights with tinted glass shades. 54. The applicant receives food three times a day on the basis of the established legal norms. The quality of the food is regularly monitored by the facility’s medical staff. 55. No persons infected with tuberculosis are kept in the correctional colony. 56. The applicant alleged that the living areas are overcrowded, and that the sanitary conditions, ventilation and lighting are inadequate. He further submitted that he has to share living space with detainees suffering from tuberculosis. 57. Until 1 July 2002 criminal-law matters were governed by the Code of Criminal Procedure of the RSFSR (Law of 27 October 1960, “the old CCrP”). From 1 July 2002 the old CCrP was replaced by the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation (Law no. 174-FZ of 18 December 2001, “the new CCrP”). 58. “Preventive measures” (меры пресечения) include an undertaking not to leave a town or region, personal security, bail and detention (Article 89 of the old CCrP, Article 98 of the new CCrP). 59. The Russian Constitution of 12 December 1993 establishes that a judicial decision is required before a defendant can be detained or his or her detention extended (Article 22). Under the old CCrP, a decision ordering detention could be taken by a prosecutor or a court (Articles 11, 89 and 96). The new CCrP requires a judicial decision by a district or town court on a reasoned request by a prosecutor supported by appropriate evidence (Article 108 §§ 1, 3-6). 60. When deciding whether to remand an accused in custody, the competent authority is required to consider whether there are “sufficient grounds to believe” that he or she would abscond during the investigation or trial or obstruct the establishment of the truth or reoffend (Article 89 of the old CCrP). It must also take into account the gravity of the charge, information on the accused’s character, his or her profession, age, state of health, family status and other circumstances (Article 91 of the old CCrP, Article 99 of the new CCrP). 61. Before 14 March 2001, detention was authorised if the accused was charged with a criminal offence carrying a sentence of at least one year’s imprisonment or if there were “exceptional circumstances” in the case (Article 96). On 14 March 2001 the old CCrP was amended to permit defendants to be remanded in custody if the charge carried a sentence of at least two years’ imprisonment or if they had previously defaulted or had no permanent residence in Russia or if their identity could not be ascertained. The amendments of 14 March 2001 also repealed the provision that permitted defendants to be remanded in custody on the sole ground of the dangerous nature of the criminal offence they had committed. The new CCrP reproduced the amended provisions (Articles 97 § 1 and 108 § 1) and added that a defendant should not be remanded in custody if a less severe preventive measure was available. 62. The Codes distinguished between two types of detention: the first being “pending the investigation”, that is, while a competent agency – the police or a prosecutor’s office – investigated the case, and the second “before the court” (or “during the trial”), that is, while the case was being tried in court. Although there was no difference in practice between them (the detainee was held in the same detention facility), the calculation of the time-limits was different. 63. After arrest the suspect is placed in custody “pending the investigation”. The maximum permitted period of detention “pending the investigation” is two months but can be extended for up to eighteen months in “exceptional circumstances”. Extensions were authorised by prosecutors of ascending hierarchical levels (under the old CCrP) but must now be authorised by judicial decisions taken by courts of ascending levels (under the new CCrP). No extension of detention “pending the investigation” beyond eighteen months is possible (Article 97 of the old CCrP, Article 109 § 4 of the new CCrP). 64. The period of detention “pending the investigation” is calculated to the day when the prosecutor sent the case to the trial court (Article 97 of the old CCrP, Article 109 § 9 of the new CCrP). 65. Access to the case file materials is to be granted no later than one month before the expiry of the authorised detention period (Article 97 of the old CCrP, Article 109 § 5 of the new CCrP). If the defendant needs more time to study the case file, a judge, on a request by a prosecutor, may grant an extension of detention until such time as the file has been read in full and the case sent for trial (Article 97 of the old CCrP, Article 109 § 8 (1) of the new CCrP). Under the old CCrP, such an extension could not be granted for longer than six months. 66. Under the old CCrP, the trial court had the right to remit the case for an “additional investigation” if it established that procedural defects existed that could not be remedied at the trial. In such cases the defendant’s detention was again classified as “pending the investigation” and the relevant time-limit continued to apply. If, however, the case was remitted for an additional investigation, but the investigators had already used up all the time authorised for detention “pending the investigation”, a supervising prosecutor could nevertheless extend the detention period for one additional month starting from the date he received the case. Subsequent extensions could only be granted if the detention “pending the investigation” had not exceeded eighteen months (Article 97). 67. From the date the prosecutor forwards the case to the trial court, the defendant’s detention is “before the court” (or “during the trial”). 68. Before 14 March 2001 the old CCrP set no time-limit for detention “during the trial”. On 14 March 2001 a new Article 239-1 was inserted which established that the period of detention “during the trial” could not generally exceed six months from the date the court received the file. However, if there was evidence to show that the defendant’s release might impede a thorough, complete and objective examination of the case, a court could – of its own motion or on a request by a prosecutor – extend the detention by no longer than three months. These provisions did not apply to defendants charged with a particularly serious criminal offence. 69. The new CCrP establishes that the term of detention “during the trial” is calculated from the date the court received the file to the date the judgment is given. The period of detention “during the trial” may not normally exceed six months, but if the case concerns serious or particularly serious criminal offences, the trial court may approve one or more extensions of no longer than three months each (Article 255 §§ 2 and 3). 70. Under the old CCrP, the detainee or his or her counsel or representative could challenge a detention order issued by a prosecutor, and any subsequent extension order, before a court. The judge was required to review the lawfulness of and justification for a detention or extension order no later than three days after receipt of the relevant papers. The review was to be conducted in camera in the presence of a prosecutor and the detainee’s counsel or representative. The detainee was to be summoned and a review in his absence was only permissible in exceptional circumstances if the detainee waived his right to be present of his own free will. The judge could either dismiss the challenge or revoke the pre-trial detention and order the detainee’s release (Article 220-1). An appeal to a higher court lay against the judge’s decision. It had to be examined within the same time-limit as appeals against a judgment on the merits (see paragraph 77 below) (Article 331 in fine). 71. Under the new CCrP, an appeal may be lodged with a higher court within three days against a judicial decision ordering or extending detention on remand. The appeal court must decide the appeal within three days of its receipt (Article 108 § 10). 72. Upon receipt of the case file, the judge must determine, in particular, whether the defendant should remain in custody or be released pending trial (Articles 222 § 5 and 230 of the old CCrP, Articles 228 (3) and 231 § 2 (6) of the new CCrP) and rule on any application by the defendant for release (Article 223 of the old CCrP). If the application was refused, a fresh application could be made once the trial had commenced (Article 223 of the old CCrP). 73. At any time during the trial the court may order, vary or revoke any preventive measure, including detention (Article 260 of the old CCrP, Article 255 § 1 of the new CCrP). Any such decision must be given in the deliberations room and signed by all the judges of the bench (Article 261 of the old CCrP, Article 256 of the new CCrP). 74. An appeal against such a decision lies to the higher court. It must be lodged within ten days and examined within the same time-limit as an appeal against the judgment on the merits (Article 331 of the old CCrP, Article 255 § 4 of the new CCrP – see paragraph 77 below). 75. Under the old CCrP, within fourteen days of receipt of the case file (if the defendant was in custody), the judge was required either: (1) to fix the trial date; (2) to return the case for an additional investigation; (3) to stay or discontinue the proceedings; or (4) to refer the case to a court with jurisdiction to hear it (Article 221). The new CCrP empowers the judge, within the same time-limit, (1) to refer the case to a competent court; (2) to fix a date for a preliminary hearing (предварительное слушание); or (3) to fix a date for trial (Article 227). The trial must begin no later than fourteen days after the judge has fixed the trial date (Article 239 of the old CCrP, Article 233 § 1 of the new CCrP). There are no restrictions on fixing the date of a preliminary hearing. 76. The duration of the trial is not limited. 77. Under the old CCrP, the appeal court was required to examine an appeal against the first-instance judgment within ten days of its receipt. In exceptional circumstances or in complex cases or in proceedings before the Supreme Court this time-limit could be extended by up to two months (Article 333). No further extensions were possible. The new CCrP establishes that the appeal court must start the examination of the appeal no later than one month after its receipt (Article 374). 78. The old CCrP provided that hearings in first-instance courts dealing with criminal cases were, subject to certain exceptions, to be conducted by a single professional judge or by one professional and two lay judges. In their judicial capacity, lay judges enjoyed the same rights as the professional judge (Article 15). 79. The new CCrP does not provide for participation of non-professional judges in administration of justice in criminal matters. It provides that serious crimes should be dealt with by a single professional judge or by three professional judges provided that the accused has submitted such a request prior to the scheduling of a trial hearing (Article 30 § 2 (3)). It further provides that the composition of the court examining the case should remain unchanged throughout the trial (Article 242 § 1). 80. The Federal Law enacting the new CCrP (Law no. 177-FZ of 18 December 2001) provides as follows: Section 2.1 provides that the Federal Law on the Lay Judges of the Federal Courts of General Jurisdiction is ineffective as of 1 January 2004. Section 7 provides that Article 30 § 2 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in so far as it concerns the examination of serious crimes by three professional judges, is effective as of 1 January 2004. Before that date serious crimes were to be dealt with by a single professional judge or by one professional and two lay judges if an accused filed such a request prior to the scheduling of a trial hearing. 81. Section 22 of the Detention of Suspects Act (Federal Law no. 103FZ of 15 July 1995) provides that detainees should be given free food sufficient to maintain them in good health according to the standards established by the Government of the Russian Federation. Section 23 provides that detainees should be kept in conditions which satisfy sanitary and hygienic requirements. They should be provided with an individual sleeping place and given bedding, tableware and toiletries. Each inmate should have no less than four square metres of personal space in his or her cell. 82. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) visited the Russian Federation from 2 to 17 December 2001. The section of its Report to the Russian Government (CPT/Inf (2003) 30) dealing with the conditions of detention in temporary holding facilities and remand establishments and the complaints procedure read as follows: “b. temporary holding facilities for criminal suspects (IVS) 26. According to the 1996 Regulations establishing the internal rules of Internal Affairs temporary holding facilities for suspects and accused persons, the living space per person should be 4 m². It is also provided in these regulations that detained persons should be supplied with mattresses and bedding, soap, toilet paper, newspapers, games, food, etc. Further, the regulations make provision for outdoor exercise of at least one hour per day. The actual conditions of detention in the IVS establishments visited in 2001 varied considerably. ... 45. It should be stressed at the outset that the CPT was pleased to note the progress being made on an issue of great concern for the Russian penitentiary system: overcrowding. When the CPT first visited the Russian Federation in November 1998, overcrowding was identified as the most important and urgent challenge facing the prison system. At the beginning of the 2001 visit, the delegation was informed that the remand prison population had decreased by 30,000 since 1 January 2000. An example of that trend was SIZO No 1 in Vladivostok, which had registered a 30% decrease in the remand prison population over a period of three years. ... The CPT welcomes the measures taken in recent years by the Russian authorities to address the problem of overcrowding, including instructions issued by the Prosecutor General’s Office, aimed at a more selective use of the preventive measure of remand in custody. Nevertheless, the information gathered by the Committee’s delegation shows that much remains to be done. In particular, overcrowding is still rampant and regime activities are underdeveloped. In this respect, the CPT reiterates the recommendations made in its previous reports (cf. paragraphs 25 and 30 of the report on the 1998 visit, CPT (99) 26; paragraphs 48 and 50 of the report on the 1999 visit, CPT (2000) 7; paragraph 52 of the report on the 2000 visit, CPT (2001) 2). ... 125. As during previous visits, many prisoners expressed scepticism about the operation of the complaints procedure. In particular, the view was expressed that it was not possible to complain in a confidential manner to an outside authority. In fact, all complaints, regardless of the addressee, were registered by staff in a special book which also contained references to the nature of the complaint. At Colony No 8, the supervising prosecutor indicated that, during his inspections, he was usually accompanied by senior staff members and prisoners would normally not request to meet him in private ‘because they know that all complaints usually pass through the colony’s administration’. In the light of the above, the CPT reiterates its recommendation that the Russian authorities review the application of complaints procedures, with a view to ensuring that they are operating effectively. If necessary, the existing arrangements should be modified in order to guarantee that prisoners can make complaints to outside bodies on a truly confidential basis.”","['13', '3', '5', '6']","['5-1', '5-3', '5-4', '6-1']",[],['5'],['5-1'],[],1

The applicant was born in 1946 and is currently residing in Campobasso. From 1974 to 1995 the applicant was employed as town clerk. 8. On 23 June 1983 the Campobasso Public Prosecutor’s Office informed the applicant that criminal proceedings had been instituted against him on charges of attempt to violate political rights of citizens and abuse of public authority. 9. On 25 June 1983 the applicant asked that a formal investigation be opened. On 28 June 1983 the Public Prosecutor rejected this claim. The applicant appealed against this decision. On 9 August 1983 the investigating judge decided that a formal investigation had to be opened. 10. No activity was registered until 14 June 1988, when the applicant appeared on his own initiative before the investigating judge. On 21 June 1988 a co-accused was examined and in March 1989 the investigating judge questioned ten witnesses during three hearings. 11. On 4 April 1989 the Public Prosecutor requested the investigating judge to charge the applicant with abuse of public authority. On 2 May 1989 the investigating judge questioned the applicant and his co-accused. On 18 May 1989 the Public Prosecutor requested the investigating judge to commit the applicant for trial. 12. In a decision of 16 June 1989, the investigating judge committed the applicant for trial before the Campobasso District Court. A hearing scheduled for 29 September 1992 did not take place and the case was adjourned until 15 December 1993. 13. On 13 January 1996 the President of the District Court summoned the applicant to appear on 27 March 1996. 14. In a judgment of the same day, filed with the registry on 9 April 1996, the District Court relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the Campobasso Assize Court. 15. On 28 March 1996 the applicant and his co-accused appealed on points of law against this judgment. By a decision of 9 October 1996, the Court of Cassation declared the applicant’s claim inadmissible. 16. On 8 January 1997 the president of the Assize Court scheduled the date of the hearing for 10 February 1997. 17. In a judgment of the same day, filed with the registry on 17 February 1997, the Assize Court acquitted the applicant. This decision became final on 23 July 1997.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

RUSSIA,4,Violation of Art. 3;Violation of Art. 5-1,Anatoly Kovler;Christos Rozakis;Elisabeth Steiner;George Nicolaou;Giorgio Malinverni;Khanlar Hajiyev,"5. The applicant was born in 1974 and is now serving his sentence in the Tula Region. 6. At about 11.30 a.m. on 10 April 2003 the cashier desk of the Petelino psychiatric hospital in the Tula Region was robbed by three men armed with a submachine gun and a sawn-off shotgun. Two police patrols arrived at the scene less than five minutes later. 7. The police officers who apprehended the applicant described the events in the following manner. Officer B. stated, in particular (his statement to the investigator is dated 17 June 2003): “I saw three men cross the motorway and disappear behind the forest shelter belt... I started running across the forest to intercept the criminals. At that moment I heard a burst of submachine gun fire. As I emerged out of the forest, I saw two men in front of me who later turned out to be K. and [the applicant]. K. wore light-blue jeans and a dark jacket, and [the applicant] wore dark tracksuit bottoms. K. carried a Kalashnikov submachine gun with no butt, and [the applicant] had a sawn-off rifle ... I told the criminals to freeze, drop the guns and offer no resistance. K. and [the applicant] ... crossed the motorway. Then I shot a few rounds in burst mode in the direction of the criminals but above their heads and told them again to freeze. [The applicant] fell on the roadside, and the rifle flew out of his hands ... K. turned around, saw the police car and fired several shots in its direction. Then he slipped and fell. I ran up to him, pointed my gun at him and told him to stop resistance and drop the weapon. The muzzle of his submachine gun was pointed at my face, so I kicked the gun out of his hand and used physical force on him in accordance with section 12 of the Police Act ... During that time, [Officer M.] was trying to tie up [the applicant] because he was trying to get up and run away ... During the arrest we had to use physical force on K., [the applicant], and Sh. because they actively resisted us. As a result, they sustained injuries but I cannot say what injuries and where because they were covered in mud.” 8. Officer M., in his statement to the investigator made on 11 April 2003, testified as follows: “Three men were running some seventy metres ahead of us... One of them – the one who was a bit taller, in light-blue jeans and black jacket – turned to us and fired a burst from his submachine gun in our direction ... [Officer B.] fired two shots at the running men ... The men had already crossed to the roadside in the direction of Novomoskovsk ... but the man in tracksuit bottoms fell on the roadside and covered his head with his hands. The man in blue jeans and black jacket fired a burst at the police car and started going down towards the forest but slipped and fell on his back ... He pointed his submachine gun at [Officer B.] who, in turned, pointed his gun at him and told him to drop the weapon. Meanwhile, I ran up to the second man who had fallen on the ground, covered his head with his hands and pushed away his sawn-off rifle ... and I told [Officer S.] to cuff his hands which he did. I ran up to [Officer B.] and told the man in blue jeans to throw the gun away. The man reclined on his back and put the gun aside. I kicked it away and, using martial arts, bent his arm behind his back, led him away and put him on the ground where handcuffs were applied to him ...” 9. On the same day Officer S. testified in the same vein: “... the man in tracksuit bottoms fell on the roadside and covered his head with his hands... [Officer M.] and I ran up to the second man who had fallen on the ground and covered his head; [Officer M.] kicked aside the sawn-off rifle and told me to use handcuffs on him which I did ...” 10. It appears from Officer Shch.'s statement of 15 July 2003 that he did not take part in the applicant's arrest: “... [Officers B., M., and S.] were running after them through the forest. [The applicant] fell on the roadside and [Officer S.] or someone else, I do not remember who, arrested him ...” 11. According to the applicant, he had fallen to the ground immediately after the police started firing, and covered his head with his arms. The applicant claimed that a police officer had approached him and kicked him in the head. His head had jerked and his face had hit gravel, chipping two teeth. 12. The applicant and two other men were brought to the Shatskoye police station in the Leninskiy district of the Tula Region. 13. The applicant submitted that he had been brought to an office on the second floor. Three riot-squad (“OMON”) and two operational officers had entered the room. They had worn camouflage fatigues and woven hats. The OMON officers had made him kneel down with his hands cuffed behind his back. The officers had kicked and punched him, dealing blows all over his body, including his face and lips. One officer had hit him several times with a chair leg, another officer had straightened his right leg out and dealt a strong blow on his knee. He had been told to strip down and an officer had pushed the chair leg into his rectum. 14. At 8 p.m. the investigator Mr Bu. carried out a visual examination of the applicant's person in the presence of two attesting witnesses and a chemistry specialist. He noted that the applicant's face was covered with a “grey substance” and also with a “blood-like brown substance”. One of his front teeth was chipped. There were no injuries on the anterior side of his body, but his other side was covered with bruises and haematomas. The applicant had a bruise on his right hip and abrasions on both knees. 15. On the following day, 11 April 2003, the applicant was placed in the temporary detention ward of the Leninskiy district police station. The applicant wrote a complaint to the prosecutor about the beatings. 16. On 13 April 2003 the investigator Mr Bu. refused to institute criminal proceedings into the applicant's allegations. Referring to the arresting officers Mr Shch. and Mr B. who claimed that the applicant had forcefully resisted the arrest, and to the statements by two operational officers who denied that the applicant had been beaten at the police station, the investigator adopted the view that the visible injuries had been caused during the arrest. 17. At 11.15 a.m. on 15 April 2003 a medical expert commissioned by the investigator of the Leninskiy district prosecutor's office Mr M. carried out a detailed examination of the applicant's injuries. The expert recorded multiple bruises and abrasions on the applicant's face, lips, left ear, right temple and cheek-bone, back, arms, wrists, right hip and shin, haemorrhage in the sclera of both eyes, and a broken tooth on the upper jaw. According to the expert, those injuries had been caused by no fewer than thirteen blows of a hard blunt object and no earlier than seven days before the examination. 18. On 18 April 2003 the applicant was transferred from the Leninskiy district police station to remand centre no. IZ-71/1 in Tula. On arrival at the remand centre he was examined by a doctor. According to the medical certificate of the same date, the applicant had a bruise around his right eye, as well as an abrasion and an injury on his right hip. He told the doctor that he had been beaten at the police station. 19. On 19 June 2003 a deputy Leninskiy district prosecutor issued a new decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings into the applicant's allegations of ill-treatment. The text of the decision was identical, word by word, to that of the decision of 13 April 2003. 20. The applicant complained to a higher prosecutor. On 19 February 2004 the acting Leninskiy district prosecutor upheld the decisions of 13 April and 19 June 2003 as lawful and justified. 21. In November 2003, counsel for the applicant complained about the ill-treatment to the Uzlovaya town prosecutor, the Tula regional prosecutor, the Prosecutor General's Office, the Internal Security Department of the Tula Regional Police, the Federal Security Service, and other authorities. On 11 August and 22 December 2003 and 27 January 2004 the applicant also sent complaints about ill-treatment to the Tula regional prosecutor. 22. On 25 December 2003 a deputy Tula regional prosecutor replied to the applicant's lawyer that his complaints about ill-treatment had already been examined and that a decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings had been made. 23. On 18 June 2004 the applicant complained to the trial court about illtreatment and the authorities' failure to investigate his allegations. It is unclear whether any formal response was received. 24. On 2 September 2004 Officers B., M., S., and Shch. and the investigator Mr Bu. were heard in the witness stand by the trial court. Officer Shch. stated that the defendants had not offered any resistance during the arrest and that they had been immediately handcuffed. He denied using any physical force during the arrest and pointed out that K. had been dirty but had had no visible injuries. Officer B. submitted that no force had been employed but he had bent K.'s arms and handcuffed him. Officer S. confirmed that, once on the ground, the defendants had no longer resisted the arrest and that there was no attempt to punish them after the arrest. Officer M. testified that one of the defendants had been handcuffed, and the other's hands had been tied with a belt. The investigator Mr Bu. said that he was unable to remember any injuries on the defendants. 25. On 10 January 2005 the applicant challenged the investigator's decision of 13 April 2003 before a court of general jurisdiction. He submitted that the inquiry had been incomplete because the investigator had never interviewed him about the alleged ill-treatment. The statements by the arresting officers had been contradictory: in the criminal proceedings they had denied that he had offered any resistance, whereas the investigator had found that the injuries had been caused during the arrest. The applicant enclosed the medical certificates dated 10 April and 15 April 2003. 26. On 25 February 2005 the Leninskiy District Court of the Tula Region dismissed the applicant's complaint without taking cognisance of the merits. It held, firstly, that the contested decision did not restrict the applicant's constitutional rights or impede his access to justice and therefore was not amenable to review under Article 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Secondly, it stated that an inquiry into the applicant's allegations of ill-treatment had been carried out in the framework of criminal proceedings against him and therefore concerned the evidence in the criminal case which was pending before the trial court. The District Court declared itself incompetent to examine the matters which were being examined by the trial court. 27. The applicant was not present or represented at the hearing before the Leninskiy District Court. He filed an appeal, in which he complained that the District Court had not ensured his representation at the hearing and failed to examine the evidence of ill-treatment he had submitted. 28. On 13 April 2005 the Tula Regional Court upheld, in summary fashion, the District Court's judgment. It noted that there had been no violation of the applicant's right to defence because both he and counsel for him had been informed of the hearing date but had not sought leave to appear. 29. On 12 April 2003 the Leninskiy District Court of the Tula Region remanded the applicant in custody for an initial two-month period. 30. On 16 April 2003 the applicant was charged with an armed robbery of the hospital. 31. On 9 June, 6 August, 14 October, and 29 December 2003 the Uzlovaya Town Court extended the applicant's detention until 15 February 2004. On 13 February 2004 it granted a further extension until 10 April 2004. 32. On 9 April 2004 the case against the applicant and his co-defendants was submitted to the Uzlovaya Town Court for trial. 33. On 16 April 2004 the applicant complained to the Tula regional prosecutor that, following the expiry of the last detention order on 10 April 2004, there was no legal basis for his continued detention. He did not receive a reply. 34. On 23 April 2004 the Uzlovaya Town Court gave a decision fixing the date of the preliminary hearing. The decision did not mention the question of the applicant's detention. 35. At the preliminary hearing on 13 May 2004 the Town Court ruled that the bill of indictment was procedurally defective in that it contained incorrect information about the applicant's personal details. The court decided to return the case to the prosecutor for five days so that he could remedy these defects. It also rejected applications for release by the applicant and his co-defendants, noting that the preventive measure had been imposed lawfully and that there were no grounds for varying it. 36. On 17 May 2004 the prosecutor again sent the case for trial. On 31 May 2004 the Uzlovaya Town Court set the opening date for the trial and held that all the defendants should remain in custody, without citing any grounds for the continuation of their detention on remand or setting a time-limit for it. 37. On 4 November 2004 the Uzlovaya Town Court heard the prosecutor's application for a further extension of the applicant's detention. The applicant and his co-defendants applied for release, maintaining that the initial six-month period of their detention pending trial had expired on 9 October 2004. 38. The Town Court held that the six-month period of detention should be calculated from the date when the case had been sent for trial again, that is, from 17 May 2004. It extended all the co-defendants' detention by three months, citing as the ground the complexity of the case and the large number of victims and witnesses who had not yet been examined. The applicant filed an appeal. He submitted that, if the six-month period were to be calculated from 17 May 2004, his detention from 9 April to 17 May 2004 must have been unlawful. On 17 December 2004 the Tula Regional Court rejected his appeal in summary fashion, endorsing the reasoning of the Town Court. 39. On 10 February 2005 the Uzlovaya Town Court granted a further extension of the defendants' detention until 17 May 2005. On 15 April 2005 the Tula Regional Court upheld that decision on an appeal by the applicant. 40. On 19 July 2005 the Uzlovaya Town Court convicted the defendants of four robberies and sentenced the applicant to ten years' imprisonment in a high-security institution. On 25 January 2006 the Tula Regional Court upheld the conviction on appeal. 41. The applicant submitted copies of three articles published in the regional press in 2004. The articles described the robbery of the hospital and two other robberies imputed to the applicant and his co-defendants. The perpetrators were described as “jackals from Petelino”, “robbers” or a “gang”. The same photograph accompanied all three articles; the face and upper body of the person on the photograph were covered with a jacket. 42. The investigator's or prosecutor's decision refusing institution of criminal proceedings or discontinuing criminal proceedings, as well as any other acts capable of impairing the constitutional rights or freedoms of parties to criminal proceedings or impeding citizens' access to justice, are amenable to judicial review by the court located at the place where the pre-trial investigation is being carried out (Article 125 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).","['3', '5']",['5-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Jadranska Lešnica. 6. The applicant lived with her partner, P.J., in Belgrade from May 2001 until January 2006, when she moved to her parents’ house, as a result of alleged “psychological abuse” by her partner. Their daughter M.J., who was born in 2002, continued to live with her father. 7. On 20 February 2006 the applicant lodged a civil claim against P.J. (“the respondent”) with the First Municipal Court (Prvi opštinski sud) in Belgrade (“the Municipal Court”), seeking sole custody of M.J. and child maintenance (vršenje roditeljskog prava i izdržavanje). 8. On 1 March 2006 the respondent lodged a separate claim against the applicant, with the Municipal Court, also seeking sole custody of M.J. and child maintenance. 9. On 16 May 2006 the Municipal Court obtained an opinion from the Palilula Social Care Centre (Gradski centar za socijalni rad, Odeljenje Palilula), which stated that the custody should be given to the mother. 10. On 17 May 2006 the applicant requested the court to issue an interim measure regulating her right of access to M.J. 11. At the hearing held on 8 June 2006, the respondent also requested an interim measure awarding him temporary custody of M.J. 12. On 15 June 2006 the Municipal Court ordered the respondent to allow the applicant access to M.J. by bringing their daughter at 2 p.m. every last Friday of the month to the Loznica Social Care Centre and collecting her from the applicant in Belgrade at the same time the following Friday. 13. On 20 June 2006 the respondent objected to the Social Care Centre’s opinion of May 2006 and subsequently, on 10 July 2006, appealed against the interim access order. It would appear that the latter appeal was forwarded to the District Court (Okružni sud) in Belgrade on 27 August 2006. 14. The next hearing, scheduled for 3 July 2006, was adjourned because the Municipal Court had failed to secure the presence of lay judges (sudija porotnika) for family matters as required under the relevant provisions of the domestic law. 15. The hearing scheduled for 5 September 2006 was also adjourned, because at that time the case file was physically in the possession of the District Court, which was about to rule in respect of the adopted interim access order. 16. On 14 September 2006 the District Court in Belgrade rejected the respondent’s appeal and upheld the interim access order of 15 June 2006. 17. On 30 November 2006 the Municipal Court considered whether to join the two sets of civil proceedings into a single case file, and adjourned the case until 30 January 2007. 18. Meanwhile, on 6 November 2006 the Palilula Social Care Centre informed the Municipal Court that the respondent’s objection to their first opinion of 16 May 2006 had been accepted, because the competent Ministry had found irregularities in its work. The Centre also warned the court that it could not have reliably assessed whether the conclusion of this opinion had been in the best interest of the child, in particular due to the need to ascertain the applicant’s state of mental health. 19. Following the Centre’s additional updated opinion of 4 December 2006 (see paragraph 52 below), on 11 December 2006 the Municipal Court issued a new interim access order, restricting the applicant’s access to M.J. to two hours on Fridays at the premises of the Palilula Social Care Centre in Belgrade, thereby rendering the interim access order of 15 June 2006 obsolete. 20. On 22 December 2006 the applicant appealed against the new interim access order, while on 9 January 2007 she informed the court that she had not been and would not be going to Belgrade to see her daughter, because she was afraid of the respondent’s abusive behaviour and intimidation. 21. On 30 January 2007 the Municipal Court noted that the applicant had appeared in person but that the hearing had been scheduled for the following day and that she would not be able to attend it."" (see paragraph 17 above). 22. The interim access order was confirmed by the District Court in Belgrade on 14 February 2007. 23. On 27 April 2007 the Municipal Court formally joined the two sets of proceedings, while the applicant submitted that an opinion of the Loznica Social Care Centre could also be obtained and interim custody be granted to her. 24. On 7 May 2007 the Municipal Court granted interim custody in respect of M.J. to the respondent, pending the final outcome of the ongoing civil suit. It also requested the Palilula Social Care Centre to produce an expert opinion as to how custody should be determined in the best interests of the child, as well as on the access rights of the non-custodial parent. The interim access order of 11 December 2006 remained in force as regards the applicant’s contact with her daughter. 25. On 6 June 2007 the District Court upheld this decision on appeal. On 13 July that court forwarded the case file to the Municipal Court. 26. On 18 June 2007 the Palilula Social Care Centre produced a report, giving its recommendation on how the custody and access rights should be determined (see paragraph 58 below). 27. On 27 September 2007 the Loznica Social Care Centre issued a report on the applicant’s visits to that centre. 28. The hearing scheduled for 22 November 2007 was adjourned because of a strike by the judicial authorities. 29. On 12 December 2007 the applicant requested withdrawal of the Municipal Court judge, but on 19 December 2007 the President of the court dismissed her request. 30. At the next hearing, held on 20 December 2007, the Municipal Court decided to hear both parties in person on 28 January 2008. 31. Further hearings were held on 28 January and 4 March 2008. On the latter date the applicant requested the Municipal Court to obtain an expert opinion on the psychological and physical ability of both her and the respondent to take care of the child. 32. After both parties had made an advance payment of the costs of the expert opinion, on 3 April 2008 the Municipal Court ordered the Committee of the Belgrade Medical Faculty to prepare the expert report. 33. However, at a hearing held on 1 October 2008, the court reversed its decision and ordered that the expert report be prepared by the Dr Laza Lazarevic Institute of Neuropsychiatry. 34. On 19 March 2009 the Board of Experts of the Institute of Neuropsychiatry informed the Municipal Court that due to the negative attitude of the applicant towards this institution and the allegation of previous forgery of her health certificates by the Institute’s doctors, it would not be able to obtain expert testimony at the hospital. On the same date the Municipal Court requested the Social Care Centre to enable the Board of Experts to have the applicant and the child observed at the Centre. 35. Following the examinations of the parties and M.J. on 19 and 24 March 2009, on 27 April 2009 the Board of Experts submitted its report on the parties’ ability to exercise parental rights and responsibilities. It also submitted an additional report on 15 May 2009 in which it recommended that custody be granted to the respondent. 36. The hearing scheduled for 8 July 2009 was adjourned, because the applicant had appointed a lawyer, who needed some time to study the case file. 37. The next hearing, scheduled for 30 September 2009, was adjourned at the request of the applicant’s lawyer. He was ordered by the court to respond to the expert report within fifteen days. 38. The hearing scheduled for 11 November 2009 was not held, because of a strike by the Bar Association. 39. The hearing scheduled for 9 December 2009 was adjourned indefinitely, due to an ongoing reform of the judiciary. 40. The applicant submitted objections to the expert report on 11 November and 9 December 2009. The respondent replied to the applicant’s objections on 31 December 2009. On 3 March 2010, the applicant commented on the respondent’s observations. 41. The Board of Experts replied on 30 March 2010 to the applicant’s comments on its report. On 9 June 2010 the respondent commented on both the experts’ and the applicant’s observations. 42. On 17 June 2010 the Court of First Instance held its first hearing after the reform of the judiciary had been concluded. 43. On the 18 June 2010 the Court of First Instance ordered M.J.’s school psychologist to provide an assessment of the psycho-physical state of the child. It also ordered the Palilula Social Care Centre to provide an updated opinion on the determination of custody and to inform it about the results of the pending corrective monitoring of the parties’ exercise of parental rights by the Marriage and Family Counselling Office (see paragraph 65 below). 44. On 19 July 2010 the court received the assessment from the school psychologist. 45. The Court of First Instance scheduled the next hearing for 15 September 2010 in order to hear both parties. 46. It would appear that the proceedings are still pending before the first-instance court. 47. Following the adoption of the interim access order on 15 June 2006, the first attempt to reunite the applicant with M.J. took place on 7 July 2006, at the Loznica Social Care Centre. According to the Centre’s report, the respondent had not prepared M.J. for the reunion and was verbally aggressive throughout the meeting. M.J. was initially reluctant to approach the applicant, but she ultimately “came closer” and accepted gifts from her mother. The Centre proposed that future meetings be scheduled on Fridays, in a park not far from the respondent’s flat in Belgrade, before the applicant and M.J. started spending an entire week together. The applicant stated that she feared being left alone with the respondent. It was the first and last time that the respondent brought M.J. to Loznica, refusing to do so afterwards. 48. On 14 August 2006 the applicant formally requested enforcement of the interim access order of 15 June 2006. On 17 August 2006 the Municipal Court dismissed the applicant’s request as incomplete, since the interim access order bore no stamp certifying that it had become final. 49. On appeal, on 13 November 2006 the District Court quashed this decision and remitted the case. It would appear that this decision was served on the applicant on 11 May 2007. 50. The applicant continued going to the premises of the Loznica Social Care Centre on Fridays, stating that she was afraid to meet her daughter in the presence of the respondent in Belgrade and insisting on meeting her in Loznica. Following her query about the possible presence of social workers during those meetings, she was informed that this was not the usual practice. 51. On 24 November 2006 the applicant called on the Loznica Social Care Centre to request the enforcement of the interim access order as rendered by the Municipal Court. She was informed that the Centre was not in charge of the case, as M.J. lived in Belgrade. 52. On 4 December 2006 the Centre submitted an additional updated opinion to the Municipal Court, stating that, taking into account that there had been no regular or substantial contact between the applicant and M.J. in recent months, it was in the child’s best interests to remain temporarily living with the father. The Centre suggested providing a new final report upon putting more efforts into restoring the bond between the mother and daughter. 53. On 11 December 2006 the Municipal Court issued a new interim access order, restricting the applicant’s contact with M.J. to two hours each Friday at the Palilula Social Care Centre in Belgrade. 54. On 18 December 2006 the Loznica Social Care Centre sent its opinion to the Palilula Social Care Centre, indicating that the respondent might be being manipulative about the alleged problematic mental health of the applicant. It proposed that a medical institution examine the applicant and give an opinion on both parties’ capacity to exercise parental rights and responsibilities. 55. On 9 January 2007 the applicant informed the court that she had not been and would not be going to Belgrade to see her daughter as she was afraid of the respondent’s alleged threats and promises to “send her to bedlam”. 56. It appears from a letter from the Palilula Social Care Centre dated 9 April 2008 that the applicant had not up to that point attended any of the scheduled meetings with her daughter in Belgrade. 57. On 7 May 2007 the Municipal Court granted interim custody in respect of M.J. to the respondent, while the interim access order of 11 December 2006 remained in force as regards the applicant’s contact with her daughter. 58. On 18 June 2007 the Palilula Social Care Centre recommended that custody be granted to the respondent, while the applicant’s access rights were to be limited to one hour every Friday, at the Palilula Social Care Centre. The access ruling was subject to change and extension once the emotional and caring links between the applicant and her daughter had been restored. The Centre’s experts pointed out that the applicant had not contacted them in order to be able to see M.J., and offered professional assistance to facilitate contact between the mother and child, as well as with the respondent in order to motivate M.J. to maintain contact with the applicant. They noted that the respondent had inquired about the applicant’s interest in seeing M.J and had been allowing regular visits to M.J. by her older stepbrother (the applicant’s son). 59. On 18 and 19 September 2007 the applicant contacted both social care centres, stating that the respondent had not been allowing her any contact with M.J., even indirectly by phone. She requested both centres to initiate proceedings for deprivation of the respondent’s parental rights. 60. On 31 December 2007 the applicant informed the Palilula Social Care Centre that she had remarried and changed her surname. When the Centre asked her to attend the scheduled meetings with M.J., she said she did not have enough money to travel to Belgrade and was afraid of the respondent. 61. Despite the fact that the interim access order of 15 June 2006 was no longer valid, the applicant requested its enforcement in six written pleadings to the Fourth Municipal Court in Belgrade between September 2007 and January 2008. On 18 January 2008 this court issued an enforcement order in this respect. However, that court subsequently, following the respondent’s objection, suspended the enforcement proceedings. 62. At the hearing on 1 October 2008, the applicant stressed that she had not seen her daughter since 7 July 2006 and urged the Municipal Court to change the location of their scheduled meetings to the applicant’s place of residence. She repeated that she did not have enough money to travel to Belgrade each week to see her daughter. When asked by the court whether she wished to have a meeting with her daughter that same day, the applicant stated that she was afraid of the respondent, as well as of her daughter’s reaction on seeing her. 63. According to the report of the Palilula Social Care Centre dated 16 August 2010, on 6 May 2009 the applicant had requested the Palilula Social Care Centre to organise a meeting with M.J. for the first time in accordance with the second interim access order of 11 December 2006. Despite the Centre’s warning about the need to take appropriate steps to prepare M.J. for the forthcoming visits after a lengthy absence of care and contact between them, the applicant allegedly insisted on having contact with M.J. starting from 8 May. 64. It would appear that since 8 May 2009 the applicant has been meeting with M.J. regularly. However, the Social Care Centre experts reported that the applicant was not really aware that a mother’s absence could have a profound impact on her daughter and could alienate her daughter’s affection towards her. While she insisted on emotional reciprocation from her daughter, the contact was a significant source of stress for the child, who cried, hid behind her father, persistently avoided to look at her mother, refused the applicant’s gifts and asserted that she had been beaten by her. Nevertheless, the applicant systematically accused the respondent of abusing his position as the parent with interim custody and of inculcating M.J.’s attitude towards her. 65. The Centre also reported a severely dysfunctional parental relationship and an ambivalent approach on the part of the respondent to the importance of M.J.’s contact with her mother. In order to improve the parental and parent-child relationships, on 10 May 2010 the Centre adopted of its own motion a decision on corrective monitoring of the parties’ exercise of parental rights by the Marriage and Family Counselling Office, for a minimum of six months. The Office was supposed to work with the parents to help them acquire a better understanding of their parental rights and responsibilities, as well as of the needs of their daughter. After they had undergone this therapy, the Centre was to evaluate changes in their attitudes and approaches in exercising parental roles, as well as to assess the need for further measures for the protection of M.J.’s rights. The respondent was also supposed to bring M.J. regularly to the Counselling Office, which would work on improving her motivation in order to try to salvage her contact with the applicant. 66. On 4 December 2006 the applicant instituted proceedings against P.J., requesting that he be deprived of his parental rights (“roditeljsko pravo”) because of his behaviour in respect of their daughter. It would appear that P.J. lodged the same claim against the applicant and that the competent court eventually joined the two proceedings. 67. In the course of those proceedings, on 11 September 2007 the applicant sought an interim injunction against domestic violence. She claimed that P.J. had threatened her, which is why she was afraid to attend the scheduled meetings with her daughter. 68. On 3 December 2007 the court granted her request and issued an interim measure prohibiting P.J. from approaching or further disturbing the applicant. 69. However, on 6 November 2008 the District Court quashed this interim measure on appeal and returned the case for reconsideration. 70. On 2 February 2009 the court decided to separate the proceedings for protection against domestic violence from those for deprivation of parental rights. 71. As regards the proceedings for protection against domestic violence, on 21 October 2009 the First Municipal Court in Belgrade granted an injunction against domestic violence, i. e. “insulting or any other insolent, unscrupulous or malevolent behaviour” as defined in the Article 197 § 6 of the Family Law. In particular, it banned the respondent from disturbing the applicant for one year, as well as from coming within 500 metres of her and her place of residence, other than when necessary to allow contact between the applicant and the child. 72. On 13 May 2010 the Court of Appeal upheld the former part of this decision, quashed the latter due to the lack of valid and convincing reasons and remitted it for re-examination. 73. It would appear that these proceedings are still pending. 74. In 1993 the applicant had been diagnosed with interstitial lung disease, having subsequently become depressive and occasionally in need of psychiatric treatment. 75. Article 110 states that a competent authority may exempt a party to administrative proceedings from paying the costs of the proceedings, including witnesses’ and experts’ costs and expenses, if it finds that paying those expenses would affect the individual and his/her family’s well-being and ability to maintain themselves. 76. Other relevant provisions are set out in the cases of V.A.M. v. Serbia (no. 39177/05, §§ 56-59 and 65-75, 13 March 2007), and Tomić v. Serbia (no. 25959/06, §§ 55-62 and 68-71, 26 June 2007).",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicants were born in 1922, 1920, 1962, 1958, 1955, 1953, 1935, 1933, 1958, 1959, 1968, 1964, 1961, 1962, 1966, 1957, 1962 and 1959 respectively. The ninth, tenth, twelfth and thirteenth applicants live in the United Kingdom, the eleventh applicant lives in the United States and all the other applicants live in Malta. 7. The applicants or their ancestors (hereinafter “the applicants”) were owners of half an undivided share of several properties in Senglea, namely, five apartments on the ground floor and an adjacent entrance giving access to another twenty apartments above. At the time when the property was acquired, for the price of 345 pounds sterling (approximately 400 euros (“EUR”)), it was leased and occupied by various third parties. 8. This property was damaged during the Second World War and war-damage compensation was due to the owners under the War Damage Ordinance. 9. By a declaration of 27 February 1951 the Government took possession of this property under title of “possession and use” in accordance with the Land Acquisition (Public Purposes) Ordinance (see relevant domestic law). Under this title the owners were paid a yearly acquisition rent of 88 Maltese liras (“MTL”) − approximately EUR 205 for the entire property. This rent was calculated on the rental value declared by the owners to the Land Valuation Office. 10. Subsequently, without requesting prior consent from the owners and without having the plans of the property as it stood, the Government demolished the property and built a new set of apartments on wholly different plans, using part of the property to widen a road. The Government noted that permission for demolition was not necessary since they had legal possession of the property. At the time since the city of Senglea had been totally bombarded and consisted of a pile of rubble, the Government were engaged in an intensive restructuring and construction exercise, taking possession of properties and rebuilding the area with residences for social accommodation. In doing this the applicants alleged that the Government had also appropriated to themselves the war-damage compensation due to them. The Government considered this allegation to be unsubstantiated. 11. On 24 September 1991 the owners wrote to the Commissioner of Lands (“COL”) requesting compensation for their property. They suggested the sum of MTL 105,000 – approximately EUR 244,584. Receipt of their request was acknowledged but the claim remained unanswered. 12. By a declaration of 22 June 1993 the Government acquired the said property under the title of “public tenure” according to the Land Acquisition (Public Purposes) Ordinance (see relevant domestic law). Under this title the owners continued to be paid EUR 205 per year for the entire property. 13. In the meantime, this property was allocated as housing to third parties and included a shop. 14. The applicants pointed out that in 1988 the Government had declared that it would no longer be resorting to takings under titles of “possession and use” or “public tenure”. During political debate, the Deputy Prime Minister had in fact referred to such takings as a nefarious method of acquisition. Indeed, in the past twenty years the Government had converted takings under title of “possession and use” or “public tenure” to takings under “outright purchase”. The latter provided for a more favourable form of compensation, namely the market value of the property at the time of taking. The applicants submitted a number of examples reflecting this allegation (for example, Legal Notice nos. 271 and 272 of 2010 converting previous takings to outright purchases, and declaration no. 578 of 31 August 1990 substituting a declaration of taking under possession and use of a few months earlier with an outright purchase, following complaints by the owners. In the latter case the property had also been demolished and rebuilt and was being used for social housing). 15. The applicants also submitted an expert report valuing the entire property in Senglea at EUR 950,000. Thus, their share as owners of half an undivided share was worth EUR 475,000. 16. On 13 March 1998 the applicants brought constitutional redress proceedings. Invoking Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention and Article 14 they requested that the court find a violation of their rights as a consequence of the actions taken by the COL and to grant adequate compensation. Given the way the application was presented the Government did not plead non-exhaustion in respect of the failure of the applicants to institute proceedings before the LAB. 17. The case was set down for hearing on 25 March 1998. On 25 September 1998 the court-appointed architect was requested to conduct an on-site inspection to determine whether the property built by the Government was indeed built on the applicants’ property and what use was being made of the ground floor. The report was submitted on 5 January 1999; however, the court-appointed expert failed to draw up an estimate of the value of the property in issue and the applicants’ request for additional terms of reference to be given to the expert was rejected on 16 December 1999 on the basis that the value of the property was irrelevant to the merits of the claim. Subsequently, on 7 September 2001 the case was adjourned pending negotiations regarding the possibility of reaching an amicable solution to the case. This having failed, the proceedings continued on 20 February 2002 at the applicants’ request. On 14 November 2002 the applicants requested the court to make written submissions. On 1 March 2005 the applicants requested that the case be suspended pending the determination of another constitutional case that could have affected the merits of their case. The hearing of submissions recommenced on 22 May 2007. The Government filed their written submissions on 12 September 2007 and the case was scheduled for judgment on 9 October 2007. 18. By a judgment of 16 October 2008 the Civil Court (First Hall), acting in its constitutional jurisdiction, rejected their claims. It held that, since the applicants were still owners of the said property, the taking under both titles could not be considered a deprivation of property but a control of the use of such property. This control had been necessary in view of the fact that the property had been ruined in the war and that there had been a need to provide social housing in the post-war years. For the same reasons, even assuming that the taking under title of public tenure had been a deprivation of possessions, it would have been in the public interest. In respect of the fair balance required, the court observed that, when the State was pursuing economic reform or social justice, less reimbursement was due than the full market value. While it was true that the recognition rent payable to the applicants was not high and there were no prospects for it to be increased in future years, it was comparable to the rents applicable under the controlled rents regime in force in respect of other old properties. Moreover, in the present case the owners had not been required to incur expenses for the building of the new apartments or for their maintenance and when the property had been originally purchased by the owners’ ancestors it was already rented to third parties to which such regulated rents applied. In consequence, it could not be said that the applicants had borne an excessive burden. The court found that their related complaint under the same provision in respect of the unauthorised demolition could not be examined ratione temporis. 19. Lastly, as to the complaint regarding the difference in treatment as a result of the taking under title of public tenure as opposed to an outright purchase, the court held that the choice was specifically available to the Government. However, according to the policy in force, takings under titles of possession and use were converted to outright purchases in cases where the properties were used for commercial purposes. Other properties, where the Government wished to keep control of the expropriated property, were taken under title of public tenure. While this choice allowed for a large margin of appreciation, the applicants had not proved that other people in an analogous position had been treated more favourably and it did not appear that the policy had been applied arbitrarily or in a discriminatory fashion in the applicants’ case. 20. On appeal, by a judgment of 6 October 2009 the Constitutional Court upheld the first-instance judgment. 21. Primarily, it noted that the applicants had been acquiescent for a period of forty years before they ever solicited any action from the authorities or the relevant courts. On the merits, it confirmed that the interference did not amount to a deprivation since quite apart from retaining the title of ownership, the applicants had continued to receive rent in respect of the said property and to have standing to institute proceedings in respect of complaints relating to the property. Thus, not all the legal rights of the owners had been extinguished. 22. It further noted that the legality of the interference and the public interest involved were not disputed. Indeed, the law (section 12(3) of the Land Acquisition (Public Purposes) Ordinance, prior to its amendment) allowed the State to carry out works on property taken under possession and use, without any specific limitation. Moreover, the property which had been demolished and rebuilt had been taken in a damaged state, and any complaints about the entitlement to war-damage compensation remained unsubstantiated and were irrelevant to the main complaint in issue. 23. The decision as to under which title the property could be taken fell within the margin of appreciation of the State. As to the fair balance and the relevant amount of compensation, while it was true that a rent of EUR 205 was by today’s standards low for the property in issue, the value of the property had to reflect the values applicable in 1951 and not 2009. It noted that the applicants had not even contested the amount of rent due before the Land Arbitration Board (“LAB”) and that their acquiescence had led to a situation where even if they had wanted to do so, they could not prove the boundaries of the property. However, it was also true that the authorities had failed in their duty to draft a report as to the state and the boundaries of the property before they demolished it and created new plans for it. Thus, at this stage it was impossible to determine the actual boundaries of the property and in this state of uncertainty it was not surprising that the applicants had not taken up the procedure before the LAB. In any event, the court was of the view that the complaint was manifestly ill-founded. 24. As to the complaint under Article 14, it noted the witness testimony from the Department of Lands to the effect that takings under absolute purchase had occurred, although they generally related to commercial properties; that there had been cases were the Government had acted differently and acquired property by outright purchase following a taking by title of possession and use; that there was no hard policy regulating what type of taking was required in each case; and that to the witness’s knowledge there had been no political or other specific reasons motivating such an action. The court concluded that the fact that it had been established that other property had been taken by absolute purchase was not enough to prove discriminatory treatment and therefore there could not be a violation of the said provision. 25. The Constitutional Court further criticised the delay of ten and a half years which the first-instance court had taken to decide on the case even though a good part of the delay had been attributable to the applicants who, inter alia, had taken four and a half years to make submissions. 26. Following the introduction of the application with the Court (April 2010), on 3 June 2010 the Government issued a declaration that the property was being taken under title of absolute purchase. The property was valued in terms of section 22 of the Ordinance and the compensation offered was that of EUR 168,417.43. 27. Section 5 of the Land Acquisition (Public Purposes) Ordinance (“the Ordinance”), Chapter 88 of the Laws of Malta provides for three methods of acquisition by the Government of private property. It reads as follows: “The competent authority may acquire any land required for any public purpose, either - (a) by the absolute purchase thereof; or (b) for the possession and use thereof for a stated time, or during such time as the exigencies of the public purpose shall require; or (c) on public tenure: Provided that after a competent authority has acquired any land for possession and use or on public tenure the conversion into public tenure or into absolute ownership of the terms upon which such land is held shall always be deemed to be an acquisition of land required for a public purpose and to be in the public interest: Provided also that, subject to the provisions of articles 14, 15 and 16, a competent authority may acquire land partly by one and partly by another or others of the methods in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c): Provided further that where the land is to be acquired on behalf and for the use of a third party for a purpose connected with or ancillary to the public interest or utility, the acquisition shall, in every case, be by the absolute purchase of the land.” 28. Section 13 regarding compensation reads, in so far as relevant, as follows: “ (1) The amount of compensation to be paid for any land required by a competent authority may be determined at any time by agreement between the competent authority and the owner, saving the provisions contained in subarticle (2). (2) The compensation shall in the case of acquisition of land for temporary possession and use be an acquisition rent and in the case of acquisition of land on public tenure be a recognition rent determined in either case in accordance with the relevant provisions contained in article 27.” 29. The Ordinance provides that compensation in respect of absolute purchase is calculated in accordance with the applicable “fair rent”, as agreed by the parties following the Government’s offer or as established by the LAB. In respect of public tenure, section 27(13) of the Ordinance provides as follows: “The compensation in respect of the acquisition of any land on public tenure shall be equal to the acquisition rent assessable in respect thereof in accordance with the provisions contained in subarticles (2) to (12), inclusive, of this article, increased (a) by forty per centum (40%) in the case of an old urban tenement and (b) by twenty per centum (20%) in the case of agricultural land. 30. In so far as relevant, section 19(1) and (5) reads as follows: (1) When land has been acquired by a competent authority for use and possession during such time as the exigencies of the public purpose shall require, the owner may, after the lapse of ten years from the date when possession was taken by the competent authority, apply to the Board for an order that the land be purchased or acquired on public tenure or vacated within a period of one year from the date of the order, and the land shall either be vacated or acquired on public tenure or purchased upon compensation to be determined in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance or of any Ordinance amending or substituted for this Ordinance. (5) Public tenure shall of its nature endure in perpetuity, without prejudice to any consolidation by mutual consent or otherwise according to law of that tenure with the residual ownership of the land; and the recognition rent payable in respect thereof shall in every case be unalterable, without prejudice to the effects of any consolidation, total or partial. The residual ownership of land held on public tenure with the inherent right to receive recognition rent, shall, for all purposes of law, be deemed to be an immovable right by reason of the object to which it refers and shall be transferable according to law at the option of the owner, from time to time, of that right. 31. Thus, while a taking under title of “possession and use” is intended for a determinate period of time, a taking under title of “public tenure” is for an indeterminate period of time, possibly forever, and the relevant recognition rent is to remain unaltered for its duration.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1
152,001-70720,ENG,GRC,CHAMBER,2005,CASE OF OURANIO TOXO AND OTHERS v. GREECE [Extracts],1,Violation of Art. 6-1;Violation of Art. 11;Pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - domestic proceedings,Loukis Loucaides,"9. The political party Ouranio Toxo (Rainbow), founded in 1994, has regularly taken part in elections since that date. Its declared aims include the defence of the Macedonian minority living in Greece. The other two applicants are members of the party's political secretariat. 10. In September 1995 the party established its headquarters in the town of Florina. The second and third applicants affixed to the balcony of the premises a sign indicating the party's name in the two languages spoken in the region: Greek and Macedonian. 11. According to the applicants, the opening of the headquarters and the affixing of the sign triggered a wave of violent protests by the town's inhabitants, but the police failed to take the appropriate measures to protect them against the various attacks to which they were subjected. 12. In particular, the offices were opened in early September 1995 and on 12 September 1995 priests from the church in Florina published a statement describing the applicants as “friends of Skopje”, driven by “anti-Hellenic and treacherous sentiments”. The statement continued as follows: “we call upon the people to join a demonstration to protest against the enemies of Greece who arbitrarily display signs with anti-Hellenic slogans, and we will demand their deportation.” 13. On 13 September 1995 the Florina town council held an informal meeting and, by a resolution published in the local press, decided to organise protests against the applicants. 14. On the same day the public prosecutor at the Florina Criminal Court ordered the removal of the sign on the ground that the inclusion of the party's name in Macedonian was liable to sow discord (Article 192 of the Criminal Code – see paragraph 23 below) among the local population. Police officers removed the party's sign without giving any explanation to the applicants, who then put up a new sign. That evening, according to the applicants, while they were inside the party headquarters a crowd of people, among whom they apparently recognised the mayor, the deputy mayor and certain town councillors, gathered in front of the building to shout threats and insults at them, such as “traitors”, “dogs”, “death to the dogs of Skopje”, “you're going to die”, and “we'll burn everything”. The crowd also allegedly demanded that the applicants hand over the sign. 15. On 14 September 1995 at about 1.30 a.m. a number of people allegedly attacked the party headquarters, and, after breaking down the door, assaulted those inside and demanded that they hand over the sign, which the applicants did. Another group entered the premises at approximately 4 a.m., threw all the equipment and furniture out of the window and set it on fire. According to the applicants, throughout these events they made a number of telephone calls to the police station located some 500 metres from the party headquarters, but were apparently told that no officers were available to come out. The applicants submitted that the public prosecutor's office took no action against those involved in the incidents. However, criminal proceedings for inciting discord were brought against four members of the party, including the second and third applicants, under Article 192 of the Criminal Code. The bill of indictment stated that “they had affixed to the party headquarters a sign on which, among other things, the word vino-zito (rainbow) was written in a Slavic language, and had thus sowed discord among the local inhabitants ...”. The applicants were committed for trial. 16. The trial took place on 15 September 1998 before a single judge in the Florina Criminal Court, who acquitted the applicants (judgment no. 979/1998). The court acknowledged that a crowd had gathered in front of the party headquarters and that one of the applicants had been beaten up. It found that there had also been criminal damage, which had culminated in the premises being set on fire. 17. On 5 December 1995 four party members, including the second and third applicants, lodged a criminal complaint and applied to be joined to the proceedings as civil parties, alleging that those responsible for the incidents had committed the following offences: incitement to discord (Article 192 of the Criminal Code), breach of the peace (Article 189), destruction of property (Article 381), criminal damage (Article 330), trespass (Article 334), threats (Article 333), insults (Article 361) and arson (Article 264). 18. On 24 November 1999 the Indictments Division of the Florina Criminal Court considered that there was insufficient evidence against the individuals named in the applicants' complaint and decided to discontinue criminal proceedings against them (order no. 30/1999). 19. On 10 December 1999 the applicants appealed. 20. On 4 April 2000 the Indictments Division of the Court of Appeal for West Macedonia dismissed the appeal (order no. 27/2000). 21. On 4 May 2000 the applicants appealed on points of law. 22. On 30 January 2003 the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation dismissed their appeal as inadmissible (order no. 176/2003). 23. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code read as follows: “1. Anyone who takes part in an unlawful assembly, ... attacks persons or property, or forcibly enters houses, dwellings or other premises belonging to another, shall be punished by a prison sentence of up to two years. 2. The perpetrators of such an attack and anyone who has incited another to commit the attack shall be punished by a prison sentence of at least three months. 3. The above-mentioned sentences shall be imposed unless the offence attracts a harsher sentence under a different provision.” “Anyone who, publicly or otherwise, provokes others to commit a violent act or sows discord among citizens, or incites citizens to do so, thus causing a breach of the peace, shall be punished by a prison sentence of up to two years, unless the offence attracts a harsher sentence under a different provision.”","['11', '6']",['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

POLAND,3,Violation of Art. 6-1;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses (domestic proceedings) - claim dismissed;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings,Nicolas Bratza,"7. The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Poznań, Poland. 8. On an unknown date in 1997 the applicant’s husband lodged a petition for divorce with the Poznań Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy). The applicant did not agree to a divorce and asked the court to dismiss the petition. 9. On 1 November 1997 the court made an interim periodical payments order requiring the applicant’s husband to pay 2,500 Polish zlotys (PLN) for maintenance in respect of their 3 children pending the proceedings. 10. On 21 September 1999 the Poznań Regional Court granted a decree of divorce. The court held that the marital breakdown was irretrievable and that both spouses had been at fault in respect of the breakdown of their marriage. It ordered that a final court fee (“wpis ostateczny”) of PLN 10,000 should be borne by the parties in equal shares (PLN 5,000 each). 11. On 20 October 1999 the applicant appealed against the divorce decree. She contested the findings made by the Regional Court in respect of the breakdown of the marriage and her being responsible for the marital breakdown. She also asked the court to rule that adultery on the part of her husband had been the main reason why their marriage had ended. 12. On 25 October 1999 the court ordered the applicant to pay a court fee of PLN 10,000 for lodging the appeal. 13. On 3 November 1999 the applicant made an application for an exemption from that fee. She argued, in particular, that a court fee for lodging an appeal constituted in fact an interim court fee (“wpis tymczasowy”) and that it should be estimated pursuant to section 11 of the Ordinance of the Minister of Justice of 17 December 1996 on Determining Court Fees in Civil Cases (Rozporządzenie Ministra Sprawiedliwości w sprawie określenia wysokości wpisów w sprawach cywilnych). It could not, therefore, exceed the maximum interim court fee in divorce proceedings, which was PLN 600. The applicant further submitted that she was in a difficult financial situation and that she was not able to pay the fee in question. She also stressed that the sum required from her was unusually high and out of any proportion to her standard of living. 14. On 8 November 1999 the Poznań Regional Court dismissed the application, considering that the applicant had “not shown that her financial situation made it impossible for her to pay the fee”. It held that she had not supplied a detailed statement concerning her financial situation. 15. On 20 November 1999 the applicant lodged an interlocutory appeal against that decision. She maintained that she had already submitted a declaration of means, pursuant to Article 113 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The Poznań Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) dismissed that appeal on 30 November 1999. That decision did not contain any reasons. 16. On 16 December 1999 the Poznań Regional Court ordered the applicant to pay, within seven days, a court fee of PLN 10,000 for lodging the appeal of 20 October 1999, on pain of it being rejected. 17. On 10 January 2000 the applicant lodged the second application for an exemption from court fees. She submitted that, given her financial means, she could pay only a sum not exceeding PLN 3,300. The applicant argued that she was not employed and that her only means were payments for her share in marital property received from her husband. She further maintained that she had not put money aside for the litigation since she had not expected the court fee to be so high. The applicant also stressed that the case was relatively simple but that important issues were at stake for her in the proceedings because they related to her civil status. Moreover, she pointed out that in other, more complex proceedings (concerning the marital property division) the Poznań Regional Court levied a moderate court fee of PLN 4,660 on each party. 18. On 13 January 2000 the Poznań Regional Court dismissed the application for a partial exemption from court fees and rejected the appeal against the divorce decree of 21 September 1999 for non-compliance with the court’s decision ordering the applicant to pay the court fee for lodging that appeal. The court held that the applicant had failed to indicate whether paying the full amount of court fees would entail a substantial reduction in her standard of living. 19. On 28 January 2000 the applicant lodged an interlocutory appeal against that decision. On 22 February 2000 the Poznań Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. It held that the applicant’s financial situation was good since she had already received PLN 300,000 from her husband on the basis of a lump sum order made in the proceedings concerning the division of their marital property, and that she would receive more payments. 20. On 20 March 2000 the applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court against that decision. She repeated the arguments raised in her earlier applications. 21. On 29 March 2000 the Poznań Court of Appeal ordered the applicant to pay a court fee of PLN 10,000 for lodging the cassation appeal. 22. On 5 April 2000 the applicant made an application for a partial exemption from court fees in the cassation proceedings. She submitted that she was able to pay the court fees not exceeding PLN 3,300. She further maintained that her financial situation was difficult because she was not employed and her only asset was the lump sum received from her husband; that sum, however, had to be disbursed not only for her needs but also for maintenance of her two minor children who lived with her. 23. On 17 April 2000 the Poznań Court of Appeal dismissed the application. The decision did not contain any reasons. 24. The applicant did not pay the fee of PLN 10,000. As a consequence, on 16 May 2000, the Poznań Court of Appeal rejected her cassation appeal on formal grounds. 25. On 26 May 2000 the applicant lodged an interlocutory appeal against that decision. On 30 May 2000 the Poznań Court of Appeal ordered the applicant to pay a court fee of PLN 2,000 for lodging the interlocutory appeal. 26. On 6 June 2000 the applicant made another application for an exemption from court fees in the interlocutory appeal proceedings. On 9 June 2000 the court again ordered her to pay a court fee of PLN 2,000. 27. On 9 June 2000 the Poznań Court of Appeal dismissed her application for an exemption from court fees in the interlocutory appeal proceedings. That decision was upheld on appeal on 12 July 2000. 28. The legal provisions applicable at the material time and questions of practice are set out in paragraphs 23-33 of the judgment delivered by the Court on 19 June 2001 in the case of Kreuz v. Poland (appl. no. 28249/95, ECHR 2001-VI; see also Jedamski and Jedamska v. Poland, no. 73547/01), §§ 29-39). Polish law provides however, for special regulations with respect to divorce proceedings. A petitioner is obliged to pay an interim court fee at the time of lodging a divorce petition with a court. Subsequently, the court levies a final court fee in a divorce decree. Section 31 of the Law of 13 June 1967 on Court Fees in Civil Cases (Ustawa o kosztach sądowych w sprawach cywilnych) (as amended) states, in so far as relevant: “1. In cases concerning non-pecuniary rights and in cases where it is impossible to establish the value of a claim at the time of lodging a statement of claim with a court, the president of the court shall order the party concerned to pay an interim court fee (wpis tymczasowy) for lodging his pleading. 2. The court levies a final court fee (wpis ostateczny...” Paragraph 11(6) of the Ordinance of the Minister of Justice of 17 December 1996, reads: “An interim court fee for lodging a divorce petition shall range from PLN 30 to PLN 600.”",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1
154,001-59414,ENG,SVK,CHAMBER,2001,CASE OF MARONEK v. SLOVAKIA,1,Violation of Art. 10;Pecuniary damage - financial award;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings,Christos Rozakis,"8. On 27 June 1991 the mayor of Bratislava allocated a single-room flat (“the flat”) to the applicant. It was at the disposal of the State-owned Tesla company, by which the applicant was employed at the time. The mayor’s decision entitled the applicant to have a contract signed, giving him the right to occupy the flat. However, the applicant was not able to sign the contract and move in, as it was occupied by A. 9. By a letter dated 4 March 1991 the Bratislava Staré mesto local council (Miestny úrad) informed A., in reply to his request that the right to occupy the flat be transferred to him, that the flat was at the disposal of Tesla. The letter further stated that A. was under no obligation to move out until he was provided with alternative accommodation. 10. On 18 March 1991 the Bratislava I Housing Administration (Bytový podnik) informed the housing department of the Bratislava Staré mesto local council that the flat had been occupied by A. without any justification since the death of the former occupant and that A. was registered as living in his parents’ flat, situated in the same house. On the same day a representative of the Bratislava I Housing Administration recorded the fact that the deceased occupant had been the only person living in the flat. 11. In a letter of 5 June 1991 a social welfare authority informed the housing department of the Bratislava Staré mesto local council that, between 1 June 1984 and 11 June 1990, A. had taken care of the occupant of the flat in return for remuneration from public funds. On 26 June 1990 the occupant of the flat had been placed in a welfare institution. The letter stated that, when social workers had visited the former occupant prior to her placement in the institution, nothing belonging to A. had been seen in the flat. 12. On 19 June 1991 Tesla brought an action in the Bratislava I District Court (Obvodný súd), claiming that A. should be ordered to move out. The action stated that, during a random inspection of the flat on 14 March 1991, it had been discovered that A. had illegally forced entry to the flat, had changed the lock and had prevented the representatives of Tesla and of the Bratislava I Housing Administration from entering. 13. Tesla further claimed that A. lived with his parents, whose flat was situated next door to the flat in issue. Since both flats had the same address, he had misled the local council when claiming that the right to occupy the flat in question should be transferred to him. Tesla submitted documentary evidence that A. was registered as living with his parents and that he had never occupied the flat in issue. The plaintiff argued that A. had no right to alternative accommodation. 14. At a later date the applicant joined the proceedings and claimed that he had the right to occupy the flat. A. counter-claimed that he was entitled to have the right to occupy the flat transferred to him. 15. On 1 January 1992 new legislation was enacted which started the process of denationalisation of State-owned flats. As a result, the flat ceased to be at the disposal of Tesla and the latter lost locus standi in the proceedings. 16. On 22 January 1992 the Western Slovakia Electricity Board informed the applicant that there had been no consumption of electricity in the flat as of the beginning of 1991. 17. On 29 September 1993 the applicant unsuccessfully requested the Bratislava Staré mesto local council to sign a contract with him for the use of the flat. 18. On 7 September 1994 the Bratislava I District Court discontinued the proceedings concerning the action brought by Tesla and the counter-claim filed by A. The court noted that in the course of the proceedings the ownership rights in respect of the flat had been transferred ex lege to the Bratislava Staré mesto municipality and that both the latter and A. had withdrawn their actions. 19. On 26 March 1996 the Bratislava I District Court granted A.’s application, filed on 28 May 1993, concerning his right to occupy the flat. The court held that A. had lived with the former occupant of the flat until her death on 2 July 1990. It concluded that A. had acquired the right to use the flat pursuant to Article 179 § 1 of the Civil Code as in force at the relevant time. 20. On 8 November 1991 the daily newspaper Smena published a full- page article written by a journalist on the applicant’s case. It was entitled “Absurd? Absurd!”. The article contained, inter alia, a description of the applicant’s unsuccessful attempt to enter the flat on 29 October 1991 and of the verbal exchanges between the applicant, on the one hand, and A. and his wife H., a public prosecutor, on the other. The article stated that the flat allocated to the applicant had been unlawfully occupied by A. and criticised the fact that the applicant had no possibility of using it. 21. On 17 December 1991 the Bratislava City Prosecutor brought disciplinary proceedings against H. on the ground that, during the applicant’s attempt to enter the flat on 29 October 1991, she had behaved in an inappropriate manner. The decision stated that the disciplinary proceedings had been brought on the basis of the article published in Smena on 8 November 1991 and of the explanations given by the persons involved. H. later resigned from her post of public prosecutor. 22. On 5 February 1992 the applicant addressed an open letter to the Prime Minister. It was entitled “For How Long?”, and its relevant parts read as follows: Smena on 8 November 1991, but since then little has changed. The flat is situated ... opposite the flat of [A.’s father], with whom his son has his permanent address at present. The flat was duly allocated to me by the Bratislava City Council on 27 June 1991. [A.] shamefully benefits from the fact that both flats have the same address (all flats in the same block have the same address) and prevents me from moving into my flat. In doing so, he is vehemently supported by his wife [H.], who is the principal occupant of another State-owned flat ... [A.] claims the right to occupy the flat on the basis of a document signed by the head of the housing department of the Bratislava Staré mesto local council on 4 March 1991 ... stating that [A.] does not have to leave the flat until he has been provided with alternative accommodation. However, [A.] has had alternative accommodation for a long time, namely his wife’s flat. He has acquired the right to occupy that flat automatically. Why has he not yet vacated the flat [allocated to the applicant]? [A.] and his wife lied to me when they said they had no place to live and alleged that because of this they would not vacate the flat. I point out that [H.] is a public prosecutor (!). If our newly born democracy has such people to represent the law, it will not outlive its childhood and we can bury it right away. The judiciary should first and foremost ensure that the law is respected and justice upheld in the State. But what is our judiciary like? Tesla brought an action against [A.] on 19 June 1991. The first hearing was scheduled for 27 January 1992 (!!!). Why? [A.] failed to appear. For how long will certain groups of people think that they detain all the power in the State (and act accordingly)? ... It is high time to show the world, before the second free election, that our government and society defend justice. I appeal to you. On 24 February 1992 at 11 a.m. the case of Tesla against [A.] will be heard in room no. 37 at the Bratislava law courts. Do not let democracy be trampled once more and the ideals underlying the promotion of the rule of law become empty words. P.S. I call upon all who have a similar problem to write to me. I hope that through our joint efforts we will be able to achieve more. May there be no need for it.” 23. The letter was signed by the applicant and gave his address. It also gave the full name and profession of both A. and H. A copy of it was posted up at several tram and bus stops in Bratislava. 24. On 21 February 1992 Smena published the applicant’s opinion on the case. Its contents were almost identical to the open letter of 5 February 1992. 25. On 28 February 1992 A. and H. lodged with the Bratislava City Court (Mestský súd) a civil action against the applicant to protect their good name and reputation. They later extended their action to Smena. 26. On 9 April 1993 a witness confirmed before the City Court that, at the relevant time, A. was living with his father. 27. On 23 June 1993 the Bratislava City Court found in favour of A. and H. It ordered the applicant to apologise in writing for damaging the plaintiffs’ honour. The applicant was further ordered to pay 100,000 Slovakian korunas (SKK) to each of the plaintiffs for non-pecuniary damage, to reimburse their lawyer’s fees and to pay the court fees. Smena was ordered to publish an apology, pay another SKK 100,000 to each of the plaintiffs and reimburse their legal costs. 28. The City Court noted that proceedings were pending before the Bratislava I District Court which concerned Tesla’s claim for the flat in issue to be vacated and A.’s counter-claim. The City Court held that the proceedings before the District Court raised difficult questions of fact and law. It further held that the applicant had not, so far, acquired the right to occupy the flat and noted that, according to a document issued by the housing department of the Bratislava Staré mesto local council on 4 March 1991, A. was under no obligation to vacate the flat until he obtained alternative accommodation. 29. In the City Court’s view, the opinions of the applicant and of a journalist which had been published in Smena on 8 November 1991 and 21 February 1992 had not been substantiated. The court considered that the applicant had also interfered with the plaintiffs’ right to protection of their personality by displaying his open letter of 5 February 1992 in public places or, as the case may be, allowing it to be published. The court held that the letter contained tendentious, distorted and unsubstantiated information which had damaged the plaintiffs’ personal integrity. 30. The City Court found that the damage had affected H.’s health, that, following the publication of the article of 8 November 1991, disciplinary proceedings had been brought against her and that, for the same reason, a loan had not been granted to A., who was a businessman. The family life of the claimants and of H.’s children had also been affected. 31. Both the applicant and Smena appealed. The applicant claimed, with reference to the documents included in the case file, that the information contained in his open letter of 5 February 1992 was true. In particular, he argued that, under the relevant law, A. had no right to occupy the flat in question. He also offered proof that, at the relevant time, A. had had a permanent address with his parents and that his wife had had the right to occupy another flat. 32. The applicant also pointed out that he could not have the contract for the use of the flat signed as the flat had been illegally occupied by A. He therefore maintained that his conclusion that A. had prevented him from moving into the flat was correct. Finally, the applicant alleged that, in any event, the interference in question had not had any defamatory effect within the meaning of Article 11 of the Civil Code and that the City Court had not indicated any relevant damage or circumstance within the meaning of Article 13 of the Civil Code on which its conclusion had been based. 33. On 16 November 1995 the Supreme Court (Najvyšší súd) dismissed the appeal. It considered that the evidence heard by the City Court showed that the information contained in the article of 8 November 1991, in the applicant’s opinion published in Smena on 21 February 1992 and in the applicant’s open letter displayed in public places did not correspond to reality and was objectively capable of affecting the plaintiffs’ personality rights. 34. The Supreme Court recalled that, after the allocation of the flat to the applicant, the relevant authorities had not signed a contract for its use with him as required by the law then in force and that the applicant had not requested that such a contract be signed. The Supreme Court therefore considered that the applicant’s allegation that A. had occupied the flat in question unlawfully and that he had shamefully benefited from the fact that his permanent address was the same as that of the flat in question had been tendentious and misleading as the proceedings concerning the right to occupy the flat in issue were still pending before the Bratislava I District Court. 35. In the Supreme Court’s view, the disclosure, in both the open letter and the opinion of 21 February 1992, of H.’s name and of the fact that she was a public prosecutor had grossly interfered with her right to protection of her personality. It concluded that the way in which the applicant had attempted to resolve his housing problem was inappropriate as he had had other lawful means of seeking redress. 36. In the judgment, the Supreme Court referred to the profession of the plaintiffs and found that the compensation the applicant had been ordered to pay was appropriate and corresponded to the non-pecuniary damage A. and H. had suffered. The applicant was ordered to reimburse to the plaintiffs the cost of the proceedings. The judgment was served on 17 January 1996. 37. On 14 February 1996 the applicant lodged a petition with the Constitutional Court (Ústavný súd). He alleged a violation of his constitutional rights, including freedom of expression, in the proceedings leading to the Supreme Court’s judgment of 16 November 1995. 38. On 27 February 1996 the Constitutional Court rejected the petition on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction to review or quash the ordinary courts’ decisions and to award compensation to the applicant. 39. Subsequently a bailiff started to enforce payment of the sums due by the applicant by attaching one-third of his salary. 40. The right to protection of a person’s dignity, honour, reputation and good name is guaranteed by Articles 11 et seq. of the Civil Code. 41. Under Article 11, any natural person has the right to protection of his or her personality, in particular of his or her life and health, civil and human dignity, privacy, name and personal characteristics. 42. According to Article 13 § 1 any natural person has the right to request that unjustified interference with his or her personality rights be stopped and that the consequences of such interference be eliminated, and to obtain just satisfaction. 43. Article 13 § 2 provides that, in cases where satisfaction obtained under Article 13 § 1 is insufficient, in particular because a person’s dignity and position in society have been considerably diminished, the person affected is entitled to compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage. 44. Under Article 13 § 3, the amount of compensation to be paid under Article 13 § 2 is fixed by the courts after considering the severity of the damage and the circumstances in which the person’s right was violated. 45. Article 179 § 1 of the Civil Code, as in force up until 31 December 1991, provides that the right to use a flat after the death of the occupant shall be transferred to persons who, inter alia, have lived in a common household with the person entitled to use it for at least one year before his or her death, provided that they have no flat of their own.",['10'],[],[],[],[],[],1
155,001-106188,ENG,UKR,COMMITTEE,2011,CASE OF SOBOLEV v. UKRAINE,4,Violation of Art. 6-1,Angelika Nußberger;Ganna Yudkivska,"4. The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Chernigiv. 5. On 29 May 1998 he lodged a claim with the Desnyanskyy District Court of Chernigiv (“the District Court”) against the Ministry of the Interior seeking damages for injuries caused to him by its employee Mr O. 6. From 18 December 1998 to 22 July 1999 and from 23 September 1999 to 1 November 1999 the proceedings were suspended pending the outcome of criminal proceedings against Mr O. 7. Following two remittals of the case for fresh examination, on 19 May 2004 the District Court partly allowed the applicant’s claim and awarded him certain amounts in damages. 8.

The applicants were born in 1979 and 1977 respectively and were serving their prison sentences in Ordu prison at the time of their applications to the Court. 9. On 11 November 1998 the applicants were arrested and taken into custody by police officers at the Anti-terror branch of the Sivas Security Directorate on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, namely the TDP. 10. On 18 November 1998 they were brought before a judge who ordered their remand in custody. 11. On 31 December 1998 the public prosecutor at the Erzurum State Security Court filed a bill of indictment with the latter charging the applicants under Article 168 § 2 of the Criminal Code with membership of an illegal organisation. 12. The first hearing, held before the Erzurum State Security Court on 12 January 1999, in the applicants’ absence, was taken up with procedural matters, such as the measures to be taken for securing the presence of the accused. 13. On 5 February 1999 the court heard the applicants. The first applicant stated that he accepted in part the accusations against him. In this respect he maintained, inter alia, that he had wanted to join the armed forces of the TDP and that he was apprehended, together with the coaccused, on his way to the rural area. The second applicant also stated, inter alia, that he was apprehended, together with the coaccused, before he had joined the rural cadre of the organisation. He maintained that he was a sympathiser of the organisation and not a member. Both applicants also repudiated the statements they had given to the police, claiming that they had been made under duress. 14. In the next hearing held on 2 March 1999 the applicants stated that they had nothing to say. On 23 March 1999 the court heard a witness and one of the coaccused. The witness stated that he knew only one of the accused and that he had loaned his car to him. The applicants maintained that, in view of the judgment of the European Court on Human Rights concerning State Security Courts, they were boycotting the court and were not going to give any statements. 15. In the next hearing held on 20 April 1999, the first applicant submitted that he was neither a member nor a participant in any activity of the organisation in question and that he had been apprehended prior to attending a meeting with members of the organisation. 16. In the hearings held on 18 May 1999 and 15 June 1999 the second applicant stated that he had nothing to say. The first applicant requested the rectification of some of his words contained in the previous minutes of the hearings. 17. In a hearing held on 13 July 1999 the civilian judge who had been appointed to replace the military judge sat as a member of the trial court for the first time. At this hearing and the next one held on 10 August 1999, the court took some procedural decisions and heard several of the co-accused, including the second applicant who maintained that he had nothing to say. 18. In a hearing held on 8 September 1999 the applicants submitted their written submissions in which they challenged, in particular, the veracity of their statements given in police custody. 19. On 5 October 1999 before the court two persons filed petitions to intervene as third-parties in the proceedings. The applicants reiterated their previous submissions. 20. At a hearing held on 12 October 1999 the court accepted the request for the third-party intervention of two persons. On the same day, the public prosecutor read out his observations on the merits. The public prosecutor, relying on the submissions of the applicants, the co-accused and the materials found during the applicants’ arrest, requested that the applicants be convicted and sentenced under Article 168 § 2 of the Criminal Code and Article 5 of Law no. 3713. The applicants’ request for an extension of time to submit their observations on the merits was granted by the court. 21. At each hearing, the court examined and dismissed the requests of the applicants to be released. 22. On 26 October 1999 the court heard the submissions of the applicants on the merits. The applicants also submitted four pages of written submissions. On the same day the Erzurum State Security Court convicted the applicants as charged and sentenced them to twelve years and six months’ imprisonment. 23. On 6 December 1999 the applicants appealed to the Court of Cassation against the judgment of the State Security Court. In their petition the applicants submitted arguments based on domestic law and, in particular, challenged the veracity of their statements to the police. 24. Following a hearing held on 5 June 2000, the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants’ appeal and upheld the judgment of the firstinstance court. This decision was pronounced, in the absence of the applicants’ representative, on 14 June 2000. 25. On an unspecified date, the applicants were released from prison. 26. The relevant domestic law and practice in force at the material time are outlined in the following judgments: Özel v. Turkey, no. 42739/98, §§ 20-21, 7 November 2002; Öcalan v.

TURKEY,3,No violation of Art. 2 with regard to abduction and killing;Violation of Art. 2 with regard to lack of effective investigation;No violation of Art. 3 and 5;Not necessary to examine Art. 10;Violation of Art. 13;No violation of Art. 14;No violation of Art. 18;Failure to comply with obligations under Art. 38-1-a;Not necessary to examine Art. 34;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings,Christos Rozakis,"8. The applicant, Mr İsak Tepe, is a Turkish citizen who was born in 1943 and is at present living in İstanbul (Turkey). At the time of the events giving rise to his application, the applicant was the provincial chairman of a political party, the DEP (Democracy Party), in the province of Bitlis (southeast Turkey). The application concerns the applicant’s allegations that his son, Mr Ferhat Tepe, was abducted and killed by undercover agents of the State. 9. The facts surrounding the death of the applicant’s son are disputed between the parties. 10. The facts as presented by the applicant are set out in Section 1 below. The facts presented by the Government are contained in Section 2. 11. A summary of the documents submitted by the parties is to be found in Part B. The witness evidence taken by the Court’s delegates at hearings conducted in Ankara is summarised in Part C. 12. In the beginning of July 1993, General Korkmaz Tağma, the commander of the Tatvan 6th Armoured Brigade, invited the provincial leaders of all political parties to a meeting at the army barracks. The applicant attended this meeting as the representative of the DEP and spoke in support of the cultural and democratic rights of the Kurdish population in Turkey. During the meeting, General Tağma claimed that there were no Kurds in Turkey and that those who had taken to the mountains were Armenians. He then asked the participants to report to him the names of the people who helped the PKK. The applicant replied to General Tağma that there were Kurds in Turkey as well as Turks and other minorities and that these people should be treated on the basis of equality in a democratic manner. He added that the denial of other people’s existence and the oppression or repression of others would not lead anywhere. General Tağma was furious and wanted to obtain information on the children of the chairmen, for example where they worked and how old they were. He warned the chairmen, including the applicant, that their children would be destroyed if they were not raised as loyal citizens of the State. 13. In the afternoon of 10 July 1993 the applicant’s son, Ferhat Tepe, born in 1974 and working as a reporter for the Özgür Gündem newspaper in Bitlis, was taken into police custody. No reasons were given for his arrest. He was released the same day in the afternoon. 14. On 28 July 1993 at around 7 p.m., while Ferhat was in the schoolyard of the Şemsi Bitlis primary school, a tall, bearded man who was known in the area to be a policeman, took him by the arm, put him in a car and drove away with him. Their car was followed by a white car, a Renault with the registration number 65 AD 095. There were two persons inside the white Renault, which was seen later that day parked next to Mahallebaşı police station. 15. Later on the same day, the applicant learned from İsmetullah Güzelsoy and Adnan Karslıoğlu that two plain-clothes policemen had made enquiries about Ferhat in the building where they lived. He went home in panic and realised that Ferhat was missing. 16. On 29 July 1993 at around 6 a.m. the applicant received a phone call from an anonymous person who claimed to be a member of an organisation called the “Ottoman Turkish Revenge Brigade” and said that they were keeping his son as a hostage. The caller said that Ferhat would be killed unless the applicant closed down the DEP’s Bitlis branch, released four French tourists who were in the hands of the PKK and paid one billion Turkish liras (TRL). The applicant said he could close down the Bitlis branch and try to find TRL 1 billion but had no power to secure the release of the French tourists, as he had no connection with the PKK. The caller warned the applicant that his son would be killed if the conditions were not met. 17. On the same day at 8 a.m. the applicant went with his wife and daughter to the Bitlis Security Directorate, where he told the director and the provincial governor of his suspicion that Ferhat had been abducted by contra-guerrillas operating within the State security forces. The governor and the director denied the existence of contra-guerrillas in Turkey and affirmed that the State did not commit murder. 18. On the same day the applicant applied to the Bitlis Public Prosecutor and asked that his home and office telephones be tapped in order to trace the caller’s number if another call was made. He also requested that all necessary action be taken to rescue his son. 19. On 30 July 1993 the applicant sent telegrams to the Prime Minister, the Minister of the Interior and the Governor of the state of emergency region asking for their aid in rescuing his son. 20. On 1 August 1993 the applicant and his wife went to Tatvan to talk to General Korkmaz Tağma at the brigade headquarters. They were told that the general was ill and had gone to Antalya. They were received by a colonel and attended a meeting at General Tağma’s office. During this meeting, Mrs Tepe stated that the bloodshed between Turks and Kurds had to stop and that she would sacrifice her son if this were to bring the animosity to an end. During the second or the third telephone call, the anonymous caller said that Mrs Tepe had spoken well at General Tağma’s office, which proves that the caller was either present at the meeting or had been informed by someone who had attended the meeting. 21. Subsequently, the applicant informed the Security Director that according to Fatih Olcay and Adnan Karslıoğlu, eye-witnesses to Ferhat’s abduction, the people who had taken Ferhat away were policemen. The applicant also said that there was evidence that the white Renault, which had followed the car in which Ferhat Tepe was abducted, belonged to the security forces. 22. On 4 August 1993 the applicant received another phone call at around 3 a.m. He immediately alerted the authorities while he was on the phone and asked them to identify the caller’s number. The conversation that followed was recorded. The person on the phone said that the applicant had failed to fulfil their conditions for the release of Ferhat since the DEP branch had not been closed down, and the applicant had failed to pay and had reported everything to the authorities. The caller told the applicant to bring TRL 1 billion to an address in the province of Elazığ. After listening to the recording, the Security Director told the applicant that the State could give him special bank notes, the serial numbers of which had been noted by the police, and told him to come back later for the bank notes. Later on the same day, when the applicant called again, the Director told him that he was having difficulty in obtaining the bank notes. 23. On the same day the applicant, together with four policemen and four of his relatives, went to the address in Elazığ indicated by the caller but could not find anyone. 24. Still on 4 August 1993, Ferhat’s dead body was found by a civil servant at the Lake Hazar, in Karakem. On the same day the public prosecutor and a medical expert examined the body. The report of their findings concluded that the cause of death was drowning and that there was no need for a systematic autopsy. It also stated that no signs of blows or the use of force on the body or of friction on the wrists and ankles had been detected. 25. On 5 August 1993 the applicant, who had not yet been informed of Ferhat’s death, applied to the Public Prosecutor enquiring whether the anonymous caller’s number had been traced. His application remained unanswered. 26. On 8 August 1993 the applicant received a third anonymous telephone call in which he was told that Ferhat’s body was at the morgue in Elazığ. Later that day the applicant discovered that the body had been buried on 5 August 1993 in the Elazığ cemetery for persons with no known relatives. 27. On 9 August 1993 the applicant identified Ferhat’s body, which had been exhumed by the authorities. In preparation for the funeral ceremony, the applicant washed the body himself in a mosque. He saw that his son’s testicles had been crushed and that there were marks on the arms, ankles, testicles and chest. He observed some cigarette burn marks on the body but no fractures. There were also deep wounds on the wrists and ankles showing that Ferhat had been bound hand and foot. The applicant alleged that, according to the eyewitnesses Mümtaz Çerçel, Ömer Aceban, Bahri Elçi, Miğdat Yaşar, Murat Koparan, Taner Şarlak, Erkan Dağdelen, Urfi Pasin and Rıza Demirtaş, who had been apprehended and questioned at the relevant time in the Diyarbakır Recruitment Office, Ferhat had been held there and tortured by members of the security forces between 28 July and 4 August 1993. Mümtaz Çerçel allegedly gave a statement, but withdrew it after being threatened by the police. 28. On 9 August 1993 the Sivrice Public Prosecutor issued a decision of non-jurisdiction, referring the investigation file to the Bitlis Public Prosecutor’s office. 29. At the funeral procession in Bitlis on 10 August 1993, there was a strong police presence. The police filmed those who attended, checked their identification and arrested fifteen persons. Later on the same day the police searched the applicant’s house. 30. On 12 August 1993 the Bitlis Public Prosecutor issued a decision of non-jurisdiction and referred the case to the Elazığ Public Prosecutor. 31. On 19 October 1993 the applicant sent a letter to the Committee of the Turkish Parliament on Murders Perpetrated by Unknown Persons, alleging that secret forces within the State security forces had killed his son. 32. On 2 November 1993 the applicant filed a petition with the Ministry of Justice, alleging that the abduction and killing of his son had been the acts of State forces and requesting an investigation into the matter. 33. On 16 March 1994 the applicant asked the Bitlis Public Prosecutor whether any inquiry into the killing of his son had been initiated. The Public Prosecutor told him there were some obstacles which he had been unable to overcome. On the same day the applicant went to the Bitlis Provincial Security Directorate and asked the assistant director why no investigation had been carried out. The Assistant Director said he did not have to explain anything to the applicant. 34. On 28 September 1994 the applicant applied again to the Ministry of Justice asserting that certain State security forces had been responsible for the abduction and death of his son. He requested that his allegations be investigated. 35. On 15 November 1994 the Elazığ Chief Public Prosecutor issued a permanent search warrant for the perpetrators of the killing of Ferhat Tepe. 36. Following the applicant’s complaints to the authorities, the police took tight security measures. The applicant, his office, his home and the DEP party building were put under constant surveillance. The police filmed the applicant’s colleagues and his fellow-townsmen who came to console him, and checked their identity cards. 37. In the meantime, the applicant’s family had been under intense pressure from the State authorities in relation to his political activities, the investigation he had personally carried out into the killing of his son and his application to the European Commission of Human Rights. The applicant’s daughter was remanded in custody in December 1993; his son was remanded in custody in 1994 for four months and is currently being tried for an offence which carries the death sentence; another of the applicant’s daughters was taken into custody in April 1994; four of the applicant’s nephews were remanded in custody in 1994, one of whom is being tried for an offence which carries the death sentence; the applicant’s brother was taken into custody in April 1994 and the applicant’s cousin has been in Elazığ Prison since 1994. On 24 February 1996 the applicant was arrested in Bartın and held in police custody for eight days in Bitlis. During his detention, the police officers asked him why he accused the State and why he had taken his complaints to the European Commission. They further threatened him and said among other things: “We will kill you just as we killed Ferhat. You are complaining to the infidels about our State. Are they the ones who will save you? Well, let them come and save you.” After being released, the applicant was acquitted of the charges by the Diyarbakır State Security Court. On 4 March 1996 the applicant was allegedly taken into custody in Bitlis on charges of aiding the PKK. He was released on an unspecified date after being interrogated. 38. On 19 February 1997 criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant on account of a speech he had made on a private TV channel, where he had alleged that his son had been murdered by the State. The applicant was charged with insulting the security forces. On an unspecified date, the applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to one year’s imprisonment. 39. In 1999 the applicant was arrested by police officers from the anti-terrorist department while entering the HADEP (People’s Democracy Party) party building in the Kadıköy district in Istanbul. He was kept in detention for one day. The police officers insulted him and threatened him with death. One of the police officers said that they would kill him just as they had killed Ferhat. The applicant complained to the Fatih Public Prosecutor in Istanbul, who decided to discontinue the proceedings, as there was no witness to confirm his allegations. 40. The applicant’s son Ferhat Tepe had been arrested on two occasions in 1991, as he was suspected of acting as a PKK courier. 41. The Government submitted that, according to various witnesses, on 28 July 1993 Ferhat had met someone in the schoolyard and had left with him of his own free will. 42. The authorities, at the request of the applicant, tapped the anonymous telephone call on 4 August 1993. Although a raid was carried out at the address mentioned in the telephone conversation, the premises were found to be empty. The authorities of the Ministry of the Interior nevertheless established that the residence searched belonged to reporters from Özgür Gündem in Elazığ and concluded that Ferhat’s killing had been the work of the PKK. 43. A report of 24 September 1993 from the Ministry of the Interior to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a letter of 16 November 1995 from the governor of Bitlis province indicate that the death of the applicant’s son was the work of the PKK. 44. In a letter of 10 November 1995 the Chief Public Prosecutor of Elazığ, charged with investigating Ferhat Tepe’s death, informed the Ministry of Justice that there was no indication or record of Ferhat’s having been taken into custody. Moreover, the custody records of the Bitlis Security Directorate contained no mention of him. 45. The parties submitted various documents concerning the investigation into the alleged abduction and killing of Ferhat Tepe. 46. On 30 March 1995 the applicant’s lawyer filed a petition with the Chief Public Prosecutor’s office in Bitlis requesting information as to what steps had been taken to find the perpetrators of the abduction and killing of Ferhat. 47. On 31 March 1995, subsequent to the Bitlis Chief Public Prosecutor’s decision of non-jurisdiction, the applicant’s lawyer submitted a petition to the Sivrice Public Prosecutor’s office in Elazığ via the Şişli Chief Public Prosecutor in İstanbul and requested information about the current state of the investigation into the impugned incident. 48. The custody records of the Diyarbakır provincial gendarmes headquarters for the period between 28 July and 4 August 1993 do not contain the name of Ferhat Tepe. 49. The anonymous telephone caller told the applicant that their conditions for the release of Ferhat had not been fulfilled. The applicant replied that he was unable to close down the Bitlis branch of the DEP since this required a decision by the central board in Ankara. The applicant was then told to bring TRL 1 billion by 5 p.m. the next day to an address in Elazığ if he did not want his son to be killed. The person in question warned the applicant not to inform the authorities. The applicant’s request to talk to Ferhat was rejected. 50. An autopsy was carried out on Ferhat’s body by the public prosecutor, a medical expert and the latter’s assistant in the presence of two witnesses and a clerk. It was observed that rigor mortis had not set in and the body had not yet turned blue, that water spurted out when the chest was pressed, that light violet-coloured cyanosis was perceptible on the ears and the nails of both the hands and the feet as a result of suffocation and that there were no signs of any blow or of the use of force on the body, nor were there any signs of friction on the hands and feet. It was therefore concluded that the cause of death was drowning and that there was no need for a systematic autopsy. 51. Nine photographs were submitted to the Court, taken when the body had been pulled out of the lake. No signs of any blows or ill-treatment are visible on the body in these photographs. 52. Following the finding of a corpse in Lake Hazar and its transfer to the morgue of Elazığ State Hospital, the applicant’s nephew, Mr Talat Tepe, went to the hospital to identify the body, which he recognised as being his uncle’s son, Ferhat Tepe. 53. This document states that Ferhat Tepe’s clothes and shoes were given to Mr Talat Tepe. 54. In his statement, Mr Aceban submitted that he had been kept in detention in a military detention centre in Diyarbakır between 25 July and 6 August 1993. He alleged that he had seen a detainee called “Ferhat” or “journalist” by the [officers] on the 3rd and 4th days of his detention. He described Ferhat as being a young man of about 18 or 19 years of age, with long, dark hair. 55. In this statement, the witness was asked to say what he knew about the incident. He replied that on 28 July 1993, at around 4 p.m., he had seen two plain-clothes men making enquiries about Ferhat. When one of them asked whether he knew Ferhat and the other residents of the building, the witness told them that Ferhat lived there and gave the names of the other residents. He claimed that he did not know whether these men were police officers but that they spoke Turkish with a western accent. 56. Mr Güzelsoy asserted that Ferhat had twice been taken into custody prior to his disappearance and that he was an irresponsible boy according to his father. The witness stated that on 28 July 1993, at 4 or 4.30 p.m., Mr Karslıoğlu had told him that two police officers had made enquiries about Ferhat. He had told Mr Karslıoğlu that this might have been an investigation in relation to the attack on police buildings which had taken place the previous day. Later that day, at approximately 5 p.m., he had seen Ferhat and had informed him that two police officers had been looking for him. Ferhat had replied to him that he had not done anything wrong. The next day, the witness had learned from the applicant of Ferhat’s disappearance. 57. On 28 July 1993, at around 6.30 or 7 p.m., the witness saw Ferhat Tepe talking to two women and one or two men next to a bakery. A white Renault Toros with the registration number “65” attracted the witness’s attention as its parking lights were on. There were two young men in the car. The driver was bearded and approximately 35-40 years old, while the man sitting next to him was about 25-30. According to the witness, these men could not have been police officers, otherwise he would have recognised them. The witness learned of the abduction of Ferhat Tepe when he went to the Social Democrat Populist Party building next day. 58. The witness was 17 years old at the relevant time. On 28 July 1993, at about 7 or 7.30 p.m., he was playing football with his friends in the Şemsi Bitlis primary school yard. He saw a bearded man aged about 20-25 waiting in the schoolyard. Two or three minutes later Ferhat arrived and they left the schoolyard arm in arm, like two friends. The bearded man did not use any force against Ferhat. 59. The witness was a police constable at the traffic registration and inspection department of Bitlis Security Directorate. On 28 July 1993 he was on duty, between 7.30 a.m. and 6 p.m., in charge of traffic control in the town centre. His car was parked in front of his house throughout the day. Next day he went to the city centre at around 1 or 1.30 p.m. and parked his car in front of the Çarşı police station. He returned home at 5 p.m. He did not lend his car to anyone on 28 and 29 July 1993. 60. In their statement addressed to the public, the witnesses alleged that they had been taken into custody on 24 July 1993 and kept in a detention centre in Diyarbakır where they were tortured for five days. During their detention, Mr Elçi heard some officers call out “Come on, journalist, it is your turn”. Mr Yaşar heard them asking a man “Journalist, where are you from?”, to which the reply was “I am from Bitlis”. Following their detention on remand they read in Özgür Gündem that a journalist called Ferhat Tepe had been killed under torture and that his corpse had been found in Elazığ. The witnesses submitted that Ferhat Tepe was the journalist whose voice they had heard during their detention.  61. The witnesses alleged that they had been kept in a military detention centre in Diyarbakır for twenty-two days. On the fourth or fifth day of his detention, Mr Dağdelen had seen a man called “journalist” by others. The journalist was chained by his hands to a water pipe and his body was bloody. He was unable to move or speak. Interrogators were torturing him and putting questions to him concerning his involvement with Özgür Gündem. Following their detention on remand, the witnesses read in Özgür Gündem that Ferhat Tepe had been killed. They identified him from his photos. They claimed that they were sure that they had seen Ferhat Tepe in the military detention centre in Diyarbakır. 62. The Chief Public Prosecutor informed the gendarmes and the police of Ferhat Tepe’s disappearance and asked them to verify whether he had been taken into custody for any offence. The Public Prosecutor further instructed that the whereabouts of Ferhat Tepe be determined, that those responsible for Ferhat’s disappearance be brought to his office and that all documents related to the case be sent to him. 63. The Deputy Gendarmes Commander informed the prosecuting authorities in this letter that Ferhat Tepe had not been taken into custody and that he had eventually been found dead. 64. The Elazığ Public Prosecutor requested the former authority to carry out a comprehensive investigation into the death of Ferhat Tepe and to inform him of the outcome. He requested the latter authority to find the person(s) responsible for the killing of Ferhat Tepe and to bring them to his office. 65. In this letter, the authorities of the Ministry of the Interior informed the Foreign Ministry of their conclusion that, having regard to the way in which Ferhat Tepe had been abducted and to the anonymous telephone calls, Ferhat must have been killed by members of the PKK, in a settling of scores within the organisation. They also noted that the allegation that the authorities had failed to respond to the applicant’s request for help was untrue since, following receipt of the applicant’s complaint, an investigation had been started and the photographs of Ferhat Tepe had been distributed to all the provinces and the security units had been alerted. 66. The Chief Public Prosecutor, Mr Süleyman Tutal, issued a permanent search warrant for the perpetrators of the killing of Ferhat Tepe. He requested the Elazığ Central Gendarme Commander and the Bitlis Chief Public Prosecutor to inform him every three months of any developments in the investigation. 67. In reply to the petition filed by the applicant’s lawyer on 31 March 1995, the Elazığ Public Prosecutor declared that the perpetrators of Ferhat’s killing had not yet been found and that the complainants would be informed of any developments in the investigation. 68. It is stated in this letter that there is no record of Ferhat Tepe’s having been taken into custody in Bitlis. According to the evidence given by the witnesses, Ferhat met a man in the Şemsi Bitlis Primary School yard and left the premises with that man arm in arm, without any force being used. It is also noted that, according to the autopsy report and the photos taken when Ferhat was found, there were no traces of ill-treatment and no blood stains on his body or his clothes, contrary to the allegations. 69. Following the lodging of the present application with the former Commission and its communication to the Government, in a letter of 27 October 1995 the authorities of the Ministry of Justice requested information from the Elazığ Chief Public Prosecutor’s office on the current state of the investigation into the applicant’s allegations. 70. The Chief Public Prosecutor wrote back stating that there was no evidence in support of the applicant’s allegations that Ferhat had been abducted, kept in custody and killed under torture by the security forces. He noted that the investigation into the murder was pending. He appended to his letter the post-mortem examination report, the autopsy and identification reports and copies of statements taken from İsmetullah Güzelsoy, Osman Pekdaşoğlu, Adnan Karslıoğlu, Fatih Olcay and the applicant as well as the decisions of non-jurisdiction, the permanent search warrant and 7 photos of Ferhat Tepe. 71. The subject of this letter was Ishak Tepe’s application to the European Commission of Human Rights. Having summarised the events, the governor concluded that the accusations made by the applicant were mere allegations since there was no evidence to substantiate them. He noted that on 4 August 1993 the applicant had received a phone call from a person who had told him to bring TRL 1 billion to an address in Elazığ if he wanted to rescue his son. When the applicant had gone to the address accompanied by police officers from the Elazığ Security Directorate, they had not been able to find anyone. Meanwhile, following inquiries made by the Elazığ police, it had been established that the residents at this address were two journalists from Özgür Gündem who had moved out 15 or 20 days before. The police had found the two journalists concerned and had taken statements from them. The governor concluded from these facts that the impugned incident had been a settling of scores within the PKK. 72. The Hozat Public Prosecutor took statements from the witnesses concerning the contents of the document signed by them on 16 August 1993 and entitled “To the Public”. 73. The witnesses admitted to having signed this document but claimed that the contents were untrue. Mr Şarlak and Mr Koparan submitted that a person called İrfan Güler, who was responsible for their prison ward, had written this document and made them sign it. They believed that nothing unpleasant would befall them if they signed the document. They further averred that they had not seen a person called Ferhat Tepe; nor did they know of how he had been killed. Mr Dağdelen, however, asserted that he did not remember when and where he had signed this document. 74. In this letter, the Chief Public Prosecutor was informed that statements had been taken from Murat Koparan, Taner Şarlak and Erkan Dağdelen, that these persons did not know Ferhat Tepe and that they had denied the contents of the document entitled “To the Public”. It was further noted that on 15 November 1996 a permanent search warrant had been issued to find the perpetrators of the killing of Ferhat Tepe. 75.

The applicant produced press releases concerning the alleged abduction and killing of Ferhat Tepe as well as the general situation in south-east Turkey at the relevant time. It was reported that Ferhat Tepe was the sixth correspondent of Özgür Gündem to be killed since the paper had gone into publication in May 1992. It was also stated that a previously unknown underground organisation calling itself the “Turkish-Ottoman Revenge Brigade” had claimed responsibility for the abduction of Ferhat in a telephone call to his family. 77. In a press release issued by Amnesty International on 6 March 1996, calling for urgent action, it was reported that the applicant, Ishak Tepe, had been taken into custody on charges of aiding the PKK. It was claimed that İshak Tepe had met the police officers against whom he had filed an official complaint after the murder of his son and his nephew and that he had been released after being brought before a court in Bitlis on 4 March 1996. Mr Tepe had not been subjected to any form of ill-treatment and had been able to see his wife and his lawyer while in police custody. 78. The facts of the case being in dispute between the parties, the Court conducted an investigation with the assistance of the parties. In this respect, three delegates of the Court took oral evidence between 9 and 14 October 2000 from twenty-four witnesses. A further nine witnesses had been summoned but did not appear for various reasons. The evidence given by the witnesses may be summarised as follows. 79. The applicant; who is currently living in İstanbul, was the provincial chairman of the DEP in Bitlis in 1993. He was at the same time a building contractor. During the taking of evidence in Ankara, in addition to his submission of the facts, the applicant stated the following. 80. At the relevant time, the applicant’s son Ferhat lived with him and helped him at his building site. Ferhat also worked for Özgür Gündem as a provincial reporter. He was not politically active. However, he had been taken into custody on two occasions before his disappearance. His first detention, on charges of aiding and abetting the PKK, took place three or four months before his release on 2 February 1992. The second arrest was probably on 12 July 1993, when he had not been taken into police custody. Ferhat was taken to the police station, where he met a police officer from the anti-terrorist department called Nurhan Şentürk, known as “sakallı” (the bearded one) in Bitlis and bearing the nickname “Hacı”. There were also two other men in the room whom Ferhat had never seen before. Ferhat felt that Hacı had taken him there to show him to these two newcomers. 17 or 18 days later Ferhat was abducted. 81. In the morning of 29 July 1993, at 6 a.m., the applicant received an anonymous phone call from a person claiming to belong to an organisation called the “Turkish-Ottoman Revenge Brigade” who declared that they were keeping his son as a hostage. In the applicant’s opinion, the anonymous person on the phone was General Korkmaz Tağma. He recognised the general’s voice from their meeting some 15 to 20 days earlier, when General Tağma had held a meeting with the provincial chairmen of all the political parties. 82. Immediately after this call, the applicant and his wife went to the Bitlis Security Directorate where they met the security director, Mr Orhan Ekinci, and the provincial governor of Bitlis, Mr Fethi Tunç. At the latter’s request, the applicant wrote a petition to the administrative authorities and to the public prosecutor complaining that his son had been abducted by contra-guerrillas operating within the State. He asked the authorities to take immediate action to find him. He refrained from naming any suspects at the time, in particular General Korkmaz Tağma, as he hoped to get his son back alive. The chief of police told the applicant that his son had not been taken into custody. 83. Later that day the applicant contacted Fatih Olcay, who had witnessed Ferhat’s abduction. Fatih told him that a tall person with a slight beard had held Ferhat by the arm and had taken him away. From his manner and the fact that he was holding a walkie-talkie in his hand, Fatih had deduced that he was a policeman. However, Fatih was unable to repeat these allegations at the police station since he was under pressure. 84. A construction worker called Suat also told the applicant that he had seen Ferhat being taken away in a car with the registration number 65 AD 095. The applicant did not see Suat again and later learned that Suat had gone to İstanbul. 85. The applicant’s nephew, Safiye Tepe, contacted former PKK members who had later become “confessors” (i.e. persons who cooperate with the authorities after confessing to having been involved with the PKK) for information about this case. One of them, A.İ., stated that General Korkmaz Tağma had ordered the killing of Ferhat. Some police officers and the JITEM (the gendarmes’ intelligence agency), led by Major Cem Ersever and the Turkish-Ottoman Revenge Brigade, were involved in this plot. A warfare specialist, Ahmet Demir, code name “Yeşil” (“the Green”) was at the head of this plot. Another “confessor “called Kenan – code name Cihan – confirmed that General Tağma had been involved in the killing of Ferhat. 86. A journalist, Soner Yalçın, published his interviews with Major Cem Ersever, the head of JITEM, who said that Ferhat Tepe and another person had been abducted by Ahmet Demir’s team, who had been assigned to the Diyarbakır-Bitlis-Muş-Bingöl zone. The JITEM headquarters were at the gendarmes’ interrogation centre in Diyarbakır, where Ferhat had been taken and murdered. 87. The witness is currently living in Manisa. He was on a visit to Bitlis at the end of July 1993. He stated that in the evening of 28 July 1993, around 5.30 or 6 a.m., he had been playing football in the yard of the Şemsi Bitlis primary school when he had seen Ferhat walk over. He noticed that a young man around the age of 2025, who was slightly bearded and dressed in civilian clothes was following Ferhat. They shook hands and walked away arm in arm, like ordinary friends. The witness did not see any cars around. The next day he heard that Ferhat was missing. 88. The witness denied the allegation that he had told the applicant about a tall bearded man, known in the area to be a policeman, or that this man had approached Ferhat, taken him by the arm and put him in a car.  89. The witness is a practising lawyer in İstanbul. He was the lawyer of Özgür Gündem at the relevant time and became the applicant’s counsel following the killing of his son. 90. The witness interviewed Mümtaz Çerçel in the Diyarbakır prison. The latter told him that he had seen Ferhat Tepe (“the journalist”) while being held in custody by the gendarmes. However, Mr Çerçel did not maintain his statement for fear of persecution. He also met Urfi Pasin and Rıza Demirtaş, who mentioned having seen Ferhat Tepe in custody. They were also afraid to testify before the authorities. They told the witness that a person by the name of Çetin Demirhan had also seen Ferhat and had even talked to him. The witness’s attempts to reach Mr Demirhan also failed as the latter was under threat of death because of this incident. The witness has never spoken to Murat Koparan, Taner Şarlak and Erkan Dağdelen. He did not take statements from Bahri Elçi and Migdat Yaşar. 91. The witness was the applicant’s business partner at the time. On 28 July 1993 he was told by Adnan Karslıoğlu that two police officers had made enquiries about Ferhat and the applicant. He reported this to Ferhat and asked him not to go anywhere. Ferhat was very calm about it and told him that he would be at home. That was the last time he had seen Ferhat. 92. The witness was the provincial commander of the Bitlis Gendarmes Headquarters at the relevant time. He was in charge of security and law-and-order services outside the borders of the municipality. He had no judicial authority. He was not involved in the investigation into the disappearance and murder of Ferhat, as the incident had taken place within the police authority zone. He heard from the intelligence services in the area that Ferhat was suspected at the time of being involved in money laundering business and that he might have been killed by the PKK. 93. The above witnesses were all police officers at the time in Bitlis occupying different functions in different departments, namely anti-terrorism, contraband and traffic. None of the witnesses were involved in the investigation into the disappearance and subsequent killing of Ferhat Tepe. Nor did they know of Ferhat, with the exception of Nurhan Şentürk, who said that Bitlis was a small town with a population of 28,000 where everyone knew each other. He had seen Ferhat before 28 July 1993, when the latter had made a statement at the police headquarters. Mr Şentürk did not remember when this statement had been made and what it had been about. However, the statement was sent to the Public Prosecutor, with a note that Ferhat was a PKK sympathiser. Mr Şentürk further stated that he had grown a beard at the time. He also stressed that Ferhat had never been taken into custody. 94. Mr Çavdar confirmed that Mr Şentürk’s nickname was “the bearded one”. Mr Pekdaşoğlu was first asked to give an account of what he had been doing on 28 July 1993 three days after the incident. He explained that he used to have a beige car at the time, with the licence plate number 65 DA 092, and that on 28 July 1993 this car had been parked in front of his house. He had not lent it to anyone. Eye-witnesses identified it as not being the vehicle involved in the incident. The car involved in the abduction had been a white Renault Toros. 95. The witness was a former member of the PKK, holding a leadership position in the organisation until he was caught on 28 December 1992. Benefiting from the confession law, he became a “confessor” in return for information he gave to the authorities. He was released in mid-1994. 96. In or around March 1992 the witness and two other local leaders of the PKK summoned Ferhat Tepe to Germak village in the Bitlis area and questioned him in relation to his activities. Subsequent to a second meeting held on 14 August 1992 in the mountains, in September 1992 Ferhat was sentenced to death on the grounds that he had been the cause of the killing of a female member of the PKK as a result of having had sexual intercourse with her and that he had used money collected for the PKK for his own purposes, i.e. to build a house and to buy a car. 97. The witness explained that the PKK carried out death sentences by shooting where security did not pose a problem. Alternatively, other methods were used, such as throwing people down from rocks and strangling or drowning. Subsequent to his arrest, the witness reported to the police that Ferhat was on the list of persons sentenced to death by the PKK. However, he did not know whether Ferhat had been killed by the PKK. 98. The witness was the commander of the Diyarbakır provincial gendarmes headquarters from 1992 to 1995. He was in charge of law and order and security in the rural areas within the boundaries of the province of Diyarbakır, which did not include the area around Bitlis. His organisation did not carry out any investigation into Ferhat Tepe’s death. He was asked by the Chief Public Prosecutor at the Diyarbakır State Security Court whether Ferhat Tepe had been taken into their custody. After examining the custody records and consulting his colleagues in all the gendarmes stations under his command, the witness reported back that no one of that description had been brought to their premises or taken into custody or involved in any incident in their region. 99. The witness admitted to mistakes or negligence in the keeping of the custody records at headquarters. He stated that, for security reasons, it was routine practice to blindfold people taken into custody when they arrived at headquarters. The blindfold was taken off once they were inside and, after that, they were never blindfolded. While he was serving in Diyarbakır, the witness heard some rumours about a Turkish-Ottoman Revenge Brigade, but there was never any concrete evidence of the existence of such an organisation. 100. The witness had been the head of the interrogation unit composed of ten officers at the Diyarbakır provincial gendarmes headquarters. His recollection of Ferhat Tepe’s death was limited to the question asked by his commander, Mr Eşref Hatipoğlu, namely whether Ferhat had been taken into custody. He consulted the records and told his commander that Ferhat had not been detained. 101. The witness was not in charge of keeping the custody records and there was an officer specifically responsible for that duty at the headquarters. He asserted that detainees were never blindfolded during interrogation and that there was never any physical contact between the interrogators and those detained. He denied the suggestion that anybody had been tortured in the interrogation unit, since medical certificates were issued at the end of the custody period. He further stated that, at the relevant time, there had been twenty detention cells. If more than twenty detainees were brought in, they were transferred to other districts and held there until a cell became vacant in Diyarbakır. 102. The witness was the Bitlis Security Director in command of a staff of eight hundred people at the relevant time. On 29 July 1993 he was on duty when the applicant, along with his wife and daughter, came to the Bitlis police headquarters to tell him that he feared for the life of his son who had disappeared. The witness reassured the applicant, saying that he had checked with his colleagues that Ferhat had not been taken into their custody. He explained that every morning he received a list of the persons taken into custody by any of the security forces in his zone. This list was drawn up by the provincial police headquarters in the form of a report, listing the incidents of the day in the municipal area. It was then sent to the governor’s office. A similar report was submitted to the governor by the gendarmes responsible for rural areas. There were also daily security meetings held in the province with the Governor, which the witness and Yüksel Özçelik attended. 103. The witness assigned a police superintendent to the task of keeping in touch with the Tepe family. Statements were taken from all the persons named by the family. The information regarding the disappearance of Ferhat was communicated by radio and telex to all provinces in Turkey. The witness confirmed that he had been asked by the applicant to trace phone calls, but this procedure had not led anywhere, as in 1993, it was not possible to trace calls made from public telephone booths. Unable to obtain traceable bank notes from the National Police Headquarters owing to bureaucratic obstacles, he could not give cash to the applicant to pay the ransom. 104. The witness was the doctor who signed the autopsy report. At the relevant time, he was a general practitioner working at the district health centre in the Sivrice district of Elazığ. He was not a pathologist qualified to conduct autopsies. He had, however, witnessed many autopsies carried out on persons drowned in Lake Hazar. He claimed that there were ten to fifteen drowning incidents per day at the relevant time. 105. The witness said he remembered the incident very well. He arrived at the scene of the incident at about 8 a.m. on 4 August 1993. After examining the body, he concluded that it was definitively a case of death by drowning which had occurred within a maximum of four hours. The deceased’s lips were discoloured as though he had been deprived of oxygen and cyanosis had occurred. Rigor mortis had not set in. He could not see any scratches on the body. Nor did he find any fracture or bruising thereon. There was no sign that the deceased had been either in a fight or hit, beaten, pushed, thrown or killed, or that the body had been brought and thrown into the water. However, the witness saw some marks on the neck and diagnosed them as being erythema, an allergic reaction. He did not think it was necessary to note this in the autopsy report. The witness considered it unnecessary to call in a pathologist or to apply to superior authorities for an autopsy, since he had no doubt that it was a case of ordinary drowning. 106. The witness found the body on 4 August 1993, at 7.30 a.m. He had gone to the lake early in the morning for fishing. He saw the body half submerged in the water. The body had underpants on. He pulled the body onto the shore and left it right by the edge of the water. He did not notice any particular features on the body, such as bloodstains or marks of any kind. He saw that there were some clothes – trousers and a shirt which had been placed on the shoes – about half a metre from the shore. He then went to a petrol station and called the Sivrice gendarmes station. He stayed on the spot for about an hour and a half and statements were taken from him by the public prosecutor. 107. The witness, who signed the autopsy report, was at the time the Sivrice Public Prosecutor in Elazığ. Although it was not the usual practice, he had photographs taken of the body for identification purposes following the post-mortem examination. At the beginning of his testimony, the witness stated that he had not taken any steps to see whether the body he had found matched any person reported as missing. After consulting the doctor and having heard the witnesses, he decided that a systematic autopsy was unnecessary as there was nothing suspicious about the incident and that he had come across similar drowning incidents in the past. However, he had not encountered a case where the identity of the victim was unknown and the identity card missing. Later he said that he had instructed both the gendarmes and the police to investigate whether anyone had reported a relative missing. He had the body sent to the morgue of the Elazığ State Hospital as there was no suitable morgue in Sivrice. He was informed later that the body had been buried because of a technical problem in the morgue. However, he did not know when the body had been buried and who had ordered the burial. He did not know anything about Ferhat Tepe until Ferhat’s cousin, a lawyer, had applied to their office five days after the incident. When the witness learned that the scene of the incident fell within the territorial jurisdiction of Elazığ, he issued a decision of non-jurisdiction on 9 August 1993. 108. The witness was the public prosecutor in Elazığ, in charge of the investigation into the death of Ferhat Tepe. In the investigation file and the autopsy report he received, there were no findings indicating that the deceased had been tortured. There was no sign of any ill-treatment on the photographs. In their statements made at the Hozat Public Prosecutor’s office, Mr Murat Koparan, Mr Taner Şarlak and Mr Erkan Dağdelen had denied the allegations contained in the declarations addressed “To the Public”. There was therefore no evidence that Ferhat had been abducted or killed under torture. The witness considered the incident to be a case of ordinary death by drowning and, accordingly, did not deem it necessary to conduct any further investigation. 109. The witness was the Chief Public Prosecutor in Bitlis at the time of the events. He was on judicial leave from 20 July to 6 September 1993. On 28 September 1993 he was appointed as a judge to a court in İstanbul. He could not contribute to the elucidation of the facts. 110. The witness was one of the two Public Prosecutors who were deputies to the Chief Public Prosecutor in Bitlis. He was on duty when the Chief Public Prosecutor was on leave. He issued a decision of non-jurisdiction on 12 August 1993 after the body had been found and sent the preliminary investigation file he had prepared to the Sivrice Chief Public Prosecutor’s office. He said the case had struck him as a unique and unusual one at the time. However, he could not remember whether he had done anything about the case, but said: “I must have started the investigation”. 111. The witness was a trainee public prosecutor in Ankara in July and August 1993. He did not take part in any investigation concerning Ferhat Tepe. 112. The witness was assigned to the Bitlis office as a public prosecutor on 24 February 1993. He was on duty in July and August 1993 along with his colleague, Mr Erdal Poyraz. He confirmed that Mr Poyraz had been in charge of the investigation while he personally had not been involved in it. He did remember, however, that there had been some incidents during the funeral. 113. On 20 July 1993 all three witnesses were arrested on suspicion of aiding and abetting members of the PKK and taken into custody at the Hazro gendarmes headquarters, where they stayed for two days. The witnesses were then taken to Diyarbakır and kept at the gendarmes headquarters between 22 July and 13 August 1993. On the latter date, the Diyarbakır State Security Court ordered the witnesses’ detention on remand and they were transferred to Diyarbakır E-type Prison. They stayed in the same cell for two months until the State Security Court ordered their release following acquittal. 114. The witnesses denied the suggestion that, during their detention, they had seen Ferhat Tepe being tortured or killed. Nor had they known of him or heard of a journalist being detained in the same place with them. As regards the document addressed to the public which they had signed in prison, the witnesses alleged that the persons in the ward who had told them to sign this document had tricked them into it, as it contained statements which they had never uttered. They thought that it was a document prepared for the purposes of their defence in court; they had not read the document before signing it. The witnesses further stressed that they had been very young at the relevant time (16, 20, and 14 years old respectively) and that the persons who had made them sign the document had taken advantage of their youth and inexperience. The witnesses finally claimed that they had learned of the content of the impugned document when the Hazro Public Prosecutor had taken their statements about it on 26 February 1996. 115. The Turkish Criminal Code (Türk Ceza Kanunu), as regards unlawful killings, has provisions dealing with unintentional homicide (Articles 452 and 459), intentional homicide (Article 448) and murder (Article 450). 116. Under Articles 151 and 153 of the Turkish Code of Criminal Procedure (Türk Ceza Muhakemeleri Usulü Kanunu; hereinafter “CCP”), complaints in respect of these offences may be lodged with the public prosecutor. The complaint may be made in writing or orally. In the latter case, such a complaint must be recorded in writing (Article 151 CCP). The public prosecutor and the police have a duty to investigate crimes reported to them (Article 153 CCP). 117. If there is evidence to suggest that death is not due to natural causes, police officers or other public officials who have been informed of that fact are required to advise the public prosecutor or a criminal court judge (Article 152 CCP). By Article 235 of the Criminal Code, any public official who fails to report to the police or a public prosecutor’s office an offence of which he has become aware in the exercise of his duties is liable to imprisonment. 118. A public prosecutor who is informed by any means whatsoever of a situation that gives rise to the suspicion that an offence has been committed is obliged to investigate the facts by conducting the necessary inquiries to identify the perpetrators (Article 153 CCP). The public prosecutor may institute criminal proceedings if he or she decides that the evidence justifies the indictment of a suspect (Article 163 CCP). If it appears that the evidence against a suspect is insufficient to justify the institution of criminal proceedings, the public prosecutor may close the investigation. However, the public prosecutor may decide not to prosecute if, and only if, the evidence is clearly insufficient. 119. In so far as a criminal complaint has been lodged, a complainant may file an appeal against the decision of the public prosecutor not to institute criminal proceedings. This appeal must be lodged within fifteen days after notification of this decision to the complainant (Article 165 CCP). 120. Article 125 §§ 1 and 7 of the Turkish Constitution provides as follows: “All acts of decisions of the administration are subject to judicial review ... The authorities shall be liable to make reparation for all damage caused by their acts or measures.” 121. This provision is not subject to any restriction even in a state of emergency or war. The second paragraph does not require proof of the existence of any fault on the part of the administration, whose responsibility is of an absolute, objective nature, based on a concept of collective liability and referred to as the theory of “social risk”. Thus, the administration may indemnify individuals who have suffered damage from acts committed by unknown or terrorist authors when the State may be said to have failed in its duty to maintain public order and safety, or in its duty to safeguard individual life and property. 122. Under Article 41 of the Civil Code, anyone who suffers damage as result of an illegal act or tort may bring a civil action seeking reparation for pecuniary damage (Articles 41-46) and non-pecuniary damage. The civil courts are not bound by either the findings or the verdict of the criminal court as to the issue of the defendant’s guilt (Article 53).","['13', '2']",[],[],"['14', '18', '2', '3']",[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Brzeg, Poland. 5. On 26 January 2000 the applicant was remanded in custody on a charge of robbery. On 31 July 2000 he was convicted as charged and sentenced to a prison term. 6. The applicant appealed against his conviction but his appeal was dismissed on 20 December 2000 by the Warsaw Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny). 7. On 13 March 2002 the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) dismissed the applicant’s cassation appeal. 8. The first page of the applicant’s first letter to the Court of 26 May 2000, which was delivered to the Court on 19 July 2000, bears a stamp: “Censored on – [a handwritten date]: 14.07.2000, judge: [an illegible signature]” (Ocenzurowano dnia – 14.07.2000, sędzia [podpis nieczytelny]). The same stamp and signature are marked on the third page of the letter. Moreover, two words have been obscured with a felt-tip pen on the last page of the letter. The left side of the envelope in which the letter was delivered was opened and subsequently sealed with Sellotape. 9. Rules relating to means of controlling correspondence of persons involved in criminal proceedings are set out in the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences (Kodeks karny wykonawczy) (“the 1997 Code”) which entered into force on 1 September 1998. 10. The relevant part of Article 103 § 1 of the Code provides as follows: “Convicts (...) have a right to lodge complaints with institutions established by international treaties ratified by the Republic of Poland concerning the protection of human rights. Correspondence in those cases (...) shall be sent to the addressee without delay and shall not be censored.” 11. Article 214 § 1 reads as follows: “Unless exceptions are provided for in the present Chapter, a detainee shall enjoy at least the same rights as are secured to a convicted person serving a sentence of imprisonment under the ordinary regime in a closed prison. No restrictions shall be applied to him except such as are necessary to secure the proper conduct of criminal proceedings, to maintain order and security in a remand centre and to prevent demoralisation of detainees.” 12. Article 217 § 1 reads, in so far as relevant, as follows: “(...) detainee’s correspondence shall be censored by [the authority at whose disposal he remains], unless the authority decides otherwise.” 13. Article 242 § 5 reads as follows: “The prohibition of censorship shall also mean the prohibition of acquainting oneself with the content of the letter.” 14. On 1 September 1998 the Rules of Detention on Remand (Rozporządzenie Ministra Sprawiedliwości w sprawie regulaminu wykonywania tymczasowego aresztowania) entered into force. § 36 of the Rules provides: “A detainee’s correspondence, including correspondence with the international institutions for the protection of human rights, which act on the basis of international agreements ratified by the Republic of Poland, with the Ombudsman and public and local government institutions, is mailed through the intermediary of the authority at whose disposal he remains.” § 37 provides: “1. If the authority at whose disposal [a detainee] remains ceases to censor correspondence, it shall be subject to the supervision or censorship by the prison administration, except for cases referred to in Article 73 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Articles 102 (11) and 103 of the Code [of Execution of Criminal Sentences]. 2. The correspondence of a detainee shall be supervised by the administration of the detention centre when necessary in the interest of protecting social interest, the security of a detention centre or requirements of personal re-education. 3. The supervision referred to in paragraph 2 shall be executed by controlling the content of the correspondence and acquainting oneself with its wording. 4. The correspondence referred to in Articles 8 § 3, 102 (11) and 103 § 1 of the Code [of Execution of Criminal Sentences] may be only subjected to the control of its content [kontrola zawartości], which shall take place in the presence of a detainee.” 15. § 38 provides: “2. Censorship shall mean deleting a part of text or making it illegible, whereas seizing correspondence shall mean not transmitting it to a detainee and placing it in his file.”","['34', '8']",[],[],[],[],[],1
159,001-57838,ENG,ESP,CHAMBER,1993,CASE OF RUIZ-MATEOS v. SPAIN,2,Violation of Art. 6-1;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed,C. Russo;D. Ruiz-Jarabo Colomer;John Freeland;N. Valticos;R. Pekkanen,"8. Mr José María Ruiz-Mateos, a businessman, Mr Zoilo Ruiz-Mateos, Mr Rafael Ruiz-Mateos, Mr Isidoro Ruiz-Mateos, Mr Alfonso Ruiz-Mateos and Mrs María Dolores Ruiz-Mateos are brothers and sister. They are all of Spanish nationality. In 1983 they held 100% of the shares in RUMASA S.A., the parent company of the RUMASA group, which comprised several hundred undertakings. RUMASA S.A.’s holding in these undertakings varied from one to the other. 9. By a legislative decree of 23 February 1983 the Government ordered the expropriation in the public interest of all the shares in the companies comprising the RUMASA group, including those of the parent company (Article 1). The State, which was the beneficiary of this measure, was to take immediate possession of the expropriated property through the intermediary of the Directorate General for National Assets (Article 2). The legislative decree was confirmed on 2 March 1983 by the Chamber of Deputies. It gave rise to an appeal to the Constitutional Court (recurso de inconstitucionalidad, Article 161 para. 1 (a) of the Constitution, see paragraph 26 below), as a group of deputies contested its constitutional validity. The Constitutional Court dismissed the deputies’ appeal by a judgment of 2 December 1983, adopted with the President’s casting vote; in a dissenting opinion, six members of the court expressed the view that the expropriation procedure followed was contrary to the Constitution. 10. In the meantime Law no. 7/1983 of 29 June 1983, published a day later in the Official State Gazette (Boletín Oficial del Estado), had replaced the legislative decree. Articles 1 and 2 thereof ordered the immediate expropriation and transfer of possession of the companies concerned in similar terms to those of the legislative decree (see paragraph 9 above). The aim of these measures was to protect the public interest because, in order to finance the group’s companies, its banks had taken risks considered to be disproportionate in relation to their solvency, thereby jeopardising ""the stability of the banking system and the interests of the depositors, employees and third parties"". 11. Between the publication of the legislative decree and that of Law no. 7/1983, Mr José María Ruiz-Mateos had, on 8 April 1983, both on his own behalf and on that of the other applicants and RUMASA S.A., instituted summary proceedings for the restitution of the expropriated property (interdicto de recobrar). On 11 April the Madrid First-Instance Court (juzgado de primera instancia) no. 18 - composed of a single judge - declared the application inadmissible on procedural grounds. The first applicant had failed to adduce evidence establishing that he had been divested of the assets as alleged and showing that prior to the impugned measure the assets in question had been in his possession. 12. On 9 May 1983 Mr José María Ruiz-Mateos lodged a further application concerning 50% of the RUMASA S.A. shares. The other five applicants followed suit on 27 May with regard to the remaining shares, each claiming 10%. The two cases were allotted respectively to Madrid First-Instance Courts nos. 18, which reopened the file, and 21. 13. The Counsel for the State (Abogado del Estado), representing the Government, obtained, on 4 and 5 July respectively, a stay of three months in each of the two sets of proceedings to enable him to consult his superiors. The applicants’ appeals against those decisions were dismissed on 16 and 18 July. On 21 September the Counsel for the State applied for the joinder of the two sets of proceedings. Court no. 18 acceded to this request on 22 November, having received the consent of Mr José María Ruiz-Mateos on 18 November. On 27 March 1984 Court no. 21 ordered that the file of the proceedings before it be transmitted to Court no. 18, the other five applicants having given their agreement on 23 March. Court no. 18 received the file on 9 May. 14. On 21 March 1984 the first applicant had requested Court no. 18 to refer to the Constitutional Court a question on the conformity of Articles 1 and 2 of Law no. 7/1983 (see paragraph 10 above) with Articles 14, 24 and 33 of the Constitution (cuestión de inconstitucionalidad, see paragraphs 25, 26 and 27 below). The court held hearings on 18 June and 17 September 1984. On 19 September the judge invited the parties to submit observations on this matter within ten days (Article 35 of Institutional Law no. 2/1979 on the Constitutional Court, ""Institutional Law no. 2/1979"", see paragraph 27 below). On 29 September the Counsel for the State replied that the question was not material to summary proceedings for the examination of an action to recover possession. On 1 October the Attorney General’s department also expressed its opposition to the motion. On the same date in support of their claims the applicants submitted two memorials, respectively eighty-five and thirty-seven pages long. 15. By a decision (auto) of 5 October 1984 Court no. 18 referred to the Constitutional Court the question of the conformity of the above-mentioned articles of Law no. 7/1983 with Article 24 para. 1 of the Constitution inasmuch as it had not been open to the applicants either to invoke in the courts their right of property in respect of the assets expropriated by legislative action or to challenge the necessity of seizing them. In the opinion of the first-instance court, the decision on the merits of the dispute depended on the validity of the provisions in issue. 16. The Constitutional Court found the question admissible on 17 October 1984; it then gave notice of the question to the Chamber of Deputies, the Senate, the Government and the Attorney General (Fiscal General del Estado), who were each entitled to file observations within the same fifteen-day period (Article 37 para. 2 of Institutional Law no. 2/1979, see paragraph 27 below). The Constitutional Court received the observations of the Attorney General’s department and of the Counsel for the State on 5 and 6 November respectively; on 12 November the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies indicated that the Chamber did not intend to submit observations. 17. On 27 January 1986 Mr José María Ruiz-Mateos complained of the delay in the proceedings; he relied in this connection on Article 24 para. 2 of the Constitution (see paragraph 25 below) and Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 6-1). The Constitutional Court joined the application (recurso de queja) to the file on 30 January, but did not pursue the matter because the applicant lacked locus standi. On 7 February he again applied to the Constitutional Court, alleging that the decision of 30 January infringed Article 24 of the Constitution. He also maintained that he had locus standi in respect of the constitutional proceedings by virtue of his status as a party in the main proceedings. On 21 February the Constitutional Court confirmed its earlier decision. 18. Following the election to the Constitutional Court of six new members, on 26 March 1986 Mr José María Ruiz-Mateos challenged two of these judges for lack of impartiality. He claimed that one of them was well-known to be a friend of the Prime Minister and the other had already been involved in the case as adviser to the Minister of Justice and had, among other things, participated in preparing the speech to Parliament on the expropriation of RUMASA. On 10 April the Constitutional Court dismissed the challenge on the ground that the applicant lacked locus standi. 19. By a judgment of 19 December 1986, it held that Articles 1 and 2 of Law no. 7/1983 were compatible with Article 24 of the Constitution. It found that legislative expropriation - even by means of a special statute concerning a specific case - was not contrary to the Constitution. Although this admittedly meant that the persons concerned suffered restrictions on the judicial protection of their rights, as they could not challenge in the courts the necessity of the seizure of their assets, it was always open to them to contest the measure in the administrative courts and to ask those courts to refer a question to the Constitutional Court on the constitutional conformity of such action. In addition an appeal (amparo), founded on the right to equality before the law, lay against the final decision of the administrative courts. Finally, the law in issue had in no way deprived the persons concerned of their right to appropriate compensation, a right which they could assert before the Provincial Expropriation Board (jurado provincial d’expropiación) - the competent administrative body -, and then in the administrative courts. Two judges expressed the view, in a dissenting opinion, that the expropriation procedure used had deprived the applicants of their right of access to the courts. 20. This judgment was communicated to Court no. 18 on 22 December 1986. The following day that court dismissed the action for restitution. 21. On 27 December 1986 the applicants appealed to the Audiencia provincial of Madrid, which declared the appeal admissible on 5 February 1987. The examination of the appeal began on 26 June 1988. The court communicated the file to each of the parties in turn, each party having ten days to study it. The hearing was initially set down for 21 October, but was adjourned at the request of the applicants’ lawyer, who was unable to attend. As soon as the hearing opened on 28 November, the applicants sought a stay of the proceedings until the European Commission and Court of Human Rights had had an opportunity to rule on their application to Strasbourg. In the alternative, they requested the Audiencia provincial to refer to the Constitutional Court a new question concerning the compatibility of Articles 1 and 2 of Law no. 7/1983 with Articles 14 and 33 para. 3 of the Constitution (see paragraph 25 below). The court ordered an adjournment so as to allow the applicants to submit documents in support of their first request. On 19 December 1988 they supplied a translation of the correspondence from the Secretariat of the Commission. After a further hearing on 13 February 1989, the court refused to stay the proceedings. On 7 July 1989 it overruled the applicants’ objection to this decision. 22. On 14 February 1989 it had invited the parties and the Attorney General’s department to give their views on whether the above-mentioned question as to constitutional conformity should be submitted to the Constitutional Court (Article 35 para. 2 of Institutional Law no. 2/1979, see paragraphs 21 above and 27 below). After having received their comments, the Audiencia provincial referred the question to the Constitutional Court on 9 July 1989. The latter court declared it admissible on 31 October 1989, then communicated it to the institutions of the State listed in Article 37 para. 2 of Institutional Law no. 2/1979 (see paragraph 27 below). The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies replied on 17 November that the Chamber did not intend to submit observations; on the same day and the following day respectively, Counsel for the State and the Attorney General’s department filed their submissions. 23. By a judgment of 15 January 1991 the Constitutional Court found the contested articles of Law no. 7/1983 to be compatible with Articles 14 and 33 para. 3 of the Constitution. Two judges expressed a dissenting opinion. 24. The Audiencia provincial was notified of this on 25 January 1991 and set down a hearing for 22 February. On that occasion the applicants made a further application for the proceedings to be stayed. The court dismissed their appeal by a judgment of 25 February. On 6 March the applicants lodged an application for the interpretation of that judgment; their application was dismissed on 11 March 1991. 25. The relevant Articles of the 1978 Constitution are worded as follows: ""Spaniards shall be equal before the law and may not be discriminated against in any way on account of birth, race, sex, religion, opinion or any other condition or personal or social circumstance."" ""1. Every person has the right to obtain the effective protection of the judges and the courts in the exercise of his legitimate rights and interests, and in no case may he be denied that protection. 2. Likewise, all persons have the right of access to the ordinary courts as predetermined by law; to the defence and assistance of a lawyer; to be informed of the charges brought against them; to a public trial without undue delays and with full guarantees; to the use of evidence pertinent to their defence; not to make self-incriminating statements; not to declare themselves guilty; and to the presumption of innocence. ..."" ""1. Private property rights ... are recognised. 2. ... 3. No-one may be deprived of his property and rights, except on justified grounds of public interest against proper compensation and in accordance with the provisions of the law."" 26. The jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court is defined as follows: ""The Constitutional Court has jurisdiction over the whole of Spanish territory and is competent to hear: (a) appeals against alleged unconstitutionality of laws and regulations having the force of law ...; (b) individual appeals for protection (recurso de amparo) against violation of the rights and liberties referred to in Article 53 para. 2 of the Constitution, in the circumstances and manner laid down by law; (c) conflicts of jurisdiction between the State and the Autonomous Communities or between the Autonomous Communities themselves. ..."" Only the rights guaranteed under Articles 14 to 29 of the Constitution may be the subject of an amparo appeal, which is not therefore available in respect of the right to property secured under Article 33. ""If a judicial body considers, in the course of proceedings, that a regulation with the status of law which is applicable in those proceedings and upon the validity of which the judgment depends may be contrary to the Constitution, it may bring the matter before the Constitutional Court in the circumstances, manner and subject to the consequences to be laid down by law; such consequences shall in no case be suspensive."" ""1. The judgments of the Constitutional Court shall be published in the Official State Gazette, together with any dissenting opinions.

Unless the judgment rules otherwise, that part of the law not affected by unconstitutionality shall remain in force."" 27. Chapter III of the Institutional Law on the Constitutional Court is entitled ""On questions of constitutionality submitted by judges and courts"" and is worded as follows: ""1. When a judge or court, ex proprio motu or at the request of a party, decides that a provision having the status of law which applies in the case in issue and on the validity of which his or its decision depends might be contrary to the Constitution, he or it shall refer the matter to the Constitutional Court, in accordance with the provisions of the present law. 2. Judges or courts shall not refer such a question until the case is ready to be tried and they must do so within the time-limits laid down for ruling on the case. They must specify which law or provision having the status of law is alleged to be unconstitutional and which article of the Constitution is considered to have been breached. They must also state the precise reasons why the outcome of the proceedings depends on the validity of the contested provision. Before taking a final decision on whether to refer the question to the Constitutional Court, the judge or court must first hear the views of the parties to the proceedings and the Attorney General’s department in order to give them the opportunity, within a single and non-extendable ten-day time-limit, to submit any observations they may wish to make concerning the pertinence of the question. The judge shall then announce his decision, without taking any further steps, within three days. No appeal shall lie against this decision. However, the question as to constitutionality may be raised again in subsequent proceedings until the judgment has become final."" ""A question as to constitutionality referred to the Constitutional Court by a judge or court must be accompanied by a certified copy of the main file and, in so far as there are any, the observations provided for in the preceding article."" ""1. On receipt of the file the Constitutional Court shall follow the procedure laid down in paragraph 2 of the present article. However, the Court may declare the question inadmissible, in a decision stating its reasons, after hearing only the Attorney General, when the procedural requirements are not satisfied or when the question is manifestly ill-founded. 2. The Constitutional Court shall give notice of the question to the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate via their respective Speakers, to the Attorney General and via the Ministry of Justice to the Government. If the question raises an issue concerning a law or another provision having the status of law adopted by an Autonomous Community, notice thereof shall also be given to its legislative and executive authorities. All these authorities may appear before the court and submit observations on the question referred within a single and non-extendable fifteen-day time-limit. When this time-limit has expired, the court shall give judgment within fifteen days, except when it considers a longer period, which may not exceed thirty days, to be necessary, in which case it must state the reasons for its decision.""",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1
160,001-79914,ENG,TUR,CHAMBER,2007,CASE OF ÖZTUNÇ v. TURKEY,4,Violation of Art. 6-1,Nicolas Bratza,"4. The applicant was born in 1936 and lives in Van. 5. In 1985 the applicant obtained a contract from the Provincial Administration of Van to carry out repair work in twelve public schools in Başkale in order to render them operational. 6. At a later date, however, he noticed that some of the schools had not yet been fully constructed. He applied to the Governor's Office in Van and requested the contract to be annulled. He submitted that the payment agreed on for the repairs was too low, given the amount of work needed to complete the construction of those schools. 7. The Governor's Office requested the applicant to start the construction and the repairs, reassuring him that he would be reimbursed for his additional work. 8. After having completed the construction, the applicant applied to the Provincial Administration of Van and requested additional compensation of 47,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL). However, his repeated efforts proved fruitless as no payment was made. 9. On 17 July 1989 he filed an action with the Van Civil Court and claimed the outstanding amount of TRL 47,273,000 plus interest. 10. On an unspecified date, the court appointed an expert to determine the amount of additional payment that the applicant was entitled to recover. However, the expert failed to submit his report. 11. In the absence of the expert report, the court ordered on-site visits to the schools in order to establish the additional work carried out by the applicant. 12. On 30 September 1999 the members of the court, accompanied by new experts, conducted an on-site examination at the schools. 13. On an unspecified date, the experts submitted their calculation of the sums incurred by the applicant for the additional work. 14. On 26 April 2000 the Van Civil Court awarded the applicant TRL 47,273,000 plus interest calculated at three different rates depending on the relevant period of time, i.e., 30% per annum running from 17 July 1989 to 1 January 1998; 50% per annum from 1 January 1998 to 1 January 2000; and at the rediscount rate running from 1 January 2000 until the date of payment. 15. The applicant appealed. In his petition to the Court of Cassation he complained about the loss that he had suffered as a result of the high rate of inflation during the proceedings before the civil court. 16. On 30 November 2000 the Court of Cassation upheld the decision of the civil court. On 9 April 2001 the same court dismissed the applicant's request for rectification. 17. On 23 July 2001 the applicant was paid the total amount of TRL 282,795,000, consisting of the capital plus interest incurred until the payment date.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Nice, France. Before 1999 the applicant was a resident of the village of Starye Atagi in Chechnya. He also submitted the complaint on behalf of his close relatives: his mother, Malika Zubayrayeva, brother Khasan (also spelled Khasin) and sisters Aset and Petimat Zubayrayeva, who are not applicants in the present case. 7. The facts of the case were partly disputed by the parties. Accordingly, the Court requested the Government to submit copies of the criminal investigation file. The submissions of the parties are summarised below in Part A. A summary of the documents submitted by the Government is set out in Part B below. 8. In October 1999 the applicant applied for asylum in Belgium. He said that he had served in the national security service of the self-proclaimed “Chechen Republic of Ichkeria”. 9. The applicant’s parents, brothers and sisters remained in Chechnya. His family lived in their house at 103 Nagornaya Street in the village of Starye Atagi. 10. The applicant’s mother, Malika Zubayrayeva, testified that in the early hours of 17 September 2000 the family had been woken by loud screams. A large group of men in camouflage uniforms and, in some instances, masks, whom she identified as belonging to the Russian special services (“spetsnaz”), entered the house and forced all the inhabitants outside. They were not allowed to get dressed and no reasons were given for their intervention. According to her, the intruders wore insignia of the Russian army and spoke Russian without an accent. 11. According to the applicant, the inhabitants of the house were lined up in the courtyard facing the wall and their passports were collected. The servicemen read out the names in the passports one by one. One of the applicant’s brothers, Magomed, was not at home that night and the men asked about his whereabouts. The applicant’s father Salaudi (also spelled Salavdi) Zubayrayev replied that he was not at home. The intruders hit the applicant’s other brother, Khasan Zubayrayev (born in 1977), with a rifle butt on the head and led the applicant’s father away. They then forced the women into one of the rooms. In the meantime others opened all the rooms in the house and searched them. They collected valuables and family photographs. 12. Once the armed men had left, the women went outside and found Khasan in the courtyard. The body of the applicant’s father was found about 100- 200 metres from the house. He had been shot in the back of the head with an automatic rifle. 13. On the same night and in similar circumstances four other persons were killed in Starye Atagi: Musa Abubakarov (aged about 70), Zaur Demilkhanov (who was born in 1982), Vakha Elmurzayev (aged about 70) and Isa Elmurzayev (aged about 30). 14. The applicant submitted that on 18 September 2000 the Russian television news had announced that several persons, including the applicant’s father, had been killed the previous night in Starye Atagi by religious extremists – the “wahhabists”. 15. The Government submitted that in the early hours of 17 September 2000 a group of unidentified persons armed with automatic weapons had entered the village of Starye Atagi and murdered five men, all of whom had been shot with automatic weapons. The Government stressed that all the persons killed had been loyal to the federal authorities, and openly expressed their negative opinion of “wahhabists.” The Government also stressed that one of the persons killed was the son of a police officer from the Ministry of the Interior. They submitted that there was no reason to suspect that the killings had been committed by State agents. 16. The applicant submitted that on 17 September 2000 the family had been preparing for Salaudi Zubayrayev’s funeral when they learnt that there were investigators present at the crime scene. The applicant’s younger brother Khasan had gone to see them. He had taken along cartridges he had found near his father’s body – nine from a Kalashnikov 5,45 millimetre automatic rifle and three from a 9 mm Makarov pistol. 17. At the place where his father’s body had been found the applicant’s brother saw a group of servicemen surrounded by villagers. He inquired who was the most senior and gave him the cartridges. The officers stated that they had come from the Grozny District Prosecutor’s Office. The applicant’s brother had tried to explain that he was the son of the person killed and a witness of the crime, and that other members of the family were at home preparing the body for burial. As the officers did not seem to be interested in his statements, he had tried to obtain their names and ranks. In response one of the officers had rudely asked if he also wanted to know his home address in Russia. The officers had shouted at him and the other villagers, and had ordered them to disperse and made threats. They had not visited their house. None of the family members were questioned that day or later about the circumstances of the murders, nor had anyone come to their house to take pictures of the body or to collect other relevant evidence. 18. The applicant said that his father had been buried on 17 September 2000 at the village cemetery. The family members had not contacted a doctor or taken pictures of the body before the burial. Nor had they contacted any representatives of the military or investigative bodies, as they considered this to be a waste of time in view of the prosecutors’ attitude. They were never contacted by the authorities in relation to the murder. 19. The Government submitted that on 17 September 2000, immediately following the receipt of news of the murders in Starye Atagi, a group of investigators had arrived in the village and taken immediate action. They had submitted copies of documents that had been drawn up by the investigators on 17 September 2000, including descriptions of the scenes of the murders and of the bodies, including that of Salaudi Zubayrayev. The team had also collected cartridges and bullets (see paragraphs 44 and 45 below). The Government denied that the investigators had ever mistreated the relatives of the victims and noted that the case file contained no complaints from the victims or anyone else of reprehensible conduct on the part of the officers of the law-enforcement bodies. 20. On 17 September 2000 the Grozny District Prosecutor’s Office opened a criminal investigation into the murders of five men in Starye Atagi under Article 105 § 2 of the Criminal Code (the provision applicable to multiple murders). The investigation was assigned case file no. 18040. 21. On the same day the acting Grozny District prosecutor informed the prosecutor of Chechnya about the events and the action that had been taken by his office in the aftermath of the murders. His note referred to the information collected in Starye Atagi, including the examination of the scenes of the crime and of the bodies and to the cartridges and bullets that had been collected. It concluded by saying, on the basis of the statements of the local residents, that the crime had probably been committed by illegal armed groups . 22. On 17 October 2000 the Grozny District Civil Registration Office issued a death certificate for Salavdi Dzhamilovich Zubayrayev, who had been born in 1935. Death was recorded as having occurred on 17 September 2000 in Starye Atagi. 23. At the end of September 2000 the applicant wrote to the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, complaining of the murder of his father and other persons in Starye Atagi and of the absence of an investigation. In a reply dated 5 December 2000 the Commissioner for Human Rights expressed his sympathy and promised to raise the issue with the Special Envoy of the Russian President in Chechnya for Rights and Freedoms, Mr Kalamanov, at a meeting which was due to take place the same day. 24. On 17 November 2000 the investigation was adjourned because the killers could not be identified. It does not appear that anyone was granted victim status in the proceedings at that time or that information about the adjournment was communicated to the victims’ relatives. 25. On 5 April 2001 the investigation was resumed. The Chechnya Prosecutor’s Office ordered a number of steps to be taken, in particular eye-witnesses and other witnesses were to be questioned, victim status was to be granted to the relatives of those killed, information concerning the personalities of the deceased was to be collected and forensic and ballistic tests were to be carried out. 26. On 19 May 2001 the investigation was adjourned. It does not appear that any investigative activity took place between November 2001 and October 2004. 27. In September 2004 the present application was communicated to the Russian Government. 28. On 16 October 2004 the investigation was resumed pursuant to an order of the Grozny District Prosecutor. The order contained criticism of the investigation that had been carried out up to that point and referred to a number of basic investigative steps that needed to be taken (see paragraph 49 below). 29. In October 2004 the relatives of the five men who had been killed in Starye Atagi on 17 September 2000 were questioned and granted victim status. According to the Government, they stated that their relatives had been killed in the early hours of 17 September 2000 by unknown armed men wearing masks. They did not have any suspicions as to the identity of the killers. The Government referred to their statements, but did not submit any copies. They also referred to undated statements of other residents of Starye Atagi, who likewise did not possess any information about the identity of the killers. 30. The Government further submitted that in November 2004 a certain Rustam Z. had been charged with participating in an illegal armed group and involvement in the murder of Mr Demilkhanov on the night of 17 September 2000. Later Rustam Z. retracted his statements in this regard, alleging that they had been made under duress. In March 2005 the charges relating in part to his involvement in the murders on 17 September 2000 were dropped. The investigation of the charges against Rustam Z. was at some point joined with the investigation of the five murders, but after the charges against him were dropped, the cases were separated (see paragraphs 51-54 below). 31. The Government added that the investigation into the murders committed in Starye Atagi on 17 September 2000 had been adjourned and reopened on four occasions. 32. In their observations, the Government also stated that the relatives of Salaudi Zubayrayev had not been interviewed or been granted victim status in the proceedings in view of their departure from Russia. In October 2004 the investigation questioned and granted victim status to Mrs. E., Salaudin Zubayrayev’s daughter-in-law. She stated that she had been in Grozny at the relevant time but had no additional information about the circumstances of the crime. 33. The Government added that the investigation had failed to establish the identity of the culprits and no one had been charged with the crime. However, the implication of servicemen or representatives of other State authorities had not been established. The investigation had focused on the main theory that the murders had been committed by members of illegal armed groups in order to intimidate the civilian population and to destabilise the district, especially as one of the persons killed was the son of a police officer from the Ministry of the Interior. 34. Following the Court’s decision on admissibility in September 2006 and a request to produce documents from the investigation file, the Government submitted about 50 pages of documents from the case file, which contained over 300 pages. The documents are summarised below in Part B, and, in addition to the initial documents drawn up on 17 September 2000, contained the prosecutor’s decisions to adjourn and reopen the investigation and papers relating to the charges against Rustam Z. Relying on the information obtained from the Prosecutor General’s Office, the Government observed that the investigation was in progress and that disclosure of the documents would violate Article 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, since the file contained information of a military nature and personal data concerning the witnesses. However, they agreed to produce several documents whose “disclosure did not contravene the requirements of Article 161”. 35. The applicant’s relatives stated that on 10 December 2000 three armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and one Ural truck with soldiers had arrived at their family home. The applicant’s two brothers, Magomed and Khasan, had run away through the backyard when they heard the vehicles approaching. The applicant’s mother had remained in the house with her daughters and daughters-in-law. 36. According to the applicant’s mother, servicemen wearing masks had entered the house, asked the women about the whereabouts of the men, and then asked if anyone had complained “to Europe”. They had also asked them about electronic equipment found in the house and whether they had any weapons or money. The applicant also alleged that the military had taken a number of valuables from the house. The neighbours had later told the Zubayrayev family that the hull and registration numbers of the APCs and the Ural truck were covered with mud and that they had not been allowed to get sufficiently close to note them down. 37. The raid on the Zubayrayevs’ house on 10 December 2000 had been reported by NGO Memorial in their monthly monitor of human-rights violations in Chechnya. In February 2001 the applicant had again written to the Council of Europe Human Rights Commissioner, to inform him that pressure was being exerted on his family. 38. Early in the morning of 14 January 2001 the applicant’s family’s house had again been searched by servicemen. After that the applicant’s remaining family had left the house, as they feared for their lives and security and did not trust the Russian authorities any more. 39. The applicant presented his mother’s written account of these events, countersigned by her and her other children who had been living with her at that time. 40. In February 2001 Obyedinennaya Gazeta published an open letter from the residents of Starye Atagi to Mr Aslakhanov, a member of the State Duma. The letter, which was signed by the head of the village council and 150 villagers, complained of several “mopping-up” operations in the village in 2000 – 2001, including on 14 January 2000, when the Zubayrayev family home was raided. The letter further listed 57 inhabitants of the village who had lost their lives since October 1999, among them the applicant’s father and four other men, who had been killed on the night of 17 September 2000 by unknown persons wearing camouflage uniforms and masks and speaking Russian. 41. In March 2001 the applicants’ remaining family left Russia and sought asylum abroad. 42. The Government denied that there was any information to suggest that the members of the applicant’s family had been ill-treated or that their homes had been searched or their possessions confiscated. 43. In December 2006 the Government informed the Court of the progress of the investigation and produced several documents from the case file. Altogether, they produced 34 documents running to 52 pages from the file, which, as can be ascertained from the page numbering, comprised over 300 pages. Below is a summary of the documents concerned. 44. On 17 September 2000 the investigative group of the Grozny District Prosecutor’s Office compiled a report on the scene of the crime. The five-page handwritten document contained a description of each individual site where the killings had been carried out, a brief description of the bodies of the victims and a list of the cartridges and bullets that had been collected at the sites, some of which bore production numbers. In relation to the applicant’s father the report read: “the body of Salaudi Zubayrayev was examined in his house. The body bears two gunshot wounds to the dorsum and two to the head: one to the back of the head and one to the right temple area.” 45. On 17 September 2000 the Grozny District acting prosecutor drew up the following account of the events for the Chechnya Prosecutor: “At 9.30 a.m. on 17 September 2000 the Grozny District Prosecutor’s Office was informed by the Grozny Temporary District Department of the Interior (VOVD) of the murder of five inhabitants of Starye Atagi. Following this message, at 10 a.m. a group of [investigators of the district prosecutor’s office and the VOVD] set out to the scene of the crime. There, a number of operative and immediate investigative steps were taken, as a result of which it was possible to establish the following. On the night of 16 to 17 September 2000, at about 2 a.m., a group of persons using a number of vehicles (probably including a grey Volga car without number plates) had burst into the village. The group was composed of about 14-18 persons wearing new camouflage uniforms of a green-yellow colour and armed with automatic weapons, hand-pistols and knives. Between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. the group murdered five inhabitants of the village; one person was wounded and a Volga car was damaged by gunfire. Abubakarov Musa, who was born in 1928 in Starye Atagi and was of Chechen ethnic origin and disabled, was taken out of his house at 15 Pochtovaya Street and shot dead in the street, about 200 metres from his home. The body bears gunshot wounds to the head (4) and back (1) and a knife wound to the chest. Demilkhanov Zaur Gikhaniyevich, who was born on 28.04.1981 in Grozny and was of Chechen ethnic origin and unemployed, was killed in his house at 155 Nagornaya Street, in the presence of his parents. The body bears gunshot wounds to the head (2), back and legs (2). Elmurzayev Vakha Elmurzayevich, who was born on 21.03.1934 in the village of Zony and was of Chechen ethnic origin and unemployed, was taken out of his house at 150 Nagornaya Street by the assailants and killed in the courtyard of the house at 156 Nagornaya Street. The body bears injuries from blunt instruments to the head, gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen (6). Elmurzayev Isa Vakhovich (son of Vakha Elmurzayev), who was born on 15.03.1967 in Starye Atagi and was of Chechen ethnic origin and disabled, was killed in his house at 150 Nagornaya Street. The body bears gunshot wounds to the neck (1) and chest (4). Zubayrayev Salavdi Khamilyevich, who was born in 1935 in Starye Atagi and was of Chechen ethnic origin, lived in his house at 105 Nagornaya Street. He was taken out of his house by the assailants and killed in Podgornaya Street, about 100 metres away. The body bears gunshot wounds to the back (3) and head (2). The same armed persons also attacked Moldy [M.], who was at his home at 50 Sheripova Street. He received gunshot wounds to both legs and the abdomen. However, he managed to escape from his assailants and his neighbours immediately took him to hospital in a Volga car, where he received first aid. While [M.] was being driven to the hospital, the vehicle [he was travelling in] was shot at and damaged. After the assault the criminals left Starye Atagi in an unknown direction. As the statements of the witnesses show, the criminals used automatic weapons (AK, AKM), hand pistols (PM) and knives. The firearms were equipped with silencers. Attempts from fellow villagers to intervene were cut off by threats and shots fired in the air. Between themselves the criminals spoke Russian, some with a Chechen accent. They did not make any demands of the victims or take any property. They acted in a coordinated way, according to a plan, with remarkable audacity and cynicism. The murders were committed in the presence of relatives and fellow villagers. The victims had no family, personal or business connections with or dependencies on each other. They did not participate in political or public life. There is no information concerning their possible involvement with illegal armed groups. During the on-site inspection each of the places where the victims were killed was examined, as were the sites where [Mr M.] was attacked and the Volga car shot at. The investigators took a large number of photographs of the relevant spots and traces of blood and collected a number of cartridges and bullets (5,45 millimetre, 7,62 millimetre – that is to say AKS-74U and AKM accordingly, 9 millimetre – PM). On 17 September 2000 the Grozny District Prosecutor’s Office opened criminal investigation file no. 18040 under Article 105 part 2 (a) of the Criminal Code. ... The main theory of the investigators is that the crime was committed by members of illegal armed groups in order to scare the local population and to destabilize the situation in Grozny District, in order to provoke a conflict between the population and the acting federal authorities. The investigators are also looking at other possible explanations. It should further be noted that the crime has been widely reported and prompted an outcry by a large section of the public. It has given rise to antagonism on the part of the population of Starye Atagi towards the law-enforcement authorities and allowed them to disparage the work of the law-enforcement bodies and the federal authorities in general. The villagers are certain that the crimes were committed by members of illegal armed groups. The investigative team who came to Starye Atagi on 17 September 2000 were criticised by the local residents who said that the federal authorities and law-enforcement bodies were unable to protect them against criminal attacks by illegal armed groups; as an example of this they referred to the events of 17 September 2000.” 46. On 17 November 2000 the investigation was adjourned because the identity of the killers could not be established. 47. On 5 April 2001 the investigation was resumed. The Chechnya Prosecutor’s Office ordered a number of steps to be taken, in particular that eye-witnesses and other witnesses be questioned, victim status be granted to the victims’ relatives, information concerning the personalities of the deceased be collected, and forensic and ballistic expert reports carried out. 48. On 19 May 2001 the investigation was adjourned. It does not appear that this information was conveyed to anyone outside the Grozny District Prosecutor’s Office. 49. On 16 October 2004 the investigation was resumed pursuant to an order of the Grozny District Prosecutor. The order noted that one Moldy M., who had been wounded on 17 September 2000, had not been questioned. The district prosecutor stated that he should be questioned and granted victim status in the proceedings and that a medical expert report should be ordered. Furthermore, the investigating authorities were to collect statements from relatives of the five men who had been killed and to accord them victim status. They were also to question neighbours, police officers and local public officials about the personalities of the victims and the circumstances of the crime. They were instructed to make an official inventory of the real evidence pertaining to the case, notably the bullets and cartridges, and to obtain the results of a ballistic expert’s report, which had apparently been commissioned in October 2000. 50. In November 2004 the Grozny District Prosecutor extended the term of the investigation for one month. He noted that a number of procedural steps had been carried out in the meantime, in particular, Mr M. had been questioned and, he and the relatives of the five persons killed had been granted victim status in the proceedings. Witness statements had been collected from villagers, police officers and local officials in Starye Atagi. A number of expert reports had been commissioned and in some cases the results had already been obtained. However, a number of other investigative actions were still pending and therefore the term of the investigation was extended. 51. On 2 November 2004 a certain Rustam Z. was arrested and charged with participation in an illegal armed group (Article 209 part 2 of the Criminal Code) and murder committed by a group (Article 105 part 2 (j)). 52. On 18 November 2004 the acting deputy to the Chechnya Prosecutor ordered the joinder of the proceedings in criminal investigation file no. 51979 against Rustam Z. and criminal investigation file no. 18040 concerning the murder of five persons in Starye Atagi on 17 September 2000. The decision referred to a statement of 1 November 2004 in which Mr Z. had admitted his involvement in the murders. He stated that since 2002 he had been a member of an illegal armed group, at that time headed by “Emir Mussa Salayev”. In 2000, before becoming a full member of the gang, he had been asked by one of its members to assist in “settling the scores” with the Starye Atagi local police inspector [Mr Demilkhanov]. It was thus established that the investigation concerned the same set of events and the proceedings were joined to case no. 51979. 53. Rustam Z. was questioned again on 11 November 2004 and stated that in the evening of 16 September 2000 he had been asked to keep watch outside the house of the police officer. He had heard shots fired inside the house. After about 30 minutes he saw that other members of the gang had brought an older man to the house and heard further shots being fired. The gang members later told him that they had not found the police inspector at home and had killed his son [Zaur Demilkahnov] in his bed because they had mistaken him for his father. He had later learnt that the gang members had killed several other persons in the village that night. 54. On a later date Mr Z. stated that he had made his statement under duress from the police officers who had arrested him and that he had not taken part in the killing of Zaur Demilkhanov. His relatives testified that Rustam R. had been in Ingushetia from 1999 to 2002, together with the rest of the family. He had not been in Chechnya even for short periods prior to 2002. On 15 March 2005 the murder charges were withdrawn. As a result, on 23 April 2005 the two criminal cases were again severed and the five murders of 17 September 2000 were reassigned to case file no. 18040. In April 2005 Mr Z. was charged with participation in an illegal armed group, armed robbery, the illegal handling of arms and explosives and stealing identity documents. 55. On 1 May 2005 investigation no. 18040 was adjourned. The victims were informed of that decision and of the possibility of an appeal. 56. On 14 November 2006 the investigation was resumed, before being further adjourned on 14 December 2006 and reopened on 20 December 2006. The victims were informed.","['13', '2', '38']",['2-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Moscow. 6. At the material time the applicant held the position of Head of the Department of Justice of the Sakhalin Region (начальник Управления юстиции Сахалинской области). 7. On an unspecified date an external audit commenced in the said Department and embezzlement of budgetary assets was subsequently established. 8. On 25 February 2000 criminal proceedings were instituted in this connection. 9. On 28 February 2000 at 8 a.m. the applicant retained a lawyer. 10. On 28 February 2000 at 8:30 a.m. the applicant was arrested and placed in custody. Being questioned as a suspect in the case, the applicant availed herself of the right to remain silent and applied for release on bail or subject to personal surety. 11. On 29 February 2000 the investigator in charge refused to release the applicant, stating that, according to Article 101 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, “a measure of restraint could only be changed in the circumstances when it was no longer needed” and that “there were no such circumstances” in the applicant's case. 12. On the same date the applicant resigned from her position. 13. On 1 March 2000 the investigator in charge remanded the applicant in custody. The order, which was approved by a deputy prosecutor of the Sakhalin Region, referred to the danger of the applicant's absconding, the risk of her obstructing the establishment of the truth and influencing the witnesses who had been her subordinates, and to the gravity of the charges against her. 14. The applicant's request to release her subject to the imposition of another measure of restraint was examined and refused by the investigator on 2 March 2000. 15. On 6 March 2000 the applicant's lawyer appealed to the court against the applicant's pre-trial detention. 16. The application was examined by judge A. of the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Town Court (“the Town Court”) on 10 March 2000. At the hearing the applicant and her counsel reiterated their request for the applicant's release in view of her poor health, the fact that she had family commitments and a good reference from her former place of work. The judge confirmed the lawfulness of the applicant's remand in custody, having based this decision on “the evidence in the applicant's case file, proving that she might abscond or influence the witnesses if released”. 17. According to the applicant, the evidence referred to by Judge A. was a transcript of an audio tape recording of telephone conversations of another suspect, K. During one such conversation K. stated that “on Monday Nina Ivanovna will leave forever”. 18. On 12 April 2000 the Sakhalin Regional Court (“the Regional Court”) upheld the decision of 10 March 2000 on appeal. 19. Meanwhile, on 7 March 2000, formal charges of embezzlement and abuse of power had been brought against the applicant. Since the applicant's counsel was unable to attend the police station that day, the investigating authorities appointed another lawyer to assist her. However, in the absence of her counsel, the applicant refused to read and sign the decision to charge her. 20. On 15 March 2000 the applicant's lawyer challenged the decision of 7 March 2000 before the court, claiming that the applicant's right to defence had been violated. He also requested the court to release the applicant pending trial. 21. On 4 April 2000 judge A. of the Town Court disallowed the above complaint, having noted that the allegations advanced by the applicant's representative had already been examined and rejected by the courts during the first judicial review of the applicant's detention. 22. On 3 May 2000 the Regional Court set aside the above decision and discontinued the proceedings in respect of the complaint of 15 March 2000. The court noted, inter alia, that the applicant was entitled to appeal against the alleged infringement of her right to defence at the trial stage. 23. On 19 April 2000 the regional prosecutor extended the applicant's detention until 25 June 2000 on the ground that she might flee the trial or put pressure on witnesses while at liberty. 24. On 17 May 2000 the applicant challenged this order before the court, and requested to be released. She maintained, in particular, that she could not hinder the investigation or influence the witnesses, since the audit had terminated on 13 April 2000. The applicant also referred to poor conditions of her detention and deterioration of her health. 25. On 25 May 2000 judge A. of the Town Court dismissed the applicant's complaint as unfounded, with reference to the gravity of the charges, “the applicant's personality” and “the evidence in the applicant's case file, proving that she might abscond or influence the witnesses if released”. The judge also noted that the investigating authorities had produced a medical report stating that the applicant had no need of medical treatment. 26. In her appeal against the decision of 25 May 2000 the applicant stated, inter alia, that Judge A. should have been disqualified from reviewing her detention, as this judge had already considered and rejected her applications for release on two previous occasions. 27. On 25 June 2000 the Regional Court upheld the decision of 25 May 2000. With respect to the applicant's argument concerning Judge A., the court noted that the domestic law entitled a judge to examine a repeated complaint about the lawfulness of detention. 28. On 30 May 2000 a deputy prosecutor of the Sakhalin Region refused the applicant's request for release. 29. On 2 June 2000 the applicant was charged with a number of additional counts relating to embezzlement, abuse of power and forgery. 30. On 13 June 2000 the preliminary investigation was terminated and the applicant and her lawyer began studying the case file. 31. On 21 June 2000 the regional prosecutor ordered the extension of the applicant's detention until 10 August 2000. 32. The applicant appealed against the prosecutor's decision, claiming that she was unable to obstruct the establishment of the truth or influence the witnesses, since the investigation had already terminated. She also referred to her poor state of health. 33. On 24 July 2000 judge B. of the Town Court dismissed the applicant's complaint, holding that her detention was “in accordance with law” and necessary in view of the seriousness of the charges and the applicant's personality. The judge also took note of medical certificates produced by the applicant's lawyer as well as the aforementioned medical report adduced by the investigating body, and found the applicant's allegations that she was in poor health unsubstantiated. 34. On 13 September 2000 the Regional Court upheld the above decision on appeal. The court noted that the applicant was charged with a serious criminal offence and its severity alone could, according to Article 96-2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, permit her continued detention. 35. On 8 August 2000 the applicant's counsel lodged a complaint against the investigator in charge, requesting the court to order the applicant's inpatient examination by an independent medical authority. 36. On 15 August 2000 Judge B. of the Town Court declined jurisdiction to examine the complaint, stating that it fell within the competence of the prosecutor. This decision was upheld on appeal by the Regional Court on 25 October 2000. 37. In the meantime, on 7 August 2000, the regional prosecutor extended the period of the applicant's remand in custody until 25 August 2000. 38. On 15 August 2000 the applicant appealed to the court against the prosecutor's order. Her complaint was assigned to Judge A. of the Town Court. 39. The applicant sought the withdrawal of the judge. On 18 August 2000 Judge A. dismissed the challenge. 40. At the hearing on 21 August 2000 the applicant and her defence counsel claimed that the preliminary investigation had been completed, that the applicant had finished studying her case file, and that therefore the investigating authorities had no reasons to believe that the applicant might flee or obstruct the establishment of the truth if at large. Moreover, the applicant posed no danger to the public and suffered from various health problems, which required proper medical treatment. 41. Having heard the parties, Judge A. found that the applicant should remain in custody, on account of the gravity of the charges and the risk of her absconding. The judge further rejected the applicant's complaints about her health as groundless. This decision was upheld on appeal by the Regional Court on 13 September 2000. 42. On 23 August 2000 the investigator refused to release the applicant, making a general reference to the absence of any circumstances proving that her detention was no longer needed. 43. On 25 August 2000 the applicant's case was forwarded to the Town Court for examination. 44. On 4 September 2000 Judge K. of the Town Court remitted the case for a further investigation and stated that the applicant should remain in custody in view of the seriousness of the charges. 45. The applicant appealed against the above decision in so far as it concerned her detention. 46. On 25 October 2000 the Regional Court dismissed the appeal. 47. Meanwhile, on 22 August 2000 the deputy Prosecutor General had authorised the applicant's detention until 25 October 2000. This order was served on the applicant on 15 September 2000. 48. On 17 September 2000 the applicant challenged the extension of her custody period before the Town Court, complaining, in particular, that she had not been notified of the order of 22 August 2000 in time. 49. At the hearing on 25 September 2000 the applicant also referred to the poor state of her health and the absence of any risk that she might abscond or hinder the investigation, which was at an end. Her arguments were examined and rejected as unfounded. Having acknowledged the fact that the order of 22 August 2000 had not been served on the applicant in due time, the court held that this fact did not affect the legal force of the extension order or the lawfulness of the applicant's detention. It therefore ordered the applicant's continued detention, with reference to the gravity of the charges against her. On 25 October 2000 the Regional Court upheld the first-instance decision. 50. On 16 October 2000 the applicant requested the investigator to release her. 51. On 17 October 2000 the investigator informed the applicant that there were no reasons to release her. 52. On 20 October 2000 the case was again transferred to the Town Court for examination on the merits. 53. On 4 November 2000 Judge K. of the Town Court scheduled a hearing in the applicant's case and held that “in view of the gravity of the charges [against the applicant] the measure of restraint applied to her should remain unchanged”. The decision did not specify the time-limit for the applicant's detention, nor did it refer to any other matters regarding the lawfulness of her detention. 54. On 17 November 2000 the applicant appealed against the above decision in so far as it related to her detention. She claimed that between 25 October 2000, when the period of her remand in custody had expired, and 4 November 2000 her detention had had no basis in domestic law. She further complained that the court had ignored her submissions about the state of her health. 55. On 13 December 2000 the Regional Court dismissed the applicant's appeal, finding that her detention was lawful. The court stated that the applicant had been charged with serious crimes, and could be detained on the sole ground of the dangerousness of those offences. With regard to the applicant's argument concerning her detention between 25 October 2000 and 4 November 2000, the court noted that the applicant's case file, including the indictment, had been transmitted to court on 20 October 2000, before the period of her remand in custody had expired. Accordingly, in the court's opinion, the statutory provisions governing the time-limit for detention during the preliminary investigation had been complied with in respect of the applicant. The court further stated that, upon referral of the case to court, the first instance had taken its decision in due time, as prescribed by Article 223-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 56. The applicant's further requests for release were rejected by the Town Court on 22 and 29 December 2000 and 9 January 2001 with a reference to the absence of any “new grounds for altering [the applicant's] measure of restraint”. 57. On 6 February 2001 the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Town Court, composed of Judge K. and two lay assessors, convicted the applicant, along with another co-accused, of embezzlement, forgery and abuse of power, and sentenced her to six years and six months' imprisonment and confiscation of her property. 58. On 23 May 2001 the Sakhalin Regional Court upheld the sentence, having lifted the charges against the applicant on three counts with reference to a limitation period. 59. Thereafter the applicant applied unsuccessfully for a supervisory review. 60. On 30 September 2002 the applicant was released on parole. 61. According to the applicant, from 28 February until 29 March 2000 she was kept in the temporary holding facility of the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Department of the Interior (изолятор временного содержания управления внутренних дел г. Южно-Сахалинска, “the IVS”). In support of that submission, the applicant enclosed the authorities' letters dated 10 and 22 March 2000 respectively sent to her at the address of the IVS. 62. The applicant corroborated her account below with a written statement from one her former inmates. 63. The IVS was situated in the basement of the premises of the Department of the Interior. Following her arrest the applicant was placed in a cell measuring approximately 3 x 2.5 metres which was 2.5 metres high. There were no windows in the cell, with the result that there was no natural light, nor any fresh air. The inside temperature did not exceed 12oC. There was an iron sink and a cold-water tap, but the water pressure was very low. There was no toilet bowl or any other installation in the cell, and the applicant had to use the sink for her needs. The cell was overrun with mice, rats, lice, cockroaches and fungus. 64. The applicant was not allowed to take any toiletries or a change of clothes with her. She was not provided with any bedding and had to sleep on a plain wooden plank bed. During the first two days of her detention the applicant was not given any food or drinking water. 65. On 29 February 2000, in the evening, the applicant was transferred to another cell which accommodated four other inmates. The conditions in that cell were similar to those described above. It had no windows and was lit by a single 40-watt bulb. All the inmates except the applicant were smokers but the cell was ventilated only once a week when the detainees were taken to shower. 66. There was a big aluminium tank with a capacity of 80-100 litres in the cell. The tank, which had no cover, was used by the cellmates as a toilet. They stretched a piece of cloth over the top to try to reduce the smell. Every evening the cellmates took the tank out of the cell to the common toilet and washed it in turn using a hose with cold water. The tank was never disinfected. 67. The applicant was not provided with any bedding until a fortnight later, when she received it from her family, and slept on a wooden plank bed. The detainees were taken to shower no more than once a week; they were not given soap or any other toiletries or a change of clean underwear. During the entire period of her detention in the IVS the applicant did not have even one opportunity for exercise, due to the absence of the necessary facilities. 68. The applicant was allowed to receive food from her relatives, but, in her submission, she was hardly able to eat given that she had gastrointestinal problems and because of the poor sanitary conditions in the cell. The applicant, who suffered from heart, gastrointestinal and gynaecological conditions, was prohibited from receiving any medicines which she had been taking prior to her detention from her family with the result that her state of health deteriorated. Between 23 and 26 March 2000, following the applicant's complaints about aggravation of osteochondrosis, the IVS authorities called an ambulance and the applicant was given pain-relieving injections. 69. On 7 March 2000 the applicant's representative applied to the regional prosecutor's office, requesting the applicant's transfer into a separate cell. 70. In a letter of 13 March 2000 the regional prosecutor instructed the head of the Regional Department of the Interior to grant this request. 71. In their additional observations of 7 September 2007 the Government stated that throughout the entire period of her detention the applicant was held in remand centre IZ-62/1. They therefore provided no information relating to the applicant's alleged detention in the IVS. 72. The exact period during which the applicant was held in remand centre IZ-62/1 (subsequently IZ-65/1) in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk (СИЗО- 62/1 – “the IZ-62/1”) and the conditions of her detention there are disputed by the parties. 73. According to the applicant, on 29 March 2000 she was transferred to the IZ-62/1, in which she remained until 30 September 2002. The applicant corroborated her account of the conditions in the remand centre with written statements by two of her former cellmates, dated 28 February 2001 and 7 December 2007. 74. In their observations of 15 December 2004 the Government indicated that the applicant was detained in the IZ-62/1 from 29 March 2000 until 29 September 2002. In their additional observations of 7 September 2007 the Government submitted that in the periods from 28 February until 29 March 2000 and from 29 March 2000 until 30 September 2002 the applicant was held in the IZ-62/1. 75. In their original observations, the Government based the account concerning the applicant's conditions of detention on a number of certificates issued by the head of the IZ-62/1 on 3 November 2004. In their additional observations, in reply to the Court's request that the description of the conditions of the applicant's detention be corroborated with documentary evidence pertaining to the period when she had been detained in the IZ-62/1, the Government submitted a number of certificates issued by the head of the remand centre on 21 August 2007, written explanations given on 17 August 2007 by several warders who had served in the IZ-62/1 at the relevant time, a copy of the applicant's medical file, and photographs of the cells which had accommodated the applicant. The certificates either describe the present-day conditions in the cells in which the applicant was kept or report on various aspects of the applicant's detention at the relevant period. The warders' written statements concern the conditions of the applicant's detention at the relevant period. The medical file is the only document issued during the applicant's detention. It reflects the applicant's medical history in the IZ-62/1. 76. According to the applicant, between 29 March and early May 2000 she was held in cell no. 53, then she was transferred to cell no. 47 in which she spent three months, in early August 2000 she was placed in cell no. 020 where she remained until the middle of October 2000, then she spent a month and a half in cell no. 49, and from later November 2000 until 30 September 2002 she was kept in cell no. 54. The Government disputed this submission. One of the certificates of 21 August 2007 submitted by them states that from 29 March until 29 May 2000 the applicant was held in cell no. 49, from 29 May until 29 June 2000 she was kept in cell no. 020, and from this latter date until 30 September 2002 she was kept in cell no. 54. 77. In the applicant's submission, cell no. 53 measured approximately 24 square metres and was 3 metres high. It was designed for ten detainees. The applicant shared this cell with five inmates. Cell no. 47 also measured approximately 24 square metres and was designed for ten detainees. It held nine inmates. The applicant shared cell no. 020 measuring about 8 square metres and designed for four detainees with another cellmate. Cell no. 49 measured 20 square metres and was designed for ten inmates. It accommodated the applicant and one more detainee. The applicant shared cell no. 54 measuring 14 square metres with another detainee. 78. According to the Government, cell no. 49 measures between 24.6 square metres, as indicated in a certificate of 3 November 2004, and 26 square metres, as indicated in a certificate of 21 August 2007. The cell is intended for seven detainees, whereas the applicant shared this cell with five cellmates. Cell no. 020 measures 8 square metres and is designed for two detainees. In the Government's submission, the applicant was held there alone. Cell no. 54 measures between 14 square metres, according to a certificate of 3 November 2004, and 15.1 square metres, as stated in a certificate of 21 August 2007. The applicant shared this cell, which could accommodate up to four detainees, with another cellmate. 79. According to the applicant, in each cell where she was kept there was a single window. In cell no. 53 the window measuring approximately 1 x 1.4 metres was partly covered with glass and partly with plywood and always remained shut, therefore there was no natural ventilation. In cells nos. 47, 020 and 49 the windows were not glazed, whereas in cell no. 54 the window, also measuring 1 x 1.4 metres, was only partly glazed. The applicant submitted in respect of her detention in cell no. 49 that the prison authorities had repeatedly refused to accept glass for the window from her husband and had not glazed the window before the middle of November 2000 following numerous complaints by the applicant to the regional prosecutor's office. In the applicant's submission, the windows in each cell were covered with metal grilles supplemented with “eyelashes”, which are metal strips covering the grille. From the outside the windows were covered with wooden shields, and therefore only refracted daylight could reach inside. Each cell was only illuminated with a single 60-watt bulb. 80. The Government submitted that during the entire period of the applicant's detention the windows in all the cells had been glazed and had never been covered with plywood. The size of the windows – 1.4 x 1 metres in cells nos. 49 and 54, and 0.8 x 0.8 metres in cell no. 020 – was sufficient to let in enough daylight to enable detainees to read. Each window had a vent which ensured proper natural ventilation of the cells. According to the Government, the shutters had been removed from the windows in the period from January to March 2003. As regards artificial light, the Government submitted that each cell was illuminated with a bulb of 75- up to100-watt in the day and with a 25-watt bulb in the night. 81. According to the applicant, she was the only non-smoker in the cells where all the other detainees smoked. There was no mechanical ventilation in any of the cells. The cells were damp, with concrete floors. In the winter the temperature in the cells did not exceed 12oC whilst in the summer it was stiflingly hot inside and the temperature reached 24-26oC. In the Government's submission, each cell was equipped with mechanical ventilation and the average temperature was maintained at the level of 2022oC with a humidity level of 55.3 per cent. They relied on a report reflecting the results of measurement on 17 August 2007 of temperature and humidity level in cells nos. 49, 020 and 54 of the IZ-65/1. The report was drawn up by a regional authority for hygiene and epidemiology and indicated that the temperature in the cells ranged between 23.5 and 23.9oC with the humidity level ranging between 54.4 and 58.4 per cent. The Government accepted that at least for some time the applicant had had to share a cell with smokers, but insisted that she had not endured severe suffering in this connection, given that a cell had been 3 metres high and had had natural and mechanical ventilation. They also submitted that on 29 May 2000, at the applicant's request, she had been transferred to cell no. 020, where she was held alone, and a month later she was transferred to cell no. 54, which she shared with a non-smoker. 82. It was not in dispute between the parties that each cell was equipped with a sink and a lavatory pan, that cold running water was available around the clock and that the detainees were also regularly provided with drinking water. The Government also submitted that detainees were provided daily with hot water for hygienic purposes. As regards the toilet, the applicant submitted that it had had no flush system and the inmates washed it with water from a bucket. The Government stated that the toilet in cells nos. 49, 020 and 54 had a flush system which filled with water run from a tap. The applicant also submitted that during the period of her detention in cell no. 54 the toilet was not disinfected even once. 83. According to the applicant, the lavatory pan was separated by a partition from the sink but not from the living area and dining table. The detainees' attempts to separate the toilet from them with curtains made of sheets were suppressed by the prison authorities. In the Government's submission, the sanitary installations were separated from the living area with a partition which was one metre high and offered privacy. The photographs show that the lavatory pan is separated from the living area by a thick partition and that in cells nos. 49 and 54 there is also a curtain in front of the pan. 84. According to the applicant, the cells were overrun with cockroaches, mice and rats. The Government stated that all the cells were disinfected twice a month during the summer period and once a month in the winter. 85. The parties did not dispute the fact that throughout the period of the applicant's detention in the IZ-62/1 she had had a personal sleeping place. According to the applicant, she was provided with a mattress, although it was of poor quality, and was allowed to take her own warm blanket, pillow and bed linen. The Government insisted that the prison authorities had provided the applicant with bedding, including a mattress, a pillow, a semi-woollen blanket, three sheets, two pillowcases and a towel, and that she had signed for these in a register of provision of detainees with bedding. They did not submit the document relied on. A certificate of 21 August 2007 indicates that the relevant documentation cannot be provided, since the time-limit for its storage does not exceed five years. According to the Government, the bed linen was changed weekly. 86. The parties further agreed that the applicant was allowed to take a shower once a week for 30 minutes. The applicant alleged, however, that she had to wash herself, along with ten to fifteen other detainees, using wash-basins in a room measuring 4 x 4 metres which adjoined another room measuring 2 x 2 metres. The latter room was equipped with two showers. According to her, the cellmates were provided with 50 grams of soap per week. 87. According to the applicant, the detainees were allowed exercise less than once a day for a period of thirty to sixty minutes. During the period of her detention in cell no. 53 she was taken for outdoor exercise on two or three occasions into a courtyard measuring approximately 2.5 x 2.5 metres. At the same time seven to ten detainees were walking in the courtyard. Each walk lasted about thirty minutes. The Government insisted that the applicant was allowed to take a walk every day for two hours during daylight hours. 88. In the applicant's submission, the scarce meals were of poor quality, but the prison authorities only allowed her to receive bread and flour products, sugar and tea from her family. She was not allowed to receive any dairy products, fish, meat or juices, which, according to the applicant, she needed in view of her gastrointestinal problems, or any other products such as jam or honey. According to the Government, the applicant, like all the other detainees, was provided with meals three times a day and received a well-balanced menu. In particular, she received daily 100 grams of cereals, 20 grams of noodles, 100 grams of meat, 100 grams of fish, 10 grams of fats, 15 grams of seed-oil, 30 grams of sugar, 500 grams of potatoes, 250 grams of vegetables and 550 grams of bread. A certificate of 21 August 2007 states that the relevant documentation cannot be provided, as it had been destroyed. 89. According to the applicant, before her placement in custody she had been suffering from heart, gastrointestinal and gynaecological conditions. In support of her submissions, she relied on medical documents confirming that she had undergone treatment in respect of those conditions in the 1990s. In particular, a certificate issued in March 2000 states that in November-December 1999 the applicant was diagnosed with hypertension and ischaemic heart disease and a certificate of 20 December 2000 confirms that the applicant had her gall bladder removed in 1991. There is also a certificate stating that the applicant was diagnosed with hysteromyoma. 90. The applicant further submitted that her health had deteriorated during her detention. In particular, she started suffering from gastritis, conjunctivitis, myopia and contracted a facial dermatological disease, demodicosis. The applicant adduced a copy of an extract from her medical file dated 18 April 2005 and medical documents of 26 February and 22 June 2006 confirming the presence of those diseases. In the applicant's submission, when in custody she repeatedly complained to the authorities about her poor state of health and requested an independent medical examination. She submitted copies of her written requests to various authorities. 91. In particular, on 6 April 2000 the applicant requested the head of the IZ-62/1 that she receive an independent medical examination. 92. On 24 April 2000 the applicant complained to the regional prosecutor that the medical examinations carried out in the IZ-62/1 were inadequate, that her medicines had been taken away and that the authorities had failed to have her independent medical examination carried out. She also complained that she had to share a cell with nine other detainees, all of them smokers, and that although the cells were severely infested with cockroaches the prison authorities made no attempts to exterminate them. 93. In a letter of 10 May 2000 the regional prosecutor's office informed the applicant about regulations which provided that medicine prescribed to suspects should be kept by a duty officer and taken by patients in the presence of that officer. In respect of the applicant's request to order an independent medical examination, the letter stated that there was no such obligation on the authorities. Lastly, the applicant was invited to address her complaints concerning sanitary conditions in the cell to the administration of the IZ-62/1 or to the administration of the Department for Execution of Punishments. 94. In her complaint of 17 May 2000 concerning the extension of her pre-trial detention (see paragraph 24 above) the applicant referred, inter alia, to poor conditions of her detention, stating that she was being kept in a poorly lit cell with smokers, that her sight had deteriorated, that her medicines had been seized and that she had not received adequate medical treatment and had been refused an independent medical examination. 95. On 22 May 2000 the applicant sent another complaint to the regional prosecutor, in which she again mentioned the authorities' failure to have her independent medical examination carried out and complained of deterioration of her sight, high blood pressure and aggravation of her health problems. 96. In May-July 2000 the applicant suffered from an inflammatory condition on her face which, according to her, proved to be demodicosis. In her submission, the treatment she received from prison doctors was ineffective. On 13 and 14 June 2000 the applicant sent complaints to the head of the regional Department for Execution of Punishments and the regional prosecutor in which she informed them that she was in need of urgent professional medical treatment for her acute facial condition, which could not be administered to her in the remand centre, and requested that she either be examined by specialists in connection with that condition, or admitted to a hospital for inpatient treatment. 97. On 3 August 2000 the applicant complained in writing to the head of the IZ-62/1 that there was no adequate medical assistance in connection with her heart condition and that medicines for injection and syringes which had been delivered by her family members had been taken away. She also mentioned that the cell in which she was being held was never ventilated. 98. On 2 November 2000 the applicant, with reference to her heart, gastrointestinal and gynaecological problems and the deterioration of her health in detention, requested the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Town Court to order an independent medical examination. On 12 November 2000 the applicant forwarded a similar request to the head of the IZ-62/1. 99. On 17 November 2000 the head of the IZ-62/1 sent a written request to the Town Court to allow an independent medical examination of the applicant. 100. According to the applicant, despite numerous requests, she had no proper medical treatment and her medicines were taken from her by the prison authorities. In the spring 2001 the prison authorities accepted from the applicant's relatives medicines for treatment of heart diseases and disposable syringes. However, according to the applicant, she was not administered any injection until the autumn of 2001 after her numerous complaints to the authorities. In the Government's submission, all the medicines received by the prison authorities from the applicant's relatives were delivered to the applicant, except for medicines for injection and syringes. 101. A copy of the applicant's medical file made during her detention in the IZ-62/1 submitted by the Government reveals the following. 102. On 29 March 2000, on the applicant's arrival at the remand centre, she underwent a medical examination which established that she was fit. During the examination the applicant stated that her gall bladder had been extracted and complained of pain in the small of her back. She made no other complaints. 103. On 31 March 2000 a duty paramedic attended the applicant in the cell, at her request. The officer took the applicant's blood pressure. 104. On 7 April 2000, upon the applicant's complaint of slight headaches and some bleeding from the ears, she was examined by a general practitioner and diagnosed with vegetative-vascular dystonia. The applicant was prescribed and administered medication. 105. On 12 April 2000 the applicant was received by the head of the IZ62/1 medical office in connection with her complaint that her medicines had been taken away. Some of the medicines were returned to her. The head of the medical office also took the applicant's blood pressure. 106. On 19 April 2000 the applicant was examined by a medical commission of the Central Hospital of the Department for Execution of Punishments, including a general practitioner and a surgeon. She complained of pain in the right pre-costal area and constipation. The applicant was diagnosed with biliary dyskinesia and prescribed pain-relieving medicines. Her general state of health was found to be satisfactory. 107. On 24 April 2000 the applicant's blood pressure was measured. 108. On 12 May 2000 the applicant refused to undergo a gynaecological examination by a gynaecologist from the city maternity and gynaecology hospital, stating that the person assigned to carry it out was incompetent. She insisted on an independent gynaecological examination as well as examinations by a dermatologist and an ophthalmologist. 109. On the same date the applicant was examined by the head of the ophthalmological department of the regional hospital, diagnosed with slight myopia and prescribed glasses. 110. On 16 May 2000 the applicant was examined by a duty paramedic in connection with the inflammation of her face. She was diagnosed with allergic dermatitis and prescribed antihistamine pills and ointment. 111. The next day the applicant was examined by a psychiatrist in connection with her complaints of insomnia and itching and eruptions on her face. The doctor concluded that she was “almost fit”. 112. On 22 May 2000 the applicant was examined by a duty paramedic in connection with her complaints of nausea, weakness and shooting pains in the heart area. She was diagnosed with presumed cardio neurosis and prescribed relevant treatment. 113. On 26 May 2000, upon the applicant's complaint to the effect that she was unable to take part in a court hearing scheduled for that day because of her poor physical condition, she was examined by a general practitioner who concluded that she was fit. 114. On 28 May 2000 the applicant was examined by a dermatologist in connection with her complaint of eruptions on her face. She was diagnosed with allergic dermatitis and prescribed antihistamines, vitamins and ointments. 115. On 29 May 2000 the applicant was examined by a general practitioner who diagnosed her with presumed osteochondrosis and premenopausal syndrome and prescribed relevant treatment. 116. On 5 June 2000 the applicant was examined by the head of the IZ62/1 medical office, who concluded that her dermatological condition was satisfactory. 117. The next day the applicant was examined by a dermatologist who also confirmed that she was fit. 118. On 21 June 2000 the applicant had a conversation with the head of the IZ-62/1 medical office as regards the administration of medicines for treatment of heart disease received from the applicant's family members. The applicant was invited to undergo an electrocardiographic monitoring necessary prior to the administration of that medicine, but she refused the monitoring, stating that the device was outdated. 119. On 22 June 2000 the applicant was attended and examined by the head of the Tselitel medical centre, who concluded that the applicant was suffering from premenopausal syndrome and suggested that she undergo treatment with hormonal medicines. 120. On 12 July 2000 the applicant was examined by a general practitioner, who diagnosed her with influenza and administered relevant treatment. 121. On 9 August 2000 the applicant was examined by a general practitioner, who found that she had post-cholecystectomy syndrome. She was prescribed relevant treatment. 122. On 30 August 2000 the applicant was examined by a duty paramedic as she stated that she had been on hunger strike since 25 August 2000. The paramedic weighed the applicant and took her blood pressure. Her physical condition was found to be satisfactory. 123. On 13 October 2000 a general practitioner examined the applicant, took her blood pressure and, at the applicant's request, prescribed her the medicines which had been delivered by her family members. 124. On 26 October 2000 the applicant was examined by a general practitioner and diagnosed with influenza. Relevant treatment was prescribed. 125. On 14 November 2000 the applicant was examined by a duty paramedic in connection with her complaint of headaches and weakness. The paramedic found that she had vegetative-vascular dystonia and recommended relevant treatment. 126. On 28 December 2000 a general practitioner diagnosed the applicant with acute laryngotracheitis and prescribed relevant treatment. 127. On 18 January 2001 the applicant was attended and treated by a general practitioner in connection with pharyngitis and vegetative-vascular dystonia. 128. On 8 February 2001 the applicant was examined by a general practitioner, diagnosed with acute tracheobronchitis and prescribed relevant treatment. 129. On 13 February 2001 the applicant was attended and treated by a general practitioner in connection with protracted tracheitis. On 15 February 2001 the general practitioner again examined the applicant and recommended that the treatment be continued. 130. On 6 March 2002 the applicant was examined by a general practitioner and diagnosed with follicular tonsillitis. Relevant treatment was prescribed. On 10 March 2002 she was attended by a duty paramedic who recommended that she continue with the treatment. 131. During the period of her detention in remand centre IZ-62/1 the applicant underwent fluorography examinations on six occasions; the examination disclosed no pathologies. 132. On 3 March 2000 the investigator in charge ordered the seizure of the applicant's flat pending trial. 133. On 16 March 2000 a deputy regional prosecutor rejected the applicant's complaint against the investigator's order. 134. On 28 July 2000 the applicant applied to a court, stating that the flat in question was the only housing for her family and therefore was immune from seizure. 135. On 8 August 2000 the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Town Court found in the applicant's favour and lifted the seizure. 136. On 3 October 2000, on an appeal by the regional prosecutor, the Sakhalin Regional Court quashed the above judgment and remitted the case to the first-instance court. 137. It appears that, following the applicant's conviction, on 11 March 2002, the Town Court lifted the seizure of the applicant's flat in a separate set of proceedings. The court noted that this apartment was the permanent place of residence for the applicant's family and was not subject to confiscation. 138. On 12 March 2002 the Town Court discontinued the proceedings on the applicant's action of 28 July 2000, since she had waived her claims. 139. Article 96 (Taking into custody) provides that taking into custody as a measure of restraint may be imposed in cases concerning criminal offences punishable by law with more than one year's imprisonment. The Article also refers to a number of serious criminal offences, including embezzlement, and provides that in respect of persons charged with those offences, taking into custody as a preventive measure may be applied on the sole ground of the danger presented by the criminal offence committed. 140. Article 97 (Periods of detention) provides that the duration of detention during the investigation of criminal cases may not exceed two months. This period may be extended by a relevant prosecutor to up to three months, and further detention can be authorised by a regional prosecutor (or a prosecutor of equal rank) to up to a maximum of six months. Extension of detention beyond six months is allowed in exceptional cases only with regard to persons charged with serious criminal offences, and can be authorised by a deputy Prosecutor General for a period of up to one year, and by the Prosecutor General for a period of up to one and a half years. Further extension of detention is not allowed: the person must be released immediately. 141. 142. Article 223-1 (Ordering a court session) provides that, if an accused is kept in custody, a judge shall take a decision to order a court session within fourteen days of the date when the criminal case was received by the court.","['3', '5']","['5-1', '5-3']",[],[],[],[],1

POLAND,4,Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial,David Thór Björgvinsson;Ján Šikuta;Lech Garlicki;Mihai Poalelungi;Nicolas Bratza;Päivi Hirvelä,"5. The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Sosnowiec, Poland. 6. On 8 April 1999 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of homicide. She was first interviewed by a police officer. On 9 April 1999 she was charged with murdering E.L on 8 April 1999. On 9 and 10 April 1999 she was questioned by the Sosnowiec District Prosecutor. During the questioning she stated that she had been having alcohol problems for the last 20 years. She and E.L., a former work colleague, used to drink together. On 7 April 1999 they had drunk more than half a litre of vodka and some wine. She also stated that she did not remember much of what had happened. She further confessed to killing E.L. Nevertheless, she stressed that she had not meant to kill the victim, but he had made her very angry and she had stabbed him with scissors. 7. During the arrest and subsequent questioning by the police and the prosecution authorities the applicant was not assisted by a lawyer. On 9 April 1999 the applicant signed the relevant form acknowledging that she had been informed of her rights, including the right to be assisted by a lawyer and the right to refuse to testify. 8. On 19 April 1999 the prosecutor ordered an expert report on the applicant’s mental health at the time when the crime of which she was suspected was committed. The report was submitted on 26 April 1999. The applicant was considered to be criminally responsible. 9. On 21 April 1999 the applicant asked to be released from detention. The District Prosecutor refused her motion on 11 May 1999. This decision was upheld by the Regional Prosecutor on 7 June 1999. 10. On 23 April 1999 the Regional Court appointed a legal-aid-lawyer for the applicant. On 5 May 1999 the applicant appointed a lawyer of her own choice. 11. On 28 June 1999 the Sosnowiec District Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Katowice Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy). The applicant was indicted on charges of murder. 12. Throughout the trial the applicant maintained that she suffered from alcoholism. She retracted her confession made during police custody, alleging that she had been questioned under duress and forced by the police officers to make self-incriminating statements. 13. On 30 June 1999 the Katowice Regional Court, having regard to the fact that the applicant was represented by a lawyer of her own choice, decided to withdraw the services of the legal-aid lawyer. 14. The trial ended on 24 February 2000. The applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to 11 years’ imprisonment. The court considered that the applicant’s testimony during the trial had not been credible and had merely been her line of defence. The conviction was based on the applicant’s statements made during the initial phase of the investigation and on evidence given by several witnesses. 15. On 11 April 2000 the applicant’s lawyer filed an appeal against the judgment. He stressed, in particular, that there had been a violation of the applicant’s right to defend herself in view of the deficiencies in the preliminary investigation. 16. On 25 May 2000 the Katowice Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) upheld the firstinstance judgment. The court held that the applicant’s right to defend herself had not been infringed. It pointed out that as of 23 April 1999 she had been assisted by a lawyer – first an officially appointed lawyer, then a lawyer of her own choice. 17. On 19 July 2000 the applicant’s lawyer filed a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy). He maintained that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention in that the applicant had not been assisted by a lawyer at the preliminary stage of the investigation. He relied on the caselaw of the European Court of Human Rights. 18. On 26 January 2001 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s cassation appeal. That decision did not contain any reasons. 19. Pursuant to Article 78 § 1 of the 1998 Code of Criminal Procedure, an accused who had proved that he or she could not afford legal assistance (i.e. that the costs of such assistance “would entail a substantial reduction in his and his family’s standard of living”) could ask the trial court to appoint him a defence counsel. 20. Article 80 of the Code lays down the principle known as “compulsory assistance of an advocate” (przymus adwokacki). That Article provides, in so far as relevant: “An accused must have an officially appointed lawyer when a Regional Court is competent to deal with his case as a court of first instance, a crime is involved within the meaning of the Criminal Code, or the individual is remanded in custody. The counsel must take part in the main hearing; he must also take part in any appellate hearing if the president of the court or the court itself has found this necessary.” This provision does not apply to the investigative stage of the proceedings but only after the case is sent for trial, as was expressly confirmed by the Supreme Court in its resolution of 20 January 2004 (III KK 226/03).",['6'],[],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1933 and lives in Amorosi (Benevento). 9. In a judgment deposited with the court's registry on 30 June 1997, the Benevento District Court made a winding-up order in respect of the applicant's company, a beverage company, and also declared the applicant personally bankrupt. 10. On 15 October 1997 the trustee in bankruptcy filed a report. 11. On 9 April 1998 the bankruptcy judge (“the judge”) checked the statement of liabilities of the bankrupt estate and on 7 June 1999 declared it judicially established (esecutivo). 12. On 1, 5 and 9 July 1999 respectively the companies C.D.O., C.C.C. and F.C. instituted proceedings contesting the statement of liabilities. 13. At a hearing held on 14 April 2000, the judge ordered the striking out of the action brought by the company F.C. as being out of time. 14. On 18 December 2000 the trustee in bankruptcy requested the creditors' committee to give its opinion on the possible sale of two lorries in very poor condition which were listed in the statement of assets. 15. On 8 January 2001 the trustee in bankruptcy requested the judge to declare the lorries unfit for sale (illiquidabili) so that the proceedings could be terminated. 16. On 5 February 2001 the trustee in bankruptcy filed the revenue and expenditure account, which the judge approved on 12 March 2001. 17. By a decision deposited with the registry on 20 March 2001, the judge terminated the bankruptcy proceedings for lack of any further assets to distribute. 18. The decision was posted in the District Court on 23 March 2001. It became final on 7 April 2001. 19. The Bankruptcy Act (Royal Decree no. 267 of 16 March 1942) provides, inter alia: “An appeal shall lie against the decisions of the bankruptcy judge ... to the district court within three days of their adoption, and may be lodged by the trustee in bankruptcy, the bankrupt, the creditors' committee or any other person with an interest. The district court shall deliberate in private and give a reasoned decision. The appeal shall not have suspensive effect in relation to the impugned decision.” “An appeal shall lie against measures taken by the trustee in bankruptcy. Such appeals may be lodged by the bankrupt, or any other person with an interest, with the bankruptcy judge, who shall give a reasoned decision. An appeal against that decision may be lodged within three days with the district court. That court shall give a reasoned decision after hearing evidence from the trustee in bankruptcy and the appellant.” “The bankruptcy order shall divest the bankrupt of the rights to administer or to deal with assets that were in existence at the date of the said order. ...” “Correspondence addressed to the bankrupt shall be passed to the trustee in bankruptcy, who shall be empowered to retain correspondence concerning property interests. The bankrupt may consult the correspondence. The trustee in bankruptcy shall keep the content of correspondence not relating to such interests confidential.” “The bankrupt may not leave his place of residence without the authorisation of the bankruptcy judge and must report to that judge, the trustee in bankruptcy or the creditors' committee each time he is duly summoned, except where he is unable to appear on legitimate grounds and the judge gives him leave to send a representative. If the bankrupt fails to comply with a summons, the judge may order that he be brought by the police.” “A public register of the names of bankrupts shall be held at the registry of each district court. Names shall be deleted from the register by order of the district court. A bankrupt shall be subject to the restrictions laid down by law until such time as his name is deleted from the register.” “The bankruptcy proceedings shall be terminated by means of a reasoned decision of the court ... An appeal against that decision may be lodged with the court of appeal within fifteen days of its being posted in the court ...” “Rehabilitation may be granted to bankrupts who 1. have paid in full the debts included in the bankruptcy, including interest and expenses; 2. have complied with the terms of the composition with creditors if the court considers them eligible for such a measure, taking into account the causes and circumstances of the bankruptcy, the terms of the composition and the percentage agreed. Rehabilitation may not be granted in cases where the percentage agreed for unsecured creditors is below 25% ...; 3. have shown proof of effective and consistent good conduct for at least five years following the end of the bankruptcy proceedings.” 20. Article 2 § 1 (a) of Presidential Decree no. 223 of 20 March 1967, as amended by Law no. 15 of 16 January 1992, provides essentially for the suspension of the bankrupt's electoral rights for the duration of the bankruptcy proceedings and, in any event, for a period not exceeding five years from the date of the bankruptcy order. 21. Legislative Decree (decreto legislativo) no. 5 of 9 January 2006 on the reform of the Bankruptcy Act provides, inter alia, as follows: “Article 48 of Royal Decree no. 267 of 16 March 1942 is hereby replaced by the following: 'Article 48 (correspondence addressed to bankrupts): Entrepreneurs who are declared bankrupt and the directors or liquidators of companies or corporations which are the subject of bankruptcy proceedings shall be required to hand over to the trustee in bankruptcy all correspondence, and in particular electronic correspondence, concerning property interests [rapporti] included in the bankruptcy.' ” “Article 49 of Royal Decree no. 267 of 16 March 1942 is hereby replaced by the following: 'Article 49 (obligations of bankrupts): Entrepreneurs who are declared bankrupt and the directors or liquidators of companies or corporations which are the subject of bankruptcy proceedings shall be required to inform the trustee in bankruptcy of any change of residence or address. Where information or clarification is needed for the conduct of the proceedings, the above-mentioned individuals must report in person to the bankruptcy judge, the trustee in bankruptcy or the creditors' committee. If they are unable to do so, the judge may give leave to the entrepreneur or the legal representative of the company or corporation which is the subject of the bankruptcy proceedings to send a representative.' ” “Article 50 of Royal Decree no. 267 of 16 March 1942 is hereby repealed.” “The following provisions are hereby repealed: (a) Article 2 § 1 (a) ... of Presidential Decree no. 223 of 20 March 1967; ...” 22. According to legal commentators, the institution of bankruptcy has its origins in the Middle Ages (thirteenth century), an era when merchants (in the broad sense, encompassing traders, entrepreneurs and bankers) formed the nucleus of a new social class. In this context, in which the public interest coincided at times with the interests of the merchant class, bankruptcy was designed to impose stringent measures on insolvent merchants. Hence, bankruptcy was subject to criminal penalties (such as banishment, arrest and, in some cases, torture or death) or civil penalties such as the entry of the bankrupt's name in a register, forcing bankrupts to wear distinguishing marks (such as a green beret), loss of citizenship, and other restrictions (see A. Jorio, La crisi d'impresa, il fallimento, Guiffré, 2000, p. 364; S. Bonfatti and P.F. Censoni, Manuale di diritto fallimentare, Cedam, 2004, pp. 1-2 and 72-73; and L.

FRANCE,2,Violation of Art. 6-1;Preliminary objection rejected (victim);Preliminary objection rejected (non-exhaustion of domestic remedies);Violation of P1-1;Pecuniary damage - reserved;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - domestic proceedings;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings,,"6. In a decision of 7 October 1982 the Prefect of the département of Essonne made a declaration that it was in the public interest to acquire by compulsory purchase land needed for the development of a residential area in the town of Saint-Michel-sur-Orge, known as the Fontaine de l’Orme project. The land included a plot belonging to the applicant on which stood a building used as a secondary residence by a member of her family. 7. On 10 September 1982 the mayor of Saint-Michel-sur-Orge had applied to the Essonne expropriations judge, who on 6 December 1982 made an expropriation order transferring the applicant’s land to the municipality and setting the amount of compensation to be paid to her. On 28 March 1983 the applicant appealed against the order. 8. On 28 July 1983 the Evry New Town Development Corporation (EPEVRY), which was responsible for carrying out the scheme, informed Mrs Guillemin that she should have vacated the land by 14 July 1983. In the same month the town council demolished the fence, the buildings, the infrastructure for the supply of services, the vegetable garden and the orchard on the land. 9. On 14 October 1983, on the appeal by the expropriated applicant, the Expropriations Division of the Paris Court of Appeal increased the amount of the expropriation compensation to 221,858 French francs (FRF), which is currently held in deposit at the Bank for Official Deposits (Essonne Treasury). 10. On 19 November 1982 Mrs Guillemin had brought proceedings in the Versailles Administrative Court. On 24 October 1985 the court set aside the public-interest declaration on the grounds that it was ultra vires. It held that the declaration should have been made in a decree after consultation of the Conseil d’Etat and not in a prefectoral decision (see paragraph 23 below). The inspector appointed to conduct the inquiry prior to the declaration in question had recommended that the scheme should not include existing houses that had sufficient land to make a garden for family use, as was the case with the applicant’s property. 11. The town council appealed on 26 December 1985 and lodged a pleading on 28 April 1986. In a judgment of 13 March 1989 the Conseil d’Etat upheld the Administrative Court’s judgment. It refused Mrs Guillemin’s application for formal note to be taken that the town council had automatically abandoned the proceedings as it had failed to file a supplementary pleading in time, and also refused her claim for compensation, which had been submitted for the first time on appeal. 12. The applicant lodged two appeals on points of law with the Court of Cassation, the first against the expropriation order of 6 December 1982 and the second against the judgment of the Paris Court of Appeal of 14 October 1983. In two judgments of 4 January 1990 the Court of Cassation (Third Civil Division) set aside the expropriation order providing for the transfer of ownership and ""in consequence"" set aside the judgment of the Paris Court of Appeal, which had ruled on the expropriation compensation. These judgments were served on the town council on 22 May 1990. 13. On 20 June 1990 Mrs Guillemin applied unsuccessfully to the town council, seeking either restoration of her rights or compensation in the amount of FRF 4,194,655.65. 14. On 10 November and 17 December 1990 Mrs Guillemin applied to Evry State Counsel. On 11 March 1991 he decided to take no action. 15. On 23 December 1991 the applicant challenged the town council’s implied decision to refuse her application in the Versailles Administrative Court. Her claim for restoration of her rights was accompanied by an application for compensation for non-pecuniary damage and loss of enjoyment of her property, which she assessed at FRF 1,971,795. 16. On 13 January 1992 she brought proceedings in the Evry tribunal de grande instance against the mayor of Saint-Michel-sur-Orge and EPEVRY, seeking an order for demolition of the buildings erected on her land by the town council, with periodic penalties in the event of failure to comply, and damages. In joint submissions the defendants argued that it was not possible to return the property. It had been sold to EPEVRY with a view to a housing development and the individual building plots had in turn been sold to various different purchasers and had now been built on and were occupied. 17. On 1 February 1993 the Evry tribunal de grande instance deferred judgment until the Versailles Administrative Court ruled and listed the case for the hearing that was to be held on 10 June 1993 by the judge in charge of preparing the case for trial. 18. The Administrative Court held a hearing on 10 May 1994 and gave judgment on 24 May 1994. It held that the claim for return of the land was inadmissible on the ground that ""it [was] not for the administrative courts to issue orders to the authorities"" and ruled as follows on the claim for compensation: ""It is clear from the preparation of the case for trial that the expropriation ... in the public interest [on] 7 October 1982 was carried out unlawfully. The dispossession of [Mrs Guillemin] was accordingly an illegal expropriation of private property. It is for the ordinary courts alone, which protect private property, to deal with [her] claim for compensation for the loss [she allegedly] sustained as a result of the dispossession or of any direct consequences of it."" 19. In the meantime, on 3 March 1994, Mrs Guillemin’s application had been struck off the list of the Evry tribunal de grande instance. It was entered in the list again on 25 November 1994. On 5 January 1995 the applicant filed fresh submissions seeking compensation. 20. In a judgment of 23 October 1995 the Evry tribunal de grande instance noted that Mrs Guillemin had implicitly abandoned her application for the buildings on her land to be demolished and held that she was entitled to compensation from the expropriating town council. It deferred judgment on the compensation claim, ordered an expert report on the value of the expropriated plot of land as at December 1982 and on the loss arising from her being deprived of her land and the price of it since then, and ruled that the town council should pay an advance on the costs of the expert report. 21. The expert received the file on 27 November 1995. He summoned the parties to an inspection of the site on 12 March 1996 and filed his report on 29 July 1996. He assessed the total value at FRF 1,602,805, which he broke down as follows: FRF 462,139 for the value of the property, covering the sum needed to purchase a similar property, FRF 746,338 for the interest on the principal sum from 14 July 1983 to 30 September 1996 and FRF 394,328 compensation for loss of the enjoyment of the property over the same period. For this last item he adopted a rate of return of 6.50% on the value of the property, excluding the sum needed to purchase a similar property. 22. The proceedings are at present pending in the Evry tribunal de grande instance. 23. Expropriation proceedings in the public interest comprise two separate stages. The first stage is administrative. It begins with a preliminary inquiry - opened by a prefectoral decision - to gather information on the grounds for the expropriation. The inspector appointed to conduct the inquiry has one month from the date on which it ends to consider observations from the public, to draw up his findings and then to forward the file to the administrative authority. If his opinion is unfavourable, or is favourable subject to conditions that the expropriating authority is not minded to satisfy, the public-interest declaration must be made in a decree adopted after consultation of the Conseil d’Etat rather than in a prefectoral decision. This declaration establishes that the scheme is in the public interest. The expropriation liability order subsequently made by the Prefect identifies the property to be expropriated and ends the administrative stage of the expropriation. The next step in the procedure is for the expropriating authority to forward the expropriation liability order, within six months of its publication, to the judicial authority for expropriation matters, a judge of the ordinary court, failing which it will lapse. 24. The second stage takes place before the expropriations judge. He alone has the power to order expropriation and assess compensation. He does not, however, have competence to assess the lawfulness of the steps taken by the administrative authority. On receipt of the expropriation liability order that has been forwarded to him, he will issue an expropriation order transferring ownership to the expropriating authority and depriving the former owner of the right to dispose of his property. The former owner, however, retains the use of it as a provisional occupier until compensation for the loss of possession is paid or, in the event of a dispute, deposited. The proceedings for issuing the expropriation order are separate from those leading to the judicial assessment of the expropriation compensation; they are generally conducted entirely by the expropriating administrative authority. This second set of proceedings may commence as soon as the prefectoral decision to open the public inquiry has been taken. The calculation of the expropriation compensation takes into account the value of the expropriated property, all the costs necessarily incurred in purchasing a replacement and, as subsidiary compensation, the depreciation in value of the remaining property where only part of it has been expropriated. The compensation amount may always be fixed by agreement, even after the expropriation order has been issued. 25. Anyone affected by an expropriation that enables a scheme in the public interest to be carried out may challenge the validity of the public-interest declaration in the administrative court within two months of its publication. Appeals against expropriation liability orders must be brought within the same time. As a prefectoral decision to open a public-interest inquiry is seen as a purely preliminary measure, its lawfulness may only be challenged in conjunction with one of those two remedies. Any application on the merits may be accompanied by an application for a stay of execution, but appeals to the administrative courts do not in any event have a suspensive effect and do not prevent the expropriation proceedings continuing in the ordinary courts. 26. The only means of challenging an expropriation order is by lodging an appeal on points of law within two weeks of the order being served. An appeal against a judgment in which compensation has been assessed may be brought within two weeks of the decision being served and any appeal on points of law must then be brought within two months of the Court of Appeal’s judgment being served. These appeals do not have a suspensive effect and do not prevent possession being taken of the expropriated property. Lastly, if the compensation has not been either paid or deposited by the expropriating authority within a year of the decision whereby it was assessed, the person expropriated may seek review of it by the expropriations judge. 27. Once a public-interest declaration has been set aside, there is no legal basis for the expropriation order. If, however, the declaration is set aside after the order has become final, the expropriation cannot be legally challenged. It is accepted that a further public inquiry may be held to rectify the situation. In any event, the adage ""public buildings that have been erected unlawfully are not demolished"" applies.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

RUSSIA,4,Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Civil proceedings;Article 6-1 - Reasonable time),Anatoly Kovler;Elisabeth Steiner;George Nicolaou,"4. The applicant was born in 1942 and lives in Budennovsk of the Stavropol Region. 5. On 5 February 1998 the applicant was stopped by the police and brought to a sobering-up centre. He was examined by a doctor who found that he was sober. The applicant was immediately released. 6. On 18 November 1998 the applicant sued the local police department for compensation for unlawful arrest. The applicant’s complaint was admitted by the Budennovsk Town Court of the Stavropol Region (“the Town Court”). The first hearing was scheduled for 25 December 1998, but on that date it did not take place. No action was taken on the case until December 2001. 7. On 25 December 2001 the Town Court identified the Ministry of the Interior Affairs as the respondent and involved the local police department as a third party in the proceedings. 8. On 30 December 2002 the Town Court held in a default judgment that the applicant’s arrest had been unlawful and partly allowed his claim for compensation. 9. On 29 January 2003 the Town Court granted an extension of the time allowed for submission by the respondent of their grounds of appeal. 10. On 6 February 2003 the Stavropol Regional Court (“the Regional Court”) overturned the judgment on appeal for failure to notify the respondent about the hearing in a timely manner and remitted the case to the first instance. 11. On 20 February 2003 the Town Court again allowed the applicant’s claim in part, but on 23 April 2003 the judgment was set aside on appeal by the Regional Court for failure to involve the finance authorities in the proceedings. The appeal court required a new hearing. It also delivered a special ruling in which it reprimanded the judge in charge of the applicant’s case for breaches of the procedural time-limits for consideration of the case. 12. On 6 June 2003 the Town Court judge withdrew from the proceedings. 13. On 4 July 2003 the Town Court rejected the applicant’s claims as unsubstantiated. 14. On 20 August 2003 the Regional Court set aside the judgment on appeal and allowed the applicant’s claim in part. It held that his arrest had been unlawful and ordered that the Budennovsk town administration pay the applicant 5,000 Russian roubles (RUB). 15. On an unspecified day the town administration lodged an application for supervisory review of the decision of 20 August 2003. 16. On 8 December 2003 the Presidium of the Regional Court granted the application, quashed the judgment of 20 August 2003 for failure to notify the town administration about the hearing and remitted the case to the Regional Court. 17. On 1 March 2004 the Regional Court quashed the judgment of 4 July 2003 and remitted the case to the Town Court. 18. On 7 May 2004 the Town Court designated the Ministry of Finance of the Stavropol Region as a co-respondent. 19. On 12 July 2004 the Town Court granted the applicant’s claim in part and ordered that the Ministry of Finance of the Stavropol Region pay the applicant RUB 15,000. 20.

POLAND,4,Violation of Art. 5-3;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings,Nicolas Bratza,"4. The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Reda, Poland. 5. On 27 January 1999 the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed armed robbery. On 29 January 1999 the Tczew District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) ordered that he be detained on remand in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question, the severity of the anticipated penalty and the fear that he might tamper with evidence. The court also observed that other measures designed to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings would be insufficient, given the fact that at the time of the commission of the offence the applicant had already been released under police supervision in another case. That, in the court's opinion, convincingly showed that only detention could prevent him from committing another offence. 6. On 20 April 1999 the Gdańsk Regional Court prolonged the applicant's detention. It reiterated the grounds originally given for his detention. Referring to the fact that more lenient preventive measures had not prevented the applicant from having committed another offence, the court considered that there was a reasonable risk that the applicant would abscond. Furthermore, it considered that since the applicant had not admitted the charge and that there had been other persons involved in the offence who had remained at large, there was a reasonable risk of collusion. 7. In the course of the investigation, the applicant's detention was several times prolonged by the Gdańsk Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny). The court reiterated the grounds originally given for his detention and stressed that keeping him in custody was necessary to secure the process of obtaining evidence. The relevant decisions were given on 21 July 1999 (prolonging the applicant's detention until 31 December 1999) and 8 December 1999 (prolonging his detention until 27 January 2000). The applicant's appeals against those decisions – in which he contested the reasonableness of the charge against him – were rejected by the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy). 8. On 21 January 2000 the Supreme Court prolonged the applicant's detention – which had meanwhile exceeded the 1 year's time-limit set for detention pending the investigation under Article 263 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure – until 30 April 2000. It considered that the case was “particularly complex” within the meaning of Article 263 § 4 of the Code. 9. On 30 March 2000 the Supreme Court prolonged his detention until 30 June 2000. On 24 May 2000 the Supreme Court ordered that that term should further be prolonged until 15 December 2000. The court reiterated the previous grounds given for the applicant's detention and added that the case was very complex, given that 6 further suspects had in the meantime been charged and detained in the case and that several other potential suspects were still being searched for. 10. In the meantime, new charges were laid against the applicant. 11. Further prolongation of the applicant's detention pending the investigation were ordered by the Gdańsk Court of Appeal on 13 December 2000 (up to 31 March 2001) and on 7 March 2001 (up to 31 May 2001). In its decision of 13 December 2000, the Court of Appeal relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged and the severity of anticipated penalty. It also considered that there was a reasonable risk that the applicant and the other 8 detained co-suspects, if released, might obstruct the proceedings or attempt to evade justice, having regard to the nature and the scale of the offences with which they had been charged (numerous counts of armed robberies) and the number of suspects involved. In its decision of 7 March 2001, the Court of Appeal added that the prolongation of detention was justified by the need to obtain DNA evidence. 12. On 15 May 2001 the Gdańsk Regional Prosecutor (Prokurator Okręgowy) indicted the applicant on 48 charges comprising, among other things, numerous counts of armed robbery before the Gdańsk Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy). The bill of indictment listed 120 charges brought against 19 accused, who were all remanded in custody. The case-file comprised 114 volumes. The prosecution asked the court to hear evidence from 366 witnesses. It appears that the principal witness was a certain A.Ł., who had been indicted together with all the defendants but gave evidence against them. 13. The trial began on 28 December 2001. However, as at April 2002 the reading out of the bill of indictment by the prosecution was still continuing. 14. During the trial, the Gdańsk Court of Appeal prolonged the applicant's detention several times. The relevant decisions were given on 23 May 2001 (extending his detention up to 31 October 2001), on 24 October 2001 (ordering his continued detention until 31 March 2002), on 13 March 2002 (prolonging that period until 30 September 2002), 11 September 2002 (extending his detention until 31 December 2002), on 18 December 2002 (prolonging his detention until 30 June 2003), on 25 June 2003 (prolonging his detention until 31 December 2003), on 17 December 2003 (extending that term until 30 June 2004), on 23 June 2004 (extending that term until 31 December 2004), on 15 December 2004 (ordering his continued detention until 31 March 2005) and on 30 March 2005 (extending that period until 30 June 2005). As at the latter date, 8 of the 19 accused were still detained on remand and the trial court had heard most of the prosecution witnesses. 15. In all those decisions the Court of Appeal considered that the original grounds given for the applicant's detention were still valid. It stressed that keeping him in custody was necessary in order to prevent him – and his co-defendants – from evading justice or tampering with evidence. 16. In its decision of 13 March 2002, the Court of Appeal found that holding the applicant and his 7 co-defendants in custody was the only measure which would prevent them from obstructing the trial, having regard to the nature of the offences in question, the severity of the anticipated penalty and the fact that such attempts had been made in the course of the investigation. It also instructed the trial court to increase the number of hearings held per month. 17. In its decision of 11 September 2002, the Court of Appeal considered that the applicant's detention was justified under Article 258 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure since that provision established a presumption to the effect that the likelihood of a severe penalty being imposed on the applicant might induce him to obstruct the proceedings. 18. In its decision of 23 June 2004, the Court of Appeal observed that up to April 2003 the main reason for the delays in the trial was the obstructiveness of the defendants and the abuse of the rights of the defence. 19. On 21 March 2005 the trial court made a severance order with a view to expediting the proceedings, and thereafter four defendants (J.N., G.P., Z.S. and Z.C.), who in the meantime had been released from detention, were to be tried separately from other defendants. 20. The applicant repeatedly, but unsuccessfully, asked for release and appealed against the decisions prolonging his detention. He maintained that the length of his detention was unreasonable and contested the charges against him, stressing that they were based on unreliable evidence from A.Ł. 21. It appears that the applicant is still in detention pending trial. 22. From 9 March 2000 to 15 April 2002 and from 21 June 2002 to 31 July 2002 (i.e. for 2 years, 2 months and 17 days) the applicant served a sentence of imprisonment imposed in other criminal proceedings. He was, however, simultaneously remanded in custody in the present case. 23. The Code of Criminal Procedure of 1997, which entered into force on 1 September 1998, defines detention on remand as one of the so-called “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze). The other measures are bail (poręczenie majątkowe), police supervision (dozór policji), guarantee by a responsible person (poręczenie osoby godnej zaufania), guarantee by a social entity (poręczenie społeczne), temporary ban on engaging in a given activity (zawieszenie oskarżonego w określonej działalności) and prohibition to leave the country (zakaz opuszczania kraju). 24. Article 249 § 1 sets out the general grounds for imposition of the preventive measures. That provision reads: “1. Preventive measures may be imposed in order to ensure the proper conduct of proceedings and, exceptionally, also in order to prevent an accused's committing another, serious offence; they may be imposed only if the evidence gathered shows a significant probability that an accused has committed an offence.” 25. Article 258 lists grounds for detention on remand. It provides, in so far as relevant: “1. Detention on remand may be imposed if: (1) there is a reasonable risk that an accused will abscond or go into hiding, in particular when his identity cannot be established or when he has no permanent abode [in Poland]; (2) there is a reasonable risk that an accused will attempt to induce [witnesses or co-defendants] to give false testimony or to obstruct the proper course of proceedings by any other unlawful means; 2. If an accused has been charged with a serious offence or an offence for the commission of which he may be liable to a statutory maximum sentence of at least 8 years' imprisonment, or if a court of first instance has sentenced him to at least 3 years' imprisonment, the need to continue detention to ensure the proper conduct of proceedings may be based on the likelihood that a severe penalty will be imposed.” 26. The Code sets out the margin of discretion as to the continuation of a specific preventive measure. Article 257 reads, in so far as relevant: “1. Detention on remand shall not be imposed if another preventive measure is sufficient.” 27. Article 259, in its relevant part, reads: “1. If there are no special reasons to the contrary, detention on remand shall be lifted, in particular if depriving an accused of his liberty would: (1) seriously jeopardise his life or health; or (2) entail excessively harsh consequences for the accused or his family.” 28. The 1997 Code not only sets out maximum statutory time-limits for detention on remand but also, in Article 252 § 2, lays down that the relevant court – within those time-limits – must in each detention decision determine the exact time for which detention shall continue. 29. Article 263 sets out time-limits for detention. In the version applicable up to 20 July 2000 it provided: “1. Imposing detention in the course of an investigation, the court shall determine its term for a period not exceeding 3 months. 3. The whole period of detention on remand until the date on which the first conviction at first instance is imposed may not exceed 2 years. 4. Only the Supreme Court may, on application made by the court before which the case is pending or, at the investigation stage, on application made by the Prosecutor General, prolong detention on remand for a further fixed period exceeding the periods referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3, when it is necessary in connection with a stay of the proceedings, for the purpose of a prolonged psychiatric observation of the accused or a prolonged preparation of an expert report, when evidence needs to be obtained in a particularly complex case or from abroad or when the accused has deliberately prolonged the proceedings, as well as on account of other significant obstacles that could not be overcome.” 30. On 20 July 2000 paragraph 4 was amended and since then the competence to prolong detention beyond the time-limits set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 has been vested with the court of appeal within whose jurisdiction the offence in question has been committed.",['5'],['5-3'],[],[],[],[],1

The State Budget Act provides that the writing-off of funds from the State budget pursuant to a court judgment delivered in favour of the employees of an organisation in receipt of budgetary funds, who are entitled to certain benefits, shall be carried out from the single treasury account of the State Treasury at the expense and within the limits of the budget allocations fixed for financing that organisation. 37. The State budget provided UAH 1,067,200 for the enforcement of judgments awarding judicial salaries and benefit arrears. 38. Section 20-1 of the Law provides that the bailiffs' departments of the Ministry of Justice shall be responsible for the enforcement of judgments concerning the debts of the executive branch of Government. 39. The Decree provides that the State Judicial Administration shall be responsible for organising the financial planning and accounting of the courts and for preparing an estimate of the courts' budgetary needs. 40. In accordance with section 4 of the Regulations, the State Treasury is responsible for the implementation of the State budget and for monitoring its expenditure. 41. The relevant extracts from the Recommendation read as follows: 1. Proper conditions should be provided to enable judges to work efficiently and, in particular, by: ... b. ensuring that the status and remuneration of judges is commensurate with the dignity of their profession and burden of responsibilities; ...” 42. The relevant extracts from the Explanatory Memorandum read as follows: “29. Status and remuneration are important factors determining appropriate working conditions (see paragraph 1.b). The status accorded to judges should be commensurate with the dignity of their profession and their remuneration should represent sufficient compensation for their burden of responsibilities. These factors are essential to the independence of judges, especially the recognition of the importance of their role as judges, expressed in terms of due respect and adequate financial remuneration. 30. Paragraph 1.b is closely bound up with the reference in Principle I to all decisions concerning the professional life of judges, which obviously includes their status and their remuneration.” 43. The relevant extracts from Chapter 6 of the European Charter on the Statute for Judges, “Remuneration and Social Welfare”, read as follows: “6.1. Judges exercising judicial functions in a professional capacity are entitled to remuneration, the level of which is fixed so as to shield them from pressures aimed at influencing their decisions and more generally their behaviour within their jurisdiction, thereby impairing their independence and impartiality.”","['6', 'P1']","['6-1', 'P1-1']",['P1-1-1'],[],[],[],1
170,001-86364,ENG,POL,CHAMBER,2008,CASE OF FERLA v. POLAND,3,Violation of Art. 8;Non-pecuniary damage - award,David Thór Björgvinsson;Giovanni Bonello;Ján Šikuta;Lech Garlicki;Nicolas Bratza;Päivi Hirvelä,"5. The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Fałkowo, Poland. 6. On 24 December 1998 the applicant and his wife attended a dinner organised by their neighbours. An argument broke out between the applicant and his neighbour. They left the room and began struggling in the kitchen. Subsequently, they stopped the tussle and the applicant returned home. Apparently, a few minutes later, when the neighbour was on his way to a church, the applicant assaulted him and beat him unconscious. 7. On 25 December 1998 the applicant was arrested on charges of aggravated assault and placed in the Gdańsk District Detention Centre (Rejonowy Areszt Śledczy). 8. On the same date the applicant’s wife gave a statement to the police. She stated that she had attended the dinner, but she had not known anything about the struggle in which her husband had taken part, as she had stayed in the room with the other women. She had found out about it only after her husband had been arrested by the police. 9. On 26 December 1998 the applicant’s wife confirmed her previous statement. 10. The applicant’s wife applied for permission to visit the applicant in prison. On an unknown date the Sopot District Prosecutor (Prokurator Rejonowy) refused her request. 11. On 4 February 1999 the applicant applied for permission to be visited by his wife. On 19 February 1999 the Sopot District Prosecutor refused this request. The prosecutor held that on account of the fact that the applicant’s wife had been called as a witness by the prosecution no such permission could be granted. 12. Meanwhile, on 11 February 1999 the applicant’s wife again gave a statement to the police. Having been duly informed of her rights, she refused to testify against her husband in the case. 13. On 18 March 1999 the prosecutor allowed the applicant’s wife to visit the applicant in prison. 14. On 23 March 1999 the applicant’s wife visited him in prison. However, they could communicate during the visit only by internal phone and she was not allowed to bring their four-year old son. 15. On 27 May 1999 the applicant requested the Gdańsk District Court to allow his wife to visit him. On 30 May 1999 he lodged a complaint with the District Court against the decision to refuse his wife permission to visit him. 16. On 23 June 1999 the Gdańsk Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) informed the applicant that he should not be allowed to have any personal contact with his wife as she was a witness in the proceedings against him. However, the court stressed that the applicant could be visited by adults who were not witnesses in his case and by his four-year old son. The court further noted that the next hearing was set for 16 August 1999. If the applicant’s wife testified on that date she would be allowed to visit him in prison. 17. On 29 June 1999 the applicant asked the Regional Court to indicate a person who could accompany his son to the detention centre. The court in reply informed the applicant that he should indicate such a person. As the applicant failed to do so, his son did not visit him in prison. 18. On 8 July 1999 the President of the Regional Court informed the applicant that his wife was not allowed to visit him in the detention centre since she had testified twice in the investigative stage of the proceedings and those testimonies were relevant to the offences with which the applicant had been charged. The date of the hearing in the applicant’s case had been set for 20 May 1999 and his wife ought to have testified on that date. However, a request by the applicant’s lawyer for an expert psychiatrist’s report caused an adjournment of the trial until 16 August 1999. The president further noted that until the applicant’s wife testified in the trial the court had the right to refuse her requests to visit the applicant, in order to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings. 19. The applicant’s wife failed to appear at the hearing held on 16 August 1999 before the Gdańsk Regional Court and in consequence she was fined. 20. The applicant’s wife subsequently applied again for permission to visit him in prison. 21. During the hearing held on 5 November 1999 the applicant’s wife refused to testify in the proceedings against her husband. 22. The applicant submitted that his wife was allowed to visit him in prison before the end of November 1999. 23. On 10 December 1999 the applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to four years’ imprisonment. The court extended the applicant’s detention until the judgment became final. 24. On 24 March 2000 the applicant and his wife were deprived of their parental rights in respect of their son S. F. The child was placed in a care institution. The court held that the applicant was in prison and the mother was a regular abuser of alcohol. The court further pointed out that on 19 March 2000 the mother had left her son unattended in the street, which had considerably endangered her child’s security. 25. On 26 April 2000 the Court of Appeal upheld the applicant’s conviction. 26. Pursuant to Article 217 of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences of 1997 a detainee is allowed to receive visitors, provided that he obtained permission from the investigating prosecutor (at the investigative stage) or from the trial court (once the trial has begun). The relevant extracts from the Recommendation read as follows: “Part II Conditions of imprisonment Contact with the outside world 24.1 Prisoners shall be allowed to communicate as often as possible by letter, telephone or other forms of communication with their families, other persons and representatives of outside organisations and to receive visits from these persons. 24.2 Communication and visits may be subject to restrictions and monitoring necessary for the requirements of continuing criminal investigations, maintenance of good order, safety and security, prevention of criminal offences and protection of victims of crime, but such restrictions, including specific restrictions ordered by a judicial authority, shall nevertheless allow an acceptable minimum level of contact. 24.3 National law shall specify national and international bodies and officials with whom communication by prisoners shall not be restricted. 24.4 The arrangements for visits shall be such as to allow prisoners to maintain and develop family relationships in as normal a manner as possible. 24.5 Prison authorities shall assist prisoners in maintaining adequate contact with the outside world and provide them with the appropriate welfare support to do so. ”",['8'],[],[],[],[],[],1

THE UNITED KINGDOM,1,Violation of Art. 3 (substantive aspect);No violation of Art. 6;Violation of Art. 13;Violation of Art. 34;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient,Giovanni Bonello;Ján Šikuta;Lech Garlicki;Mihai Poalelungi;Nebojša Vučinić;Nicolas Bratza,"9. The facts of the case and the relevant legal framework may be summarised as follows. 10. On 20 March 2003 a coalition of armed forces (the Multinational Force or “MNF”), led by the United States of America with a large force from the United Kingdom and smaller contingents from Australia and Poland, commenced the invasion of Iraq. 11. Major combat operations in Iraq ceased at the beginning of May 2003. The United States of America and the United Kingdom thereafter became occupying powers within the meaning of section III of the Hague Regulations on the Laws and Customs of War on Land (1907) and the Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (Geneva, 1949) (“the Fourth Geneva Convention”). Article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention placed an obligation on the United Kingdom, within the area it occupied, to protect the civilian population against all acts of violence and Articles 41, 42 and 78 gave the United Kingdom the power, inter alia, to intern Iraqi civilians where necessary for imperative reasons of security. 12. The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) was created by the government of the United States of America as a “caretaker administration” until an Iraqi government could be established. It had power, inter alia, to issue legislation. On 13 May 2003 the US Secretary for Defence, Donald Rumsfeld, issued a memorandum formally appointing Ambassador Paul Bremer as Administrator of the CPA with responsibility for the temporary governance of Iraq. The CPA administration was divided into regional areas. CPA South remained under United Kingdom responsibility and control, with a United Kingdom regional coordinator. It covered the southernmost four of Iraq’s eighteen provinces, each having a governorate coordinator. British troops were deployed in the same area. The United Kingdom was represented at CPA headquarters through the office of the United Kingdom Special Representative. Although the United Kingdom Special Representative and his office sought to influence CPA policy and decisions, he had no formal decision-making power within the CPA. All the CPA’s administrative and legislative decisions were taken by Ambassador Bremer. 13. CPA Regulation No. 1 gave the CPA authority to issue binding regulations and orders and memoranda in relation to the interpretation and application of any regulation and order. CPA Order No. 7, dated 9 June 2003, modified the Iraqi Penal Code to remove certain offences and, in section 3(1), suspended the operation of the death penalty in Iraq. CPA Memorandum No. 3 of 18 June 2003 was entitled “Criminal Procedures” and contained, inter alia, the following provisions: “(1) Consistent with the Fourth Geneva Convention, the following standards will apply to all persons who are detained by Coalition Forces solely in relation to allegations of criminal acts and who are not security internees (hereinafter ‘criminal detainees’): (a) Upon the initial induction into a Coalition Force detention centre a criminal detainee shall be apprised of his rights to remain silent and to consult an attorney. (b) A criminal detainee suspected of a felony offence may consult an attorney 72 hours after induction into a Coalition Force detention centre. (c) A criminal detainee shall be promptly informed, in writing, in a language which they understand, of the particulars of the charges preferred against them. (d) A criminal detainee shall be brought before a judicial officer as rapidly as possible and in no instance later than 90 days from the date of induction into a Coalition Force detention centre. (e) Access to detainees shall be granted to official delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). ... (2) Where any criminal detainee held by Coalition Forces is subsequently transferred to an Iraqi court, a failure to comply with these procedures shall not constitute grounds for any legal remedy or negation of process, but any period spent in detention awaiting trial or punishment shall be deducted from any period of imprisonment imposed.” “(1) Consistent with the Fourth Geneva Convention, the following standards will apply to all persons who are detained by Coalition Forces where necessary for imperative reasons of security (hereinafter ‘security internees’): (a) In accordance with Article 78 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Coalition Forces shall, with the least possible delay, afford persons held as security internees the right of appeal against the decision to intern them. (b) The decision to intern a person shall be reviewed not later than six months from the date of induction into an internment facility by a competent body established for the purpose by Coalition Forces. (c) The operation, condition and standards of any internment facility established by Coalition Forces shall be in accordance with section IV of the Fourth Geneva Convention. (d) Access to internees shall be granted to official delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). ... (e) If a person is subsequently determined to be a criminal detainee following tribunal proceedings concerning his or her status, or following the commission of a crime while in internment, the period that person has spent in internment will not count with respect to the period set out in section 6(1)(d) herein. (f) Where any security internee held by Coalition Forces is subsequently transferred to an Iraqi court, a failure to comply with these proceedings shall not constitute grounds for any legal remedy, but may be considered in mitigation in sentence.” 14. The invasion had gone ahead after the abandonment of the efforts by the coalition States to obtain the backing of a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolution (UNSCR). UNSCR 1483 was adopted by the UNSC on 22 May 2003. Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the UNSC called on the coalition of occupying States, in conformity with the United Nations Charter and other relevant international law, to promote the welfare of the Iraqi people and work towards the restoration of conditions of stability and security. The UNSC further requested the Secretary-General to appoint a Special Representative in Iraq: he was to report regularly to the UNSC on his activities under the UNSCR, which were to coordinate the activities of the United Nations and other international agencies engaged in post-conflict processes and humanitarian assistance in a number of specified ways, including the protection of human rights. 15. In July 2003 the Governing Council of Iraq was established, which the CPA was to consult on all matters concerning the temporary governance of Iraq. 16. UNSCR 1511, adopted on 16 October 2003, underscored the temporary nature of the CPA’s role; determined that the Governing Council of Iraq and its ministers were the principal bodies of the Iraqi interim administration which embodied the sovereignty of the State of Iraq during the transitional period until an internationally recognised, representative government was established and assumed the responsibilities of the CPA; called upon the CPA to return governing responsibilities and authorities to the people of Iraq as soon as practicable; and invited the Governing Council of Iraq to produce a timetable and programme for the drafting of a new constitution for Iraq and for the holding of democratic elections under that constitution. It authorised the MNF to take all necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq and provided that the requirements and mission of the MNF would be reviewed within one year of the date of the UNSCR and that in any case the mandate of the MNF was to expire upon the completion of the political process to which the resolution had previously referred. 17. Pursuant to UNSCR 1483 (see paragraph 14 above), provision was made by CPA Order No. 48 of 10 December 2003 for the setting up of an Iraqi Tribunal to try members of the previous Iraqi regime alleged to be responsible for crimes and atrocities. In the Order, the CPA delegated to the interim government the following authority: “The Governing Council is hereby authorised to establish an Iraqi Special Tribunal (the ‘Tribunal’ [subsequently known as the ‘Iraqi High Tribunal’ or ‘IHT’]) to try Iraqi nationals or residents of Iraq accused of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes or violations of certain Iraqi laws, by promulgating a statute, the proposed provisions of which have been discussed extensively between the Governing Council and the CPA ...” 18. On 8 March 2004 the Governing Council of Iraq promulgated the Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period (known as the “Transitional Administrative Law”). This provided a temporary legal framework for the administration of Iraq for the transitional period which was due to commence by 30 June 2004 with the establishment of an interim Iraqi government (“the interim government”) and the dissolution of the CPA. Section 26 of the Transitional Administrative Law made provision for the laws in force in Iraq at the time of that change to continue in effect unless rescinded or amended by the interim government, and specifically for the laws, regulations, orders and directives issued by the CPA to remain in force until rescinded or amended by legislation duly enacted and having the force of law. 19. Further provision for the new regime was made in UNSCR 1546, adopted on 8 June 2004. The UNSCR endorsed “the formation of a sovereign interim government of Iraq ... which will assume full responsibility and authority by 30 June 2004 for governing Iraq” (Article 1) and welcomed “that, also by 30 June 2004, the occupation will end and [the CPA] will cease to exist, and that Iraq will reassert its full sovereignty” (Article 2). It noted that the presence of the MNF was at the request of the incoming interim government (as set out in correspondence between the Iraqi Prime Minister and the US Secretary of State annexed to the resolution) and reaffirmed the authorisation for the MNF to remain in Iraq, with authority to take all necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability there. Provision was again made for the mandate of the MNF to be reviewed within twelve months and to expire upon completion of the political process previously referred to. 20. A revised version of CPA Memorandum No. 3 was issued on 27 June 2004 (“CPA Memorandum No. 3 (Revised)”) which amended the law and procedure in relation to detention. It provided as follows: “(1) This Memorandum implements CPA Order No. 7 by establishing procedures for applying criminal law in Iraq, recognising that effective administration of justice must consider: (a) the continuing involvement of the Multinational Force (MNF) in providing critical support to some aspects of the administration of justice; (b) the need to transition from this support; (c) the need to modify aspects of Iraqi law that violate fundamental standards of human rights; (d) the ongoing process of security internee management in accordance with the relevant and appropriate standards set out in the Fourth Geneva Convention which shall be applied by the MNF as a matter of policy in accordance with its mandate. ...” “(1) A national contingent of the MNF shall have the right to apprehend persons who are suspected of having committed criminal acts and are not considered security internees (hereinafter ‘criminal detainees’) who shall be handed over to Iraqi authorities as soon as reasonably practicable. A national contingent of the MNF may retain criminal detainees in facilities that it maintains at the request of the appropriate Iraqi authorities based on security or capacity considerations. Where such criminal detainees are retained in the detention facilities of a national contingent of the MNF the following standards will apply: (a) Upon the initial induction into the detention centre a criminal detainee shall be apprised of his rights to remain silent and to consult an attorney by the authority serving an arrest warrant. (b) A criminal detainee suspected of a felony offence may consult an attorney 72 hours after induction into the detention centre. (c) A criminal detainee shall be promptly informed, in writing, in a language which they understand, of the particulars of the charges preferred against them by the authority serving an arrest warrant. (d) A criminal detainee shall be brought before a judicial officer as rapidly as possible and in no instance later than 90 days from the date of induction into the detention centre. (e) Access to detainees shall be granted to the Iraqi Prisons and Detainee Ombudsman (hereinafter ‘the Ombudsman’). ... (f) Access to detainees shall be granted to official delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). ... (2) Where any criminal detainee held by a national contingent of the MNF is subsequently transferred to an Iraqi court, a failure to comply with these procedures shall not constitute grounds for any legal remedy or negation of process, but any period spent in detention awaiting trial or punishment shall be deducted from any period of imprisonment imposed.” “(1) Any person who is detained by a national contingent of the MNF for imperative reasons of security in accordance with the mandate set out in UNSCR 1546 (hereinafter ‘security internees’) shall, if he is held for a period longer than 72 hours, be entitled to have a review of the decision to intern him. (2) The review must take place with the least possible delay and in any case must be held no later than 7 days after the date of induction into an internment facility. (3) Further reviews of the continued detention of any security internee shall be conducted on a regular basis but in any case not later than six months from the date of induction into an internment facility. (4) The operation, condition and standards of any internment facility established by the MNF shall be in accordance with section IV of the Fourth Geneva Convention. (5) Security internees who are placed in internment after 30 June 2004, must in all cases only be held for so long as the imperative reasons of security in relation to the internee exist and in any case must be either released from internment or transferred to the Iraqi criminal jurisdiction not later than 18 months from the date of induction into an MNF internment facility. Any person under the age of 18 interned at any time shall in all cases be released not later than 12 months after the initial date of internment. ... (9) If a person is subsequently determined to be a criminal detainee following a review of his or her status, or following the commission of a crime while in internment, the period that person has spent in internment will not count with respect to the period set out in section 5(2) herein ...” 21. CPA Order No. 17 (Revised), dated 27 June 2004, dealt with the status of MNF personnel in Iraq. Section 2 established the immunity from Iraqi legal process of MNF personnel, as follows: “(1) Unless provided otherwise herein, the MNF, the CPA, Foreign Liaison Missions, their Personnel, property, funds and assets, and all International Consultants shall be immune from Iraqi legal process. (2) All MNF, CPA and Foreign Liaison Mission Personnel, and International Consultants shall respect the Iraqi laws relevant to those Personnel and Consultants in Iraq including the Regulations, Orders, Memoranda and Public Notices issued by the Administrator of the CPA. (3) All MNF, CPA and Foreign Liaison Mission Personnel, and International Consultants shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of their Sending States. They shall be immune from any form of arrest or detention other than by persons acting on behalf of their Sending States, except that nothing in this provision shall prohibit MNF Personnel from preventing acts of serious misconduct by the above-mentioned Personnel or Consultants, or otherwise temporarily detaining any such Personnel or Consultants who pose a risk of injury to themselves or others, pending expeditious turnover to the appropriate authorities of the Sending State. In all such circumstances, the appropriate senior representative of the detained person’s Sending State in Iraq shall be notified immediately. (4) The Sending States of MNF Personnel shall have the right to exercise within Iraq any criminal and disciplinary jurisdiction conferred on them by the law of that Sending State over all persons subject to the military law of that Sending State. ...” Section 9(1) of the Order provided for the inviolability of MNF facilities, as follows: “The MNF may use without cost such areas for headquarters, camps or other premises as may be necessary for the conduct of the operational and administrative activities of the MNF. All premises currently used by the MNF shall continue to be used by it without hindrance for the duration of this Order, unless other mutually agreed arrangements are entered into between the MNF and the Government. While any areas on which such headquarters, camps or other premises are located remain Iraqi territory, they shall be inviolable and subject to the exclusive control and authority of the MNF, including with respect to entry and exit of all personnel. The MNF shall be guaranteed unimpeded access to such MNF premises. Where MNF Personnel are co-located with military personnel of Iraq, permanent, direct and immediate access for the MNF to those premises shall be guaranteed.” 22. On 28 June 2004 the occupation came to an end when full authority was transferred from the CPA to the interim government and the CPA ceased to exist. Subsequently the MNF, including the British forces forming part of it, remained in Iraq pursuant to requests by the Iraqi government and authorisations from the UNSC. In accordance with section 26 of the Transitional Administrative Law (see paragraph 18 above), the CPA Memorandum and Order set out above remained in force. 23. In August 2004 the Iraqi National Assembly reintroduced the death penalty to the Iraqi Penal Code in respect of certain violent crimes, including murder and certain war crimes. 24. On 9 October 2004 the Iraqi National Assembly established the Iraqi High Tribunal (IHT). The IHT was given jurisdiction over a list of offences, including war crimes, committed in Iraq or elsewhere during the period 17 July 1968 to 1 May 2003. Article 19 of its Statute provided for a number of fair trial guarantees for accused persons. Article 24 provided that the IHT should impose the penalties prescribed by the Iraqi Penal Code. 25. On 8 November 2004 a memorandum of understanding (MOU) regarding criminal suspects was entered into between the United Kingdom contingent of the MNF and the Ministries of Justice and of the Interior of Iraq (collectively referred to as “the Participants”). The preamble to the MOU recited the authority of the United Kingdom contingent of the MNF, “in accordance with the mandate conferred by UNSCR 1546”, to intern persons for imperative reasons of security, and the power of national contingents of the MNF, “in accordance with CPA Memorandum No. 3 (Revised)”, to apprehend persons who were suspected of committing criminal acts. It also stated that “[w]hereas Iraq is developing its own custodial capacity with the aim of being able to confine all criminal suspects in its own facilities, it may, in the meantime, request [the United Kingdom contingent of the MNF] to confine persons who are suspected of having committed criminal acts in safe and secure detention facilities, subject to security and capacity considerations”. The substantive provisions of the MOU included the following: “This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) sets out the authorities and responsibilities in relation to criminal suspects. For the purpose of this MOU, ‘criminal suspects’ are: ... (c) individuals who are suspected of having committed criminal acts who are held at the request of the Iraqi authorities.” “(1) The interim Iraqi government (and any successor) has legal authority over all criminal suspects who have been ordered to stand trial and who are waiting trial in the physical custody of [the United Kingdom contingent of the MNF] in accordance with the terms of this Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). (2) The [United Kingdom contingent of the MNF] has a discretion whether to accept any particular criminal suspect into its physical custody and whether to continue to provide custody for a suspect who is in its physical custody at the time this MOU comes into operation or who, at any time in the future, comes into its custody. ...” “(1) In relation to any criminal suspect being held in the physical custody of the [United Kingdom contingent of the MNF], the Ministry of Justice will: (a) provide [the United Kingdom contingent of the MNF] with a written request for his delivery up to attend a court appearance or for any other purpose connected with the criminal process and will give as much advance notice of the proposed date when the presence of the suspect is required as is practicable; ... (d) ensure that any criminal proceedings commenced against a criminal suspect progress without undue delay. (2) In relation to any criminal suspect being held in the physical custody of [the United Kingdom contingent of the MNF], [the United Kingdom contingent of the MNF]: (a) will provide humane treatment and will not subject any criminal suspect to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; ... (c) will take appropriate steps to ensure that the conditions of custody meet the standards set out in CPA Memoranda Nos. 2 and 3; ... (3) In relation to any criminal suspect apprehended by [the United Kingdom contingent of the MNF] and handed over to the Iraqi authorities as soon as reasonably practicable, in accordance with section 5 of the CPA Memorandum No. 3 (Revised), the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of the Interior, as the case may be: (a) will provide humane treatment and will not subject any criminal suspect to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; and (b) will hold the criminal suspect in accordance with Iraqi law. (4) In relation to any criminal suspect transferred to the Ministry of the Interior or the Ministry of Justice by [the United Kingdom contingent of the MNF] from its detention facilities, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of the Interior, as the case may be, will: (a) inform [the United Kingdom contingent of the MNF] before releasing any individual and will comply with any request by [the United Kingdom contingent of the MNF] that [the United Kingdom contingent of the MNF] should reassume custody if, (i) the individual is wanted for prosecution by any State that has contributed forces to the MNF for breaches of the laws and customs of war, or (ii) the internment of the individual is necessary for imperative reasons of security, in which case [the United Kingdom contingent of the MNF] will assume custody of that individual after consultation between the Participants to reach an agreed solution. ... (c) provide an assurance that during any temporary periods when a suspect is in the hands of the Iraqi authorities whether at the [the United Kingdom contingent of the MNF]’s detention facility or elsewhere and at any time following the transfer of a suspect to Iraqi facilities, (i) the suspect will be treated humanely and will not be subject to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; and (ii) the requirements of CPA Orders with respect to cooperation with and reasonable access to be provided to the Iraqi Ombudsman for Penal and Detention Matters and the International Committee of the Red Cross will be adhered to. (5) If [the United Kingdom contingent of the MNF] decides that it is no longer prepared to provide custody facilities for a particular suspect, it shall give notice of this decision to the Ministry of Justice as soon as possible to enable the Ministry of Justice to make other arrangements for the custody of that suspect if it so wishes. The Ministry of Justice will then notify [the United Kingdom contingent of the MNF] of the arrangements it has made or alternatively will indicate that the suspect should be released. [The United Kingdom contingent of the MNF] will then use its best endeavours to enable any such alternative arrangements to be put in place.” 26. The last relevant UNSCR, 1790 of 18 December 2007, extended the MNF’s mandate to remain, for the last time, until 31 December 2008. Annexed to the Resolution was a letter from the Iraqi Prime Minister which stated, inter alia: “The government of Iraq requests that the Security Council should consider extending the mandate of MNF-1 in the light of Iraq’s achievements over the past few years, namely, the strengthened capacity of its Army and security forces and its significant successes in the security, political and economic spheres. A review of the role and authority of MNF-1 will thus be required in order to strike a balance between, on the one hand, the need to extend, one last time, the mandate of the force and, on the other hand, progress made by Iraq in the area of security. In this regard, it is important for Iraq to be treated as an independent and fully sovereign State and, in seeking the aforementioned balance, the following objectives should be highlighted: ... 4. The government of Iraq will be responsible for arrest, detention and imprisonment tasks. When those tasks are carried out by MNF-1, there will be maximum levels of coordination, cooperation and understanding with the government of Iraq.” 27. In July 2004 the United Kingdom Government made representations to the Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister, Barham Saleh, and the Iraqi Minister of Human Rights that Iraq should not adopt the death penalty Order (which restored the death penalty for certain specified offences) of the interim Iraqi government. 28. Further representations were considered before the MOU was signed in November 2004. However, that MOU was intended to set out the authorities and responsibilities of the respective parties. Consequently, primarily as a result of the reintroduction by Iraq of the death penalty for certain specified offences, the judgment was made that Iraq would not respond favourably to requests that the MOU reverse the effect of the recently adopted Iraqi Order and prohibit the imposition or use of the death penalty. The judgment was made that it was better to pursue the United Kingdom’s opposition to the imposition and use of the death penalty by other means. 29. Further representations were made on this issue. During the United Kingdom’s Presidency of the European Union in the second half of 2005, the Government made representations to the Iraqi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs advocating the abolition of the death penalty. 30. The Government supported a démarche against the use of the death penalty issued by the Austrian Presidency to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in April 2006. 31. On 15 October 2006 the British ambassador made representations to the Iraqi President, Jalal Talibani, that he should not sign a death warrant in the event that a death penalty was passed on those involved in the abduction of Phillip Sands and Norman Kember. 32. The Prime Minister’s Special Envoy for Human Rights in Iraq wrote to the President of Iraq on 28 February 2007 to request a stay of execution for four Iraqi women sentenced to death. The opposition to the imposition or use of the death penalty under any circumstances was reiterated. 33. In March 2007 the Government supported a démarche opposing the use of the death penalty following the imposition of the death penalty on Taha Yassin Ramadan. 34. The Government strongly supported the resolutions adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in December 2007 (A/Res/62/149) and in November 2008 (A/Res/63/168), calling upon all States that maintain the death penalty to establish a moratorium on executions with a view to abolition. 35. In response to recent executions in Iraq, the Government joined other European member States in a démarche against the death penalty delivered on 8 March 2009 and reissued on 13 April 2009 by the Czech European Union Presidency to Iraqi Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi and to the Head of the Iraqi Prime Minister’s Office. 36. The Iraqi Council of Ministers Resolution 439/2008, passed on 16 December 2008, stated as follows: “The forces of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland are permitted to stay in Iraq to complete the tasks they are given, and for these tasks to end no later than the 31st of May 2009 and to fully withdraw from Iraq no later than the 31st of July 2009. ...” “(a) Members of the forces referred to in Articles 1 and 2 of the Law and members of the Ministries of Defence of the countries to which those aforementioned forces belong, who are working with those forces, shall be subject to the jurisdiction of Iraq with the exception of crimes committed by them while on duty which are not committed with intent or do not arise from gross negligence, and with the exception of those committed by them inside agreed facilities and military installations used by them, in which case they shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the country to which they belong. ... (c) An accused member of the forces or the Ministry of Defence of the countries referred to in Articles 1 and 2 of this Law, shall be held in the custody of the authorities of the country to which the accused belongs. These authorities should make available the accused to the Iraqi authorities for the purposes of investigation and trial. ...” “The task and activities of the forces referred to in Articles 1 and 2 of this Law and their facilities and military installations during their temporary presence in Iraq are to be specified by the government of Iraq with the agreement of the governments and parties concerned, providing that these troops do not carry out any operations or military activities within Iraqi land, airspace and waters without prior approval from the government of Iraq.” 39. The applicants are Sunni Muslims from southern Iraq. The first applicant joined the Ba’ath Party in 1969, aged 17. In 1996 he became the Branch Member of the Al-Zubair branch of the Ba’ath Party (reporting to the second applicant, the General Secretary of the Al-Zubair branch). The second applicant joined the Ba’ath Party in 1968, aged 18. In February 2001 he became the General Secretary of the Al-Zubair branch, the highest rank in the province of Al-Zubair. 40. On or around 23 March 2003, two British servicemen, Staff Sergeant Cullingworth and Sapper Allsopp, were ambushed in Al-Zubair, southern Iraq, by Iraqi militia forces. Their bodies were found on 10 April 2003 buried in the grounds of a government building in Al-Zubair. They were found to have been killed by multiple gunshot wounds. 41. British forces in Basra arrested the first applicant on 30 April 2003 and the second applicant on 21 November 2003. They were initially detained at a facility run by American forces known as “Camp Bucca”. On 15 December 2003 they were transferred to a British-run facility in Iraq known as the “Divisional Temporary Detention Facility”. On 20 April 2007 they were transferred to another British detention facility in Iraq, the “Divisional Internment Facility”, where they remained until 31 December 2008. 42. The applicants were initially classified as “security internees”. Their notices of internment stated that they were suspected of being senior members of the Ba’ath Party under the former regime and of orchestrating anti-MNF violence by former regime elements, and that it was believed that if they were released they would represent an imperative threat to security. 43. Between March 2003 and October 2004 the Special Investigations Branch of the United Kingdom’s Royal Military Police conducted an investigation into the deaths of Staff Sergeant Cullingworth and Sapper Allsopp and found evidence that the applicants were part of a group who slapped and rifle-butted the soldiers, at a time when they were prisoners of war; entered into an agreement to kill them; and were among those seen to have shot at them. 44. The minutes of the meetings of the Divisional Internment Review Committee (DIRC) referring to the applicants read as follows: “UK SofS [Secretary of State] is concerned about the death penalty and the [Iraqi] prosecutor is not sure that there is a realistic prospect of conviction as the offence happened too close to the actual hostilities. Negotiations are continuing at a high level.” “Referred to SofS over proposed transfer to CCCI [Central Criminal Court of Iraq] because the death penalty might be imposed. There has now been a case conference between prosecutor, MoJ [Iraqi Ministry of Justice] and FCO legal [United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Legal Advisers]. CCCI is still considering whether to take the case. Comd [Commander] Legal will chase SofS and progress from CCCI.” “A case conference was held in Baghdad on 24 Sep 04. This has convinced the prosecutors that there is a good case. However they have cold feet about prosecuting it as the matter is so high profile. Legal Branch will be considering with SBMR-I [Senior British Military Representative – Iraq] POLAD [Political Adviser] how to proceed; we may have to bring a prosecutor or assistant out from UK.” “S03 Legal [a military legal officer] has asked ALS [Army Legal Service] Brig Prosecutions to look into establishing a new post in Baghdad for an ALS officer to assist with the prosecution of this case. The requirements will be discussed between S03 Legal and the US JAG [Judge Advocate General] liaison team to the CCCI when S03 Legal attends Baghdad on Thursday 21 Oct 04.” “SIB [Royal Military Police Special Investigation Branch] have now completed final interviews, which have not progressed the case in any material way. Discussions between Legal Branch, SBMR-I POLAD and DALS [Directorate of Army Legal Services] are ongoing reference the bid for an ALS officer/civilian lawyer to assist with the prosecution of this case. S03 Legal [British military legal officer, Capt HRB Mynors] will go to Baghdad from 03 to 05 Nov 04 to begin to assess the paperwork and decide what further work is needed and how long it will take, in order better to decide on the requirement for the assistant prosecutor.” “S03 Legal visited Baghdad to consider the requirements for a CCCI LO [Iraqi Central Criminal Court Legal Officer]. The [deleted] Case is almost ready to take to court but the EOD [explosive ordinance disposal] case ... will need a significant amount of work. The decision over who will take on these cases has been staffed back to Brig ALS Advisory. Barry Burton (SBMR-I POLAD) thinks it should be an ALS officer, the ALS hierarchy are not sure. Due to the sensitivity of these cases it will probably be decided at ministerial level.” “The CCCI LO issue over who is to liaise with the CCCI over the prosecution of the EOD murder case ... is still being considered in the UK. Comd Legal will be chasing Brig ALS Advisory today. HQ DALS, MOD [Ministry of Defence] and FCO are discussing who will take this case forward at the CCCI. The US LOs are not prepared to take the case on and have asked for a UK LO. It is not yet clear who this will be. Once it has been decided who will lead on the case, SIB will need to make further enquiries.” “APA [the Army Prosecuting Authority] has informed Legal Branch that Major Richard Allen ALS has been designated as the LO to the CCCI. Date of commencement tbc [to be confirmed]. This will affect internees 088888 and 090537 [the applicants] as they may eventually be transferred to the CCCI if it is decided to prosecute them.” “The issue is over who will conduct the case. It has been agreed that Major Richard Allen ALS will be sent to liaise with the CCCI in Baghdad wef [with effect from] Jan 05 to progress prosecutions. However it now appears that there is confusion over whether he will be allowed to progress this particular case (although others will be OK). S03 Legal will chase ALS to find out what will be decided about progress on this case. This case needs more investigations and a decision clarifying how many accused/what offences before it can be passed to the investigative magistrate of the CCCI and a remand order can be sought.” “The ALS CCCI LO is currently examining all the case papers and will produce a case analysis as to potential prosecution of all individuals implicated, including this internee. The case analysis is expected to be available in fourteen days. It will then be circulated within the MOD/FCO and other interested parties in order for a decision as to the way forward to be made, particularly given the potential death penalty issue. Upon distribution of the case analysis from the ALS CCCI LO, pressure should be maintained on MOD/FCO to identify the way forward given the potential death penalty difficulties. POLAD to action.” “The ALS CCCI LO has now considered all the case papers and prepared a case analysis as to the strength and viability of a potential prosecution of all individuals implicated, including this internee. Pursuant to a meeting with Comd Legal at HQ MND(SE) [Multinational Division (South-East) (Iraq)] on 09 Mar 05, it has been assessed that there exists sufficient evidence to prosecute the case against this internee. The case analysis is now with the MOD/FCO in London, where a meeting is expected to take place between PJHQ [Permanent Joint Head Quarters], the MOD and the FCO within the next fourteen days focusing on the legal ramifications surrounding the transfer of the case to the CCCI in Baghdad for prosecution, particularly given the potential death penalty issue. Pressure should be maintained on the MOD/FCO to expedite the way forward in providing guidance on the potential death penalty difficulties now that the case analysis is complete and the early phases of the operation are underway. POLAD to action.” “The case analysis is now with the MOD/FCO in London and governmental discussions are ongoing (although currently stalled) on the legal ramifications surround [sic] the transfer of the case to the CCCI in Baghdad for prosecution, particularly given the possible application of the death penalty. Pressure must continue to be maintained on the MOD/FCO to expedite the way forward now that the case analysis is with the Government for consideration. In particular, guidance must be sought on the safeguards that can be imposed before transferring the case to the CCCI, especially in light of the potential death penalty difficulties. POLAD to action.” [Having noted that the case analysis was still with the MOD/FCO in London] “Comd Legal’s hope is this internee’s case, together with 090537, will be submitted before the CCCI in Baghdad during the week commencing 5 Dec 05 with the ultimate aim these internees be transferred out of the DTDF [Divisional Temporary Detention Facility] and handed over into the ICJS [Iraqi Criminal Justice System]. Comd Legal was of the view it would be easier to secure witness evidence in any CCCI case owing to the fact this internee, together with 0888888, were senior Ba’athists. Issues may arise over the detention of potential co-accused. Again, however it is assessed that the detention of such individuals who are still alive may prove less problematic than many other detention questions.” “This internee (together with ... Al-Saadoon ...) is, as a result of extensive investigation by the Special Investigative Branch of the Royal Military Police, believed to be responsible for the deaths (on or about 23 March 2003) of Staff Sergeant Cullingworth and Sergeant Allsopp, both of the British Army. The investigation has resulted in eye witness testimony that alleges this accused (who was a civilian and head of the Az Zuabyr Ba’ath Party) was one of a group of people who slapped and rifle-butted the two above-named soldiers at a time when they were prisoners of war and were, therefore, protected persons under the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War dated 12 August 1949. This internee was a party to an agreement to kill the soldiers and was seen to be one of those who shot the two soldiers. The police investigation is now complete and the United Kingdom intends to lodge the evidence with the Iraqi High Tribunal in the near future.” 45. On 16 December 2005 the cases against the applicants concerning the deaths of Staff Sergeant Cullingworth and Sapper Allsopp were formally referred by the United Kingdom contingent of the MNF to the Chief Investigative Judge of the Central Criminal Court of Iraq. The cases were subsequently transferred to the Basra Criminal Court and on 12 April 2006 a British officer attended that court to make a statement of complaint in respect of the killing of the two soldiers. 46. On 18 May 2006 the applicants appeared before the Special Investigative Panel of the Basra Criminal Court to give evidence in response to the complaint. The court issued arrest warrants under the Iraqi Penal Code and made an order authorising the applicants’ continued detention by the United Kingdom contingent of the MNF. On 21 May 2006 the United Kingdom authorities decided to reclassify the applicants from “security internees” to “criminal detainees”. 47. After an initial investigation, the Basra Criminal Court decided that, since the alleged offences constituted war crimes, the applicants’ cases should be transferred to the IHT (see paragraph 24 above) and the IHT accepted that it had jurisdiction. The applicants twice appealed against the decision to transfer their cases to the IHT but the Basra Criminal Court in its appellate capacity dismissed the first appeal on 27 November 2006 and the Federal Appeal Court in Basra dismissed the second appeal on 16 May 2007. 48. The IHT first requested that the applicants be transferred into its custody on 27 December 2007 and repeated that request on several occasions until May 2008. When asked by the English Court of Appeal to clarify why the applicants were not transferred by the United Kingdom contingent of the MNF to the IHT between December 2007 and May 2008, counsel for the Government explained: “We took the view that there was then a genuine issue, because there had been no decision by any court as to whether or not there was the international-law obligation that we say existed or any decision on the question of jurisdiction. That was resolved by the Divisional Court, and thereafter we have said it is not now possible for us to give that undertaking [not to transfer them].” 49. On 12 June 2008 the applicants issued judicial review proceedings in England challenging, inter alia, the legality of their proposed transfer. Shortly after proceedings were issued, the Government provided an undertaking that it would not transfer the applicants pending the determination of their claim before the English courts. 50. Five days later, on 17 June 2008, Abda Sharif (Legal Adviser at the British embassy in Baghdad) met with the President of the IHT, President Aref, to reiterate the United Kingdom’s strong opposition to the death penalty. During this discussion President Aref invited letters from the victims’ families and from the British embassy in Baghdad opposing the imposition of the death penalty in this case, as that would be a factor which would be taken into account by the court. President Aref also indicated that it would be helpful if the British embassy waived its right to civil compensation. 51. On 29 June 2008 the Second Secretary Human Rights Officer at the British embassy in Baghdad, Mr Gordon Ross, met with President Aref to further discuss the situation and what would be the effect if only one of the families of the two victims were to write to seek clemency. The President indicated that if only one of the two families sought clemency, the letter from one family would be taken into account by the court and the fact that the other family had not done so would not significantly affect matters. 52. The Government were able to contact one of the families of the two victims. That family agreed to support a plea for clemency and the non-imposition of the death penalty in the event that the applicants were convicted of a capital offence. 53. The British embassy in Baghdad also wrote seeking the non-imposition of the death penalty. It also waived any right to civil compensation. 54. Abda Sharif held a further meeting with President Aref on 18 August 2008 and presented him with the letter from the British embassy, outlining the United Kingdom’s opposition to the imposition of the death penalty. The letter was signed by the British ambassador, Christopher Prentice, and waived the right to compensation. This was accompanied by a letter dated 6 August 2008 from one of the families seeking clemency, with an Arabic translation. 55. The hearing before the Divisional Court took place on 18 to 20 November 2008. Claims by the applicants concerning the legality of their detention by British forces were adjourned. 56. At the hearing the court expressed its concerns about what would happen to the applicants after the expiry of the United Nations mandate on 31 December 2008. The Government put before the court evidence about the intergovernmental negotiations between the United Kingdom and Iraq that were then continuing as to whether and pursuant to what terms British forces would be permitted to remain in Iraq post-31 December 2008. This included the following statement of Mr Watkins, one of the leaders of the United Kingdom’s negotiating team: “... I recognised that, if possible, it would be desirable for UK forces to be in a position to continue to hold the claimants for a period of time whilst this litigation is resolved. I therefore considered with colleagues whether it would be appropriate to raise this issue with the Iraqi negotiating team. I cannot comment in detail on sensitive inter-governmental negotiations, but the judgment was made that to introduce the issue of UK forces continuing to hold detainees, whether generally or specifically in relation to these two claimants, risked adversely affecting the conduct and outcome of these important and urgent negotiations. Furthermore, the judgment was made that raising the issue would not in any event have resulted in any agreement with the Iraqi authorities whereby the claimants remained in the custody of the British forces in Iraq, still less that they would agree to the removal of the claimants from Iraq. Given the fact that the Iraqis are seeking the transfer of detainees from the US to Iraq and the fact that these two claimants are Iraqi nationals accused of crimes within Iraq and that the Iraqi courts have repeatedly requested the transfer of these two claimants in order to complete investigations and if appropriate try them, there was no realistic prospect of Iraq agreeing to allow them to remain within the custody of the UK. To have raised the issue would therefore have resulted in my judgment in no change in relation to the position of the claimants, but would have risked adversely affecting the conduct and outcome of the negotiations with the government of Iraq. ... I have considered whether there may be any other means whereby UK forces could continue to hold the claimants for a period of time beyond the end of this year pending the outcome of this litigation. Conceivably, we might ask the government of Iraq to submit draft legislation to the CoR [Council of Representatives] specifically to permit the UK to hold the claimants indefinitely or pending the outcome of this litigation. Given the facts set out in the previous paragraph, I consider that there is no reasonable prospect that the government of Iraq would accede to such a request. Furthermore, the process of drafting and passing such legislation would extend beyond the end of this year. And even raising the issue would in my considered opinion risk adversely affecting the passage of the legislation and finalising of the inter-governmental arrangement. There is no likelihood in my view of the UK being able to secure any agreement from the Iraqi authorities that we may continue to hold the claimants either indefinitely or pending the outcome of this litigation.” 57. Judgment was delivered on 19 December 2008. The Divisional Court noted that the applicants had been subject to the jurisdiction and legal authority of the Iraqi courts since no later than 18 May 2006 (see paragraph 46 above). CPA Memorandum No. 3 (Revised) (see paragraph 20 above), which was the Iraqi law in force at the time, required the British forces to hand over “criminal detainees” to the Iraqi authorities as soon as practicable. This requirement was also reflected in the United Kingdom-Iraq MOU of 8 November 2004 (see paragraph 25 above). Nonetheless, the Divisional Court rejected the Government’s argument that the actions of the United Kingdom in respect of the applicants were attributable to the Iraqi authorities: the British forces were lawfully present in Iraq, pursuant to a United Nations mandate, as part of the MNF subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United Kingdom and independent of the Iraqi State. The British forces had physical custody and control of the applicants and had it in their power to refuse to transfer them to the custody of the IHT, even if to act in such a way would be contrary to the United Kingdom’s international-law obligations. The applicants therefore fell within the United Kingdom’s jurisdiction for the purposes of Article 1 of the Convention and the Human Rights Act 1998. 58. The Divisional Court then considered whether the applicants could rely on the principle against refoulement in Soering v. the United Kingdom, (7 July 1989, Series A no. 161). It rejected the Government’s argument that the Soering principle could apply only to transfers across territorial boundaries, but it considered itself bound by the Court of Appeal’s judgment in R(B) v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ([2004] EWCA Civ 1344: see paragraph 94 below), which held that where a fugitive was within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom but on the territory of another sovereign State (for example, within an embassy or consulate), the United Kingdom was under an international-law obligation to surrender him unless there was clear evidence that the receiving State intended to subject him to treatment so harsh as to constitute a crime against humanity. 59. The Divisional Court considered expert evidence relating to the fairness of proceedings before the IHT. It found no cogent evidence to support the applicants’ claims that detainees held by the Iraqi authorities were subjected to torture to extract confessions and that evidence obtained by torture would be used against them. It found that although, during the first two trials before the IHT in which Saddam Hussein was one of the defendants (the Dujayl and Anfal trials), there had been a number of fatal attacks on IHT staff and defence lawyers, the situation had improved and no lawyers, witnesses or IHT staff members had been kidnapped or killed in 2008. It did not, therefore, consider that IHT staff and counsel would be so concerned about their safety as to prevent the applicants from having a fair trial and it found that adequate security measures were taken to protect witnesses. There had been no permanent replacements of judges in current trials and there was not a sufficient risk of replacement of the judiciary to operate as a factor prejudicing the possibility of the applicants’ receiving a fair trial. The court noted examples of concerns expressed by third parties relating to the independence of the IHT, but observed that these related to events during the Dujayl and Anfal trials in early 2007, with no more recent examples of such concerns. Taking everything together, it was satisfied that the IHT was sufficiently independent to meet the requirements of a fair trial. There was no real risk of defence counsel being prevented from doing a proper job for the applicants in the event of a trial. The IHT Statute and its rules had been modelled on the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda and the International Criminal Court. The protection afforded to defendants included the presumption of innocence; the right to be informed of charges; the right to defence counsel; the right to be tried without undue delay; the right to be present during trial; the right to examine or confront witnesses; the privilege against self-incrimination; the right not to have silence taken into account in determining guilt; the right of disclosure of exculpatory evidence and witness statements; the exclusion of coerced evidence; the right to ensure that interrogations are videotaped; the right to pose questions directly to the witness; and the right to appellate review. The Divisional Court concluded with regard to the risk of a breach of Article 6 of the Convention: “The overall picture which emerges is that, although initially there were deeply unsatisfactory aspects of the IHT and trial environment, which cast doubt on the ability to provide defendants with a fair trial at that time, there have been many significant improvements since then. ... To date the claimants have appeared before the Iraqi courts and have denied the allegations made against them; and there can be no complaint about the way in which the courts have dealt with them. As to the future, looking at the various points individually and cumulatively, the evidence before us falls a long way short of establishing substantial grounds for believing there to be a real risk that a trial of the claimants would involve a flagrant breach of the principles guaranteed by Article 6. Thus, even if the Convention were to apply in the normal way, we would reject the claim that transfer of the claimants into the custody of the IHT would be contrary to Article 6.” 60. Next, the Divisional Court considered the evidence relating to the likelihood that the applicants would be subjected to the death penalty. It concluded: “Taking the evidence as a whole, we are satisfied that substantial grounds have been shown for believing there to be a real risk of the claimants being condemned to the death penalty and executed, contrary to Protocol No. 13, if they are transferred into the custody of the IHT. In particular: (a) the penalties for the offences with which the applicants are charged include the death penalty; (b) there is clear evidence that persons convicted of such offences are liable in practice to be sentenced to death; (c) the matters relied on as mitigating against the imposition of the death penalty are not sufficiently cogent or certain to negative the real risk; (d) in spite of the efforts made on behalf of the Secretary of State, no assurance has been given that the death penalty will not be imposed in this case; and (e) in any event, even if President Aref [the President of the IHT] had given such an assurance, we are not satisfied it would necessarily be effective because he does not have the authority to bind the appeal chamber which would automatically have to consider the appropriate sentence, whatever decision the trial chamber had reached.” However, the court found that although the death penalty was prohibited by the Convention, it was not yet contrary to internationally accepted norms, at least where it was imposed for serious crimes following conviction at a trial that met minimum standards of fairness. It followed that “however repugnant the death penalty may be within our domestic legal system and under the Convention, its imposition would not be contrary to international law” and the risk that the applicants might be executed did not therefore operate to relieve the United Kingdom of its public international-law obligation to transfer them to the custody of the IHT. 61. The Divisional Court next examined the issues under Article 3 of the Convention. It found that the IHT had requested that, prior to trial, the applicants should be detained in Compound 4 of Rusafa Prison, which was run by the Iraqi Ministry of Justice; if the applicants were convicted and sentenced to over ten years of imprisonment, they would be sent to Fort Suse Prison, also run by the Ministry of Justice. The court referred to a report by the Provost Marshall, the British army officer responsible for conducting inspections of British overseas military detention facilities, who had inspected Rusafa Prison in April 2008 and found that Compound 4 “satisfied the requirements [of the Fourth Geneva Convention]” in respect of the applicants, providing “relative segregation, protection from elements and reasonable living conditions”. Although the Provost Marshall’s inspectors had received complaints from some detainees about the lack of visits and the quality of the food, no one had complained of mistreatment. The Divisional Court also referred to an inspection report by the United States International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Programme on Compounds 1 to 6A at Rusafa Prison, which found no indication that detainees were subjected to intentional or overt acts of mistreatment. Conditions at Compound 4 were found to comply with basic human rights standards; detainees were allowed regular visits from legal representatives and relatives; force was used only as a last resort when necessary to prevent prisoners from harming themselves or others; corporal punishment was forbidden and the prisoners interviewed stated that they had never known it to be used; and there was a robust system for the reporting of any mistreatment. In addition, the court had reference to the fact that, in accordance with paragraph 4(c) of section 3 of the MOU of 8 November 2004 (see paragraph 25 above), the Iraqi authorities had provided an assurance that, following transfer to Iraqi facilities, the applicants would be treated humanely. Although the applicants had adduced expert evidence concerning the conditions at Rusafa Prison, this evidence did not establish any instances of actual mistreatment of prisoners. The evidence relating to Fort Suse Prison did not indicate that, if detained there, the applicants would be at risk of ill-treatment. The court therefore concluded that the evidence fell well short of establishing substantial grounds for believing that the applicants would face a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention if transferred into the custody of the IHT. 62. The Divisional Court concluded that the proposed transfer would be lawful and it dismissed the claim for judicial review, but added: R(B) v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, as we have understood the judgment of the Court of Appeal in that case. ...” 63. The Divisional Court granted the applicants leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal and, on 19 December 2008, granted an interim injunction prohibiting their transfer until 4 p.m. on 22 December 2008 to allow an application for interim relief to be made to the Court of Appeal. 64. The applicants appealed against the Divisional Court’s judgment, principally on the grounds that (1) the court had erred in concluding that there was a relevant public international-law context which could have the effect of modifying the principle in Soering (cited above); (2) even if the court had applied the right test, it had been wrong to hold that the death penalty and execution were not contrary to internationally accepted norms; (3) Article 3 of the Convention and international law prevented transfer in circumstances where substantial grounds had been shown for believing there to be a real risk of the applicants being condemned to death by hanging; (4) it was incorrect to conclude that any United Kingdom jurisdiction to try the applicants either did not exist or was subordinate to Iraqi claims; (5) the court had applied the incorrect test in respect of the applicants’ claims concerning the fairness of any trial before the IHT; and (6) the court had erred in concluding that the evidence before it did not establish substantial grounds for believing there to be a real risk that the applicants’ trial would involve a flagrant breach of the principles guaranteed by Article 3. 65. On 22 December 2008 the Court of Appeal directed that the full appeal hearing would take place on 29 to 30 December 2008. It made an injunction prohibiting the applicants’ transfer before 4.30 p.m. on 30 December 2008. 66. Among the evidence placed before the Court of Appeal was a further statement by Mr Watkins concerning the ongoing negotiations with Iraq. He explained, inter alia, that the question of British forces being permitted to exercise detention powers in Iraq had been expressly rejected by Iraq in the course of the negotiations: “In the course of discussions on Sunday 21 December, Iraqi officials made clear that, even in relation to any proposed authorised tasks, they did not consider it acceptable for UK forces to exercise detention powers after 31 December 2008. It remains my firm and considered view that, in all the circumstances, there is no likelihood of the UK being able to secure any agreement from the Iraqi authorities that we may continue to hold the claimants either indefinitely or pending the outcome of this litigation. Further, as I said in my first witness statement, even raising the issue would risk adversely affecting the conduct and outcome of the current negotiations.” 67. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal at 2.30 p.m. on 30 December 2008, with the following short oral reasons. “(i) On the facts the United Kingdom is not exercising jurisdiction over the appellants within the meaning of ECHR, Article 1. See in particular Banković v. UK (2001) 11 BHRC 4. In essence the United Kingdom detains the appellants only at the request and to the order of the IHT, and is obliged to return them to the custody of the IHT by force of arrangements made between the United Kingdom and Iraq, and the United Kingdom has no discretionary power of its own to hold, release or return the appellants. They are acting purely as agents of the IHT. (ii) R(B) v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs [2005] QB 643 shows that an obligation of this kind to return persons to the host State has to be respected, albeit that the holding State in question is subject to ECHR obligations, unless – paragraph 88 – to return the appellants would expose them to a crime against humanity. We are bound by that decision, being a decision of this court. (iii) Neither the death penalty generally, nor the death penalty by hanging, is shown to be a crime against humanity or an act of torture. (iv) Accordingly, even if the United Kingdom is exercising Article 1 jurisdiction, contrary to our opinion, it is obliged to return the appellants to the custody of the IHT. That is so before 31 December 2008; a fortiori after 31 December 2008, when there will be no UN mandate, no provision as between the United Kingdom and Iraq granting inviolability to the British base or allowing for any detention of the appellants by the United Kingdom forces, save to the order of the IHT. In short, the United Kingdom will have no colour of legal power whatever after 31 December to do anything other than return the appellants to the order of the IHT. There will be no power to move the appellants anywhere else, nor indeed to prevent the Iraqis taking the appellants from British custody. British troops could not be ordered to take any steps to prevent that happening. Before 31 December it is true that the base at Basra is inviolable under local arrangements made between the United Kingdom and Iraq, but that inviolability ceases tomorrow. That is why the United Kingdom is thereafter entirely legally powerless to take action other than in compliance with the wishes of the IHT or to resist any action taken by the Iraqi authorities. (v) No freestanding claim against the United Kingdom under customary international law can run, nor is there on the facts any viable claim under ECHR, Article 6.” 68. The Court of Appeal refused the applicants permission to appeal to the House of Lords, stating that: “Certainly there are some important issues that have been raised but in the context of this case, having regard to the position that obtains post-31 December 2008, it would not be right to grant permission.” 69. The Court of Appeal also refused to grant the applicants interim relief pending either an application to the House of Lords for permission to appeal and for interim relief, or to this Court for interim measures. Shortly after 3 p.m. the Court of Appeal lifted the injunction which had prevented the applicants’ transfer until 4.30 p.m. on the same day. 70. The Court of Appeal handed down its full written judgment on 21 January 2009 ([2009] EWCA Civ 7). It found, firstly, that there were substantial grounds for believing that the applicants would face a real risk of execution if they were transferred to the custody of the IHT, for the following reasons. “It is common ground that the death penalty is a punishment available under Iraqi law for the offences with which the appellants are charged. The Divisional Court held (paragraph 148) that that was enough to give rise prima facie to a real risk of its being applied to the appellants. Accordingly, following the approach commended by the Strasbourg Court in Saadi v. Italy (application no. 37201/06, judgment of 28 February 2008), in particular at paragraph 129, the burden effectively shifted to the Secretary of State to show that such a risk was not in fact made out. Mr Lewis QC for the Secretary of State relied on evidence to the effect that the family of one of the victims had written to President Aref of the IHT to seek clemency for the appellants if they were found guilty. President Aref had earlier invited letters of this kind through the British embassy, indicating that it would be helpful if the embassy could waive claims to civil compensation and that he would then pass such letters to the trial chamber for their consideration. Ms Abda Sharif, Legal Adviser and Head of the Justice and Human Rights Section at the British embassy in Baghdad, has given evidence of legal advice to the effect that the impact of a plea of clemency by the families of the victims in Iraq is likely to be that the Iraqi court ‘will not impose the death penalty in any particular case’. Ms Sharif says that President Aref has confirmed that such a plea for clemency is likely to be an important factor for any court in assessing what sentence would be imposed on the claimants. She also produces a letter from President Aref, given to her at a meeting on 21 October 2008, in which the court’s procedures for considering sentence are described in some detail. The Divisional Court observed (paragraph 155): ‘That letter represents President Aref’s considered written position. It is striking that the letter gives no indication whatsoever that the death penalty would not be or even probably would not be imposed.’ Mr Lewis relied on the evidence of Mr Spillers, an American attorney who was the Rule of Law Liaison to the IHT between July 2008 and 22 December 2008. Mr Spillers had also met President Aref, on 27 October 2008. The President explained the factors which would influence the IHT against imposing a death sentence. These were ‘an admission of the crime by the claimants, a request for forgiveness from the family of the victims, a request for forgiveness of the court for the acts, and a request for leniency from the family of a victim’ (Divisional Court, paragraph 156). Mr Spillers reported the President as indicating that an assurance that the death penalty would not be imposed was ‘implicit’ in his account of these factors. Mr Spillers has provided a further statement since the Divisional Court’s judgment was delivered. He describes the outcome of the IHT proceedings in what has been called the 1991 Uprising case. The fifteen defendants were all former high-ranking members of Saddam Hussein’s regime charged with crimes against humanity. Three were acquitted. Ten received very substantial terms of imprisonment. Only the remaining two were sentenced to death, including one (‘Chemical Ali’) who was already under sentence of death following an earlier trial. ... In my judgment there is no sufficient basis for departing from the balanced assessment of the Divisional Court on this point. Mr Spillers’ new evidence concerning the 1991 Uprising case, while helpful to the Secretary of State, is not so substantial as to overturn the lower court’s conclusion. The real risk test is satisfied.” 71. In support of its conclusion that the applicants did not fall within the United Kingdom’s jurisdiction for the purposes of the Convention and the Human Rights Act 1998, the Court of Appeal observed as follows. 32. Until 31 December 2008 the United Kingdom forces at Basra enjoyed the guarantees of immunity and inviolability provided by CPA Order No. 17 (Revised). But those measures prohibited invasive sanctions; they did not confer executive power. In my judgment, from at least May 2006 until 31 December 2008, the British forces at Basra were not entitled to carry out any activities on Iraq’s territory in relation to criminal detainees save as consented to by Iraq, or otherwise authorised by a binding resolution or resolutions of the Security Council. So much flows from the fact of Iraq’s sovereignty and is not contradicted – quite the reverse – by any of the United Nations measures in the case. Thus the MNF mandate was extended by the Security Council at Iraq’s express request. The letter requesting its extension (which was attached to Resolution 1790 (2007)) expressly stated at paragraph 4, ‘[t]he government of Iraq will be responsible for arrest, detention and imprisonment tasks’. The various material Security Council Resolutions (1483 (2003), 1546 (2004) and 1790 (2007)) all emphasise the primacy of Iraqi sovereignty. As regards criminal detentions, CPA Memorandum No. 3 (Revised) makes it [plain] that so far as criminal detainees may be held by any national contingent of the MNF, they are held, in effect, to the order of the Iraqi authorities. 33. In these circumstances the United Kingdom was not before 31 December 2008 exercising any power or jurisdiction in relation to the appellants other than as agent for the Iraqi court. It was not exercising, or purporting to exercise, any autonomous power of its own as a sovereign State. 34. As I stated earlier, once the mandate expired there remained under international law no trace or colour of any power or authority whatever for the MNF, or any part of it, to maintain any presence in Iraq save only and strictly at the will of the Iraqi authorities. [Counsel for the applicants] sought to submit that the British base at Basra would by force of customary international law remain inviolable after 31 December. But she was unable to identify any principle which might, on the facts, support that position; and it is to my mind wholly inescapable that after that date British forces remaining in Iraq have done so only by consent of the Iraqi authorities and on such terms as those authorities have agreed. And it must have been plain, as soon as it was known when the mandate would come to an end, that this would be the true state of affairs. 35. And there is no sensible room for doubt but that the terms on which British forces would be permitted to remain in Iraq by the Iraqi authorities would not encompass any role or function which would permit, far less require, British (or any other) forces to continue to hold detainees. ... 36. After 31 December 2008 British forces enjoyed no legal power to detain any Iraqi. Had they done so, the Iraqi authorities would have been entitled to enter the premises occupied by the British and recover any such person so detained. 37. It is not easy to identify precisely the scope of the Article 1 jurisdiction where it is said to be exercised outside the territory of the impugned State Party, because the learning makes it clear that its scope has no sharp edge; it has to be ascertained from a combination of key ideas which are strategic rather than lexical. Drawing on the Banković judgment and their Lordships’ opinions in Al-Skeini, I suggest that there are four core propositions, though each needs some explanation. (1) It is an exceptional jurisdiction. (2) It is to be ascertained in harmony with other applicable norms of international law. (3) It reflects the regional nature of the Convention rights. (4) It reflects the indivisible nature of the Convention rights. The first and second of these propositions imply (as perhaps does the term jurisdiction itself) an exercise of sovereign legal authority, not merely de facto power, by one State on the territory of another. That is of itself an exceptional state of affairs, though well recognised in some instances such as that of an embassy. The power must be given by law, since if it were given only by chance or strength its exercise would by no means be harmonious with material norms of international law, but offensive to them; and there would be no principled basis on which the power could be said to be limited, and thus exceptional. ... It is impossible to reconcile a test of mere factual control with the limiting effect of the first two propositions I have set out, and, indeed, that of the last two, as I shall explain. 38. These first two propositions, understood as I have suggested, condition the others. If a State Party is to exercise Article 1 jurisdiction outside its own territory, the regional and indivisible nature of the Convention rights requires the existence of a regime in which that State enjoys legal powers wide enough to allow its vindication, consistently with its obligations under international law, of the panoply of Convention rights – rights which may however, in the territory in question, represent an alien political philosophy. 39. The ECHR’s natural setting is the espace juridique of the States Parties; if, exceptionally, its writ is to run elsewhere, this espace juridique must in considerable measure be replicated. In short the State Party must have the legal power to fulfil substantial governmental functions as a sovereign State. It may do so within a narrow scope, as an embassy, consulate, military base or prison; it may, in order to do so, depend on the host State’s consent or the mandate of the United Nations; but however precisely exemplified, this is the kind of legal power the State must possess: it must enjoy the discretion to decide questions of a kind which ordinarily fall to the State’s executive government. If the Article 1 jurisdiction is held to run in other circumstances, the limiting conditions imposed by the four propositions I have set out will be undermined.” 72. The Court of Appeal also considered the question of conflicting international-law obligations, which arose only if it was wrong about the lack of jurisdiction, and held that the Divisional Court had been correct in having regard to the United Kingdom’s obligation under international law to transfer the applicants to the custody of the IHT: “48. ... A State Party to the ECHR, exercising Article 1 jurisdiction in a foreign territory, may certainly owe duties arising under international law to the host State. Article 55 of the Vienna Convention [on Consular Relations, 1963], referred to in R(B) at paragraph 88, offers an obvious platform for such a potential duty. In this case the United Kingdom was plainly obliged under international law to transfer the applicants pursuant to the IHT’s request. In such instances, there may be a conflict between the State Party’s ECHR obligations and its international obligations. 49. One solution might have been to hold that the existence of such an international obligation is incompatible with the exercise of Article 1 jurisdiction, because it would show that the State Party’s legal power in the relevant foreign territory lacked the amplitude required to guarantee the Convention rights. In that case there would be no conflict. Such a comfort would of course be no comfort to the appellants – the duty to transfer them would without more negative the ECHR jurisdiction, so that they would enjoy no Convention rights. However, such an outcome would, I think, have been consistent with Banković; but this is not the direction our courts have taken. Both Al-Jedda and R(B) recognise that a State Party may be fixed with potentially inconsistent obligations arising under the ECHR and international law respectively. 50. With great respect I see no reason to doubt this position. While I have certainly asserted that the scope of the Article 1 jurisdiction has to accommodate the pressure on States Parties of international obligations apart from the ECHR, it by no means follows that the ECHR duty must always yield to the other obligation, so that no conflict can arise. No doubt it will be a matter for assessment in any case (where the issue sensibly arises) whether the international-law obligations are so pressing, or operate on so wide a front, as in effect to deprive the relevant State Party of the espace juridique which the Article 1 jurisdiction demands. They may not do so; and where they do not, this court’s decision in R(B) shows the correct juridical approach.” 73. The Court of Appeal rejected the applicants’ argument, based on Öcalan v. Turkey ([GC], no. 46221/99, ECHR 2005-IV), that where the proposed refoulement was to a State where after the trial the applicant might suffer the death penalty, no flagrant breach of the right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the Convention needed to be shown, only a real risk of an unfair trial. The court observed that Öcalan was not a refoulement case and that in Bader and Kanbor v. Sweden (no. 13284/04, ECHR 2005-XI), the Court had held that it was necessary in a deportation or extradition case for the applicant to establish a risk of suffering a flagrant denial of a fair trial in the receiving State, the outcome of which was or is likely to be the death penalty, before the Court could find a violation of Article 2 or 3 of the Convention. The Court of Appeal accepted the Divisional Court’s assessment of the evidence about the fairness of proceedings before the IHT and therefore also dismissed the complaint under Article 6. 74. Finally, the Court of Appeal rejected the applicants’ argument under international law that execution by hanging fell to be regarded as a crime against humanity, inhuman or degrading treatment or a form of torture. While terrible errors occurred from time to time, where for example the hanged man’s neck was not broken so that he suffocated, or the drop was too long so that he was decapitated, such evidence was anecdotal and partial. There was other evidence, such as that considered by the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, in its report of 1949-53, which found that hanging was “speedy and certain”. The court concluded that, since the evidence before it regarding this method of execution was very limited, it was in no position to arrive at any overall finding as to the effects of hanging for the purpose of making an assessment of its compatibility or otherwise with norms of customary international law. 75. The applicants’ lawyers contacted the Judicial Office of the House of Lords between 19 and 22 December 2008 but were advised that the Judicial Office would be closed over the Christmas and New Year period and would not reopen until 12 January 2009. 76. On 7 January 2009 the applicants’ request for legal aid to petition the House of Lords was refused, primarily on the basis that the transfer (see paragraph 80 below) meant that no effective remedy would be available. 77. On 6 February 2009 the applicants lodged a petition for leave to appeal with the House of Lords. It was refused on 16 February 2009. 78. On 22 December 2008, prior to the Court of Appeal hearing on interim relief, the applicants lodged an urgent application for interim measures under Rule 39 of this Court’s Rules. The Government made written representations to the Court as to why the applicants’ application should not be granted, copies of which were provided to the applicants. 79. Shortly after being informed of the ruling of the Court of Appeal on 30 December 2008, the Court gave an indication under Rule 39, informing the Government that the applicants should not be removed or transferred from the custody of the United Kingdom until further notice. 80. The applicants were transferred into the physical custody of the Iraqi authorities and admitted to Rusafa Prison on 31 December 2008. 81. On the afternoon of the same day, the Government informed the Court and the applicants’ solicitors that the applicants had been transferred. In their letter to the Court the Government stated: “... the Government took the view that, exceptionally, it could not comply with the measure indicated by the Court; and further that this action should not be regarded as a breach of Article 34 in this case. The Government regard the circumstances of this case as wholly exceptional. It remains the Government policy to comply with Rule 39 measures indicated by the Court as a matter of course where it is able to do so.” 82. In accordance with assurances given by the Iraqi Ministry of Justice in July and August 2008, the applicants were initially held at Rusafa Prison, Compound 4. In March 2009 they were transferred to Compound 1 of the same prison. 83. On 24 February 2009 Catherine Duncan (Legal Adviser at the British embassy in Baghdad) reminded President Aref of his previous statements on the death penalty. 84. The applicants’ trial before the IHT commenced on 11 May 2009. Each was represented by an Iraqi lawyer. The applicants were originally charged with killing the two British soldiers when they had clearly surrendered, an offence carrying a maximum penalty of the death sentence. 85. On 30 June 2009 this Court declared the application admissible and put further questions to the parties (see paragraphs 7-8 above). In particular, it requested the United Kingdom Government to inform it of the representations, if any, which had been made to the Iraqi authorities since the time of the applicants’ transfer with a view to ensuring that they would not be subjected to the death penalty if convicted. 86. On 21 July 2009, after the close of the evidence in the case, the prosecution read two letters to the trial chamber of the IHT. The first, dated 16 July 2009, was from the United Kingdom Government conveying their opposition to the death penalty and enclosing the letter received in August 2008 from the family of one of the murdered soldiers (see paragraphs 52 and 54 above). The second letter was from the sister of the other soldier, with whom the Government had made contact, also asking for clemency for the defendants. The Chief Trial Judge then read out a statement of charges against each applicant. The charges had been reduced from killing the soldiers to negligently handing them over to other Ba’ath Party officials who killed them, instead of protecting them and sending them for medical treatment as required by the Geneva Convention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field of 12 August 1949. This charge did not carry a death sentence. 87. At the next hearing, on 29 July 2009, a further charge was added, namely torture or inhuman treatment of the soldiers, contrary to the Geneva Conventions. According to Articles 13 and 24 §§ 1 and 5 of Law no. (10) 2005 on the Iraqi Higher Criminal Court, the penalty for this offence “shall be determined by the court taking into account the gravity of the crime as well as the individual circumstances, judicial precedents and relevant sentences issued by international criminal courts”. The Government informed the Court by a letter of 31 July 2009 that the President of the trial chamber had informed a British official in Baghdad that “[i]n his view, a death sentence was not the appropriate penalty in this case”. 88. On 9 September 2009 the IHT gave its verdict. It decided to cancel the charges against the applicants, due to insufficient evidence, and ordered their immediate release. Shortly thereafter the prosecutor lodged an appeal against this decision to the Court of Cassation. 89. By a letter of 12 January 2010, the Government informed the Court that the Court of Cassation had decided that the investigation had been incomplete and had ordered that the case be remitted for reinvestigation by the Iraqi authorities and retrial. The applicants remain in custody. 90. The Fourth Geneva Convention provides, inter alia: “Protected persons are entitled, in all circumstances, to respect for their persons, their honour, their family rights, their religious convictions and practices, and their manners and customs. They shall at all times be humanely treated, and shall be protected especially against all acts of violence or threats thereof and against insults and public curiosity. Women shall be especially protected against any attack on their honour, in particular against rape, enforced prostitution, or any form of indecent assault. Without prejudice to the provisions relating to their state of health, age and sex, all protected persons shall be treated with the same consideration by the Party to the conflict in whose power they are, without any adverse distinction based, in particular, on race, religion or political opinion. However, the Parties to the conflict may take such measures of control and security in regard to protected persons as may be necessary as a result of the war.” “Should the Power, in whose hands protected persons may be, consider the measures of control mentioned in the present Convention to be inadequate, it may not have recourse to any other measure of control more severe than that of assigned residence or internment, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 42 and 43. ...” “The internment or placing in assigned residence of protected persons may be ordered only if the security of the Detaining Power makes it absolutely necessary. If any person, acting through the representatives of the Protecting Power, voluntarily demands internment, and if his situation renders this step necessary, he shall be interned by the Power in whose hands he may be.” “Protected persons shall not be arrested, prosecuted or convicted by the Occupying Power for acts committed or for opinions expressed before the occupation, or during a temporary interruption thereof, with the exception of breaches of the laws and customs of war. ...” “Protected persons who have been accused of offences or convicted by the courts in occupied territory, shall be handed over at the close of occupation, with the relevant records, to the authorities of the liberated territory.” “If the Occupying Power considers it necessary, for imperative reasons of security, to take safety measures concerning protected persons, it may, at the most, subject them to assigned residence or to internment. ...” 91. This statute was enacted to give effect in United Kingdom domestic law to the provisions of the 1949 Geneva Conventions. It provides, inter alia: “1(1) Any person, whatever his nationality, who, whether in or outside the United Kingdom, commits, or aids, abets or procures the commission by any other person of a grave breach of any of the scheduled conventions or the first protocol shall be guilty of an offence.” The term “grave breach” is defined in each of the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and in Additional Protocol I as certain acts (including wilful killing, torture or inhuman treatment, wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health, extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly, wilfully depriving a prisoner of war or a civilian of the rights of fair and regular trial) committed against “protected persons” (as defined precisely in each Convention), including prisoners of war, civilians and the wounded. 92. The purpose of the Ministry of Defence’s Joint Doctrine Publication (JDP) 1-10 “Prisoners of War, Internees and Detainees” (May 2006) is as follows: “1. ... to provide high-level joint doctrinal guidance on how to deal with persons who fall into the hands of UK Armed Forces during military operations, whether Prisoners of War (PW), civilian internees or those detained as a result of suspected or actual criminal activity. 2. This Edition of JDP 1-10 is written primarily for the benefit of the United Kingdom operational Commander responsible for UK Forces’ compliance with domestic United Kingdom law, international law and the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC). It should prove useful to those involved in operational planning when the issues covered in this publication may arise. It is also intended to assist those responsible for all aspects of force protection and area security, personnel whose duties involve liaison with local civil authorities, UK Governmental Departments (Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), Home Office, Department for International Development (DFID)), Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and International Organisations (IOs), such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).” Chapter 1 of JDP 1-10.3 “Detainees” (July 2006) concerns the handling of detainees. It commences by stating as follows (footnotes omitted): “101. UK Armed Forces may be empowered under the Host Nation’s (HN) law to participate in the arrest of criminal suspects or may be involved in the arrest of persons indicted for war crimes. This chapter details the arrangements for the handling of such persons when they are being temporarily detained by UK Armed Forces during military operations abroad that do not amount to International Armed Conflict. 102. Detainees are a category of prisoner distinct from PW and internees. Detainees are those individuals who, during operations abroad not amounting to International Armed Conflict, are held by UK Armed Forces because they have committed, or are suspected of committing, criminal offences. 103. Detainees are a category of prisoner who can only be held during operations other than International Armed Conflict. It should be noted that, during International Armed Conflict, those who have committed or are suspected of committing criminal offences are categorised and treated as internees. 104. The provisions for the handling of detainees will vary according to the national laws of the territory in which UK Forces are operating, the nature of the operation and the legal framework under which UK Forces are operating. This is a complex area and specialist staff and policy advice will invariably be called for at the earliest stages of planning. Detainees should be handed over to the appropriate local authorities at the earliest opportunity, provided that there is no reason to believe they will suffer abuses of their human rights.” Section IV of JDP 1-10.3 is entitled “Transfers” and states: “113. Except for their repatriation or return to their country of residence after the cessation of hostilities, detainees must not be transferred to a State that is not a party to the GCs [Geneva Conventions]. Moreover, they may only be transferred to a State that is a party if the detaining State has satisfied itself that the receiving State is willing and able to apply the GCs. In the event of transfers taking place, the receiving State becomes responsible for the application of the GCs. Should that State fail to carry out its obligations in any important respect, it is the duty of the State which made the transfer either to take effective measures to correct the situation or to request the return of the persons affected. ... In no circumstances may a detainee be transferred to a State where he has reason to fear persecution on account of his political opinions or religious beliefs. 114. It should be borne in mind that the application of the European Convention on Human Rights to those held in UK facilities in some circumstances may impose additional restrictions on their transfer, in particular if they are likely to be tried for an offence which carries the death penalty.” Section V of JDP 1-10.3 deals with “Handover to the Host Nation Authorities”. It provides: “116. Detainees must be handed over to the HN authorities as soon as practicable in order that detainees can be dealt with according to the local criminal justice system. ... 117. There may be cases where handover to the HN cannot take place immediately: a. If the HN lacks sufficient criminal justice infrastructure to take custody of the detainee, for example, courts, police, custodial facilities and lawyers. b. If there are reasonable grounds to suspect the handover would compromise the safety of the detainee.” 93. Article 41 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 provides: “1. Without prejudice to their privileges and immunities, it is the duty of all persons enjoying such privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving State. They also have a duty not to interfere in the internal affairs of that State. 2. All official business with the receiving State entrusted to the mission by the sending State shall be conducted with or through the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the receiving State or such other ministry as may be agreed. 3. The premises of the mission must not be used in any manner incompatible with the functions of the mission as laid down in the present Convention or by other rules of general international law or by any special agreements in force between the sending and the receiving State.” 94. In R(B) v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, cited above, the Court of Appeal observed as follows: “In a case such as Soering the Contracting State commits no breach of international law by permitting an individual to remain within its territorial jurisdiction rather than removing him to another State. The same is not necessarily true where a State permits an individual to remain within the shelter of consular premises rather than requiring him to leave. It does not seem to us that the Convention can require States to give refuge to fugitives within consular premises if to do so would violate international law. So to hold would be in fundamental conflict with the importance that the Grand Chamber attached in Banković to principles of international law. Furthermore, there must be an implication that obligations under a Convention are to be interpreted, insofar as possible, in a manner that accords with international law. What has public international law to say about the right to afford ‘diplomatic asylum’? Oppenheim [Oppenheim’s International Law edited by the late Sir Robert Jennings QC and Sir Arthur Watts QC 9th edition vol 1] deals with this topic at paragraph 495, from which we propose to quote at a little length: ‘Paragraph 495: So-called diplomatic asylum The practice of granting diplomatic asylum in exceptional circumstances is of long-standing, but it is a matter of dispute to what extent it forms part of general international law. There would seem to be no general obligation on the part of the receiving State to grant an ambassador the right of affording asylum to a refugee, whether criminal or other, not belonging to this mission. Of course, an ambassador need not deny entrance to refugees seeking safety in the embassy. But as the International Court of Justice noted in the Asylum case ... in the absence of an established legal basis, such as is afforded by treaty or established custom, a refugee must be surrendered to the territorial authorities at their request and if surrender is refused, coercive measures may be taken to induce it. Bearing in mind the inviolability of embassy premises, the permissible limits of such measures are not clear. The embassy may be surrounded by soldiers, and ingress and egress prevented; but the legitimacy of forcing an entry in order forcibly to remove the refugee is doubtful, and measures involving an attack on the envoy’s person would clearly be unlawful. Coercive measures are in any case justifiable only in an urgent case, and after the envoy has in vain been requested to surrender the refugee. It is sometimes suggested that there is, exceptionally, a right to grant asylum on grounds of urgent and compelling reasons of humanity, usually involving the refugee’s life being in imminent jeopardy from arbitrary action. The practice of States has afforded instances of the grant of asylum in such circumstances. The grant of asylum ‘against the violent and disorderly action of irresponsible sections of the population’ is a legal right which, on grounds of humanity, may be exercised irrespective of treaty; the territorial authorities are bound to grant full protection to a diplomatic mission providing shelter for refugees in such circumstances. There is some uncertainty how far compelling reasons of humanity may justify the grant of asylum in other cases. The International Court’s judgment in the Asylum case suggests that the grant of asylum may be justified where ‘in the guise of justice, arbitrary action is substituted for the rule of law. Such would be the case if the administration of justice were corrupted by measures clearly prompted by political aims’. However, the Court went on to emphasise that ‘the safety which arises out of asylum cannot be construed as a protection against the regular application of the laws and against the jurisdiction of legally constituted tribunals’. Thus it would seem not to be enough to show that a refugee is to be tried for a ‘political’ offence: it must be shown that justice would be subordinated to political dictation and the usual judicial guarantees disregarded. Even where permissible, asylum is only a temporary expedient and may only be afforded so long as the reasons justifying it continue to subsist.’ The propositions in Oppenheim are based, to a large extent, on what seem to be the only juridical pronouncements on the topic to carry authority. On 20 November 1950 the International Court of Justice gave judgment in a dispute between Colombia and Peru that the two States had referred to the Court – Asylum Case (Colombia v. Peru) (1950) ICJ Rep. 206. Colombia had given refuge in its embassy in Peru to the leader of a military rebellion, which had been almost instantaneously suppressed. At issue was the effect of two Conventions to which both Colombia and Peru were party which made provision in relation to the grant of asylum to political refugees but not to criminals. Colombia’s arguments included the contention that by customary international law it was open to Colombia unilaterally to determine that the fugitive fell to be classified as a political refugee. Much of the judgment related to the effects of the two Conventions, but the Court made some general comments in relation to ‘diplomatic asylum’: ‘The arguments submitted in this respect reveal a confusion between territorial asylum (extradition), on the one hand, and diplomatic asylum, on the other. In the case of extradition, the refugee is within the territory of the State of refuge. A decision with regard to extradition implies only the normal exercise of the territorial sovereignty. The refugee is outside the territory of the State where the offence was committed, and a decision to grant him asylum in no way derogates from the sovereignty of that State. In the case of diplomatic asylum, the refugee is within the territory of the State where the offence was committed. A decision to grant diplomatic asylum involves a derogation from the sovereignty of that State. It withdraws the offender from the jurisdiction of the territorial State and constitutes an intervention in matters which are exclusively within the competence of the State. Such a derogation from territorial sovereignty cannot be recognised unless its legal basis is established in each particular case.’ In 1984 six fugitives who were subject to detention orders issued by the South African government sought refuge in the British Consulate in Durban. They became known as the Durban six. The British Government decided that it would not compel them to leave but that it would not intervene on their behalf with the South African authorities. They were told that they could not stay indefinitely and, eventually they left. Five of them were immediately arrested and charged with high treason, which carried the death penalty. We were referred to an Article in Human Rights Quarterly 11 (1989) by Susanne Riveles, which included the following propositions: ‘There exists no universally accepted international agreement to assure a uniform response by States to grant refuge in a mission in an emergency. Most countries, with the exception of those in Latin America, deny outright the claim to diplomatic asylum because it encroaches upon the State’s sovereignty. Some countries give limited recognition to the practice, allowing ‘temporary safe stay’ on a case-by-case basis to persons under threat of life and limb. It should be recognised that a State has the permissible response of granting temporary sanctuary to individuals or groups in utter desperation who face repressive measures in their home countries. Moreover, this should be considered a basic human right, to be invoked by those fleeing from the persecution for reasons of race, religion, or nationality, or for holding a political opinion in an emergency situation involving the threat of violence.’ Discussion We have concluded that, if the Soering approach is to be applied to diplomatic asylum, the duty to provide refuge can only arise under the Convention where this is compatible with public international law. Where a fugitive is facing the risk of death or injury as the result of lawless disorder, no breach of international law will be occasioned by affording him refuge. Where, however, the receiving State requests that the fugitive be handed over the situation is very different. The basic principle is that the authorities of the receiving State can require surrender of a fugitive in respect of whom they wish to exercise the authority that arises from their territorial jurisdiction; see Article 55 of the 1963 Vienna Convention. Where such a request is made the Convention cannot normally require the diplomatic authorities of the sending State to permit the fugitive to remain within the diplomatic premises in defiance of the receiving State. Should it be clear, however, that the receiving State intends to subject the fugitive to treatment so harsh as to constitute a crime against humanity, international law must surely permit the officials of the sending State to do all that is reasonably possible, including allowing the fugitive to take refuge in the diplomatic premises, in order to protect him against such treatment. In such circumstances the Convention may well impose a duty on a Contracting State to afford diplomatic asylum. It may be that there is a lesser level of threatened harm that will justify the assertion of an entitlement under international law to grant diplomatic asylum. This is an area where the law is ill-defined. So far as Australian law was concerned, the applicants had escaped from lawful detention under the provisions of the Migration Act 1958. On the face of it international law entitled the Australian authorities to demand their return. We do not consider that the United Kingdom officials could be required by the Convention and the Human Rights Act to decline to hand over the applicants unless this was clearly necessary in order to protect them from the immediate likelihood of experiencing serious injury.” 95. At its meeting on 21 February 2002, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted the text of Protocol No. 13 to the Convention and authorised the publication of the following explanatory report (footnotes omitted): “1. The right to life, ‘an inalienable attribute of human beings’ and ‘supreme value in the international hierarchy of human rights’ is unanimously guaranteed in legally binding standards at universal and regional levels. 2. When these international standards guaranteeing the right to life were drawn up, exceptions were made for the execution of the death penalty when imposed by a court of law following a conviction of a crime for which this penalty was provided for by law (cf., for example, Article 2 § 1 of the ... Convention ...). 3. However, as illustrated below, there has since been an evolution in domestic and international law towards abolition of the death penalty, both in general and, more specifically, for acts committed in time of war. 4. At the European level, a landmark stage in this general process was the adoption of Protocol No. 6 to the Convention in 1982. This Protocol, which to date has been ratified by almost all States Parties to the Convention, was the first legally binding instrument in Europe – and in the world – which provided for the abolition of the death penalty in time of peace, neither derogations in emergency situations nor reservations being permitted. Nonetheless, under Article 2 of the said Protocol, ‘A State may make provision in its law for the death penalty in respect of acts committed in time of war or of imminent threat of war’. However, according to the same Article, this possibility was restricted to the application of the death penalty in instances laid down in the law and in accordance with its provisions. 5. Subsequently, the Parliamentary Assembly established a practice whereby it required from States wishing to become a member of the Council of Europe that they committed themselves to apply an immediate moratorium on executions, to delete the death penalty from their national legislation, and to sign and ratify Protocol No. 6. The Parliamentary Assembly also put pressure on countries which failed or risked failing to meet the commitments they had undertaken upon accession to the Council of Europe. More generally, the Assembly took the step in 1994 of inviting all member States who had not yet done so, to sign and ratify Protocol No. 6 without delay (Resolution 1044 (1994) on the abolition of capital punishment). 6. This fundamental objective to abolish the death penalty was also affirmed by the Second Summit of Heads of State and Government of member States of the Council of Europe (Strasbourg, October 1997). In the Summit’s Final Declaration, the Heads of State and Government called for the ‘universal abolition of the death penalty and [insisted] on the maintenance, in the meantime, of existing moratoria on executions in Europe’. For its part, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe has indicated that it ‘shares the Parliamentary Assembly’s strong convictions against recourse to the death penalty and its determination to do all in its power to ensure that capital executions cease to take place’. The Committee of Ministers subsequently adopted a Declaration ‘For a European Death Penalty-Free Area’. 7. In the meantime, significant related developments in other fora had taken place. In June 1998, the European Union adopted ‘Guidelines to EU Policy Toward Third Countries on the Death Penalty’ which, inter alia, state its opposition to this penalty in all cases. Within the framework of the United Nations, a Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, was adopted in 1989. For a few years, the UN Commission on Human Rights has regularly adopted Resolutions which call for the establishment of moratoria on executions, with a view to completely abolishing the death penalty. It should also be noted that capital punishment has been excluded from the penalties that the International Criminal Court and the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda are authorised to impose. 8. The specific issue of the abolition of the death penalty also in respect of acts committed in time of war or of imminent threat of war should be seen against the wider background of the above-mentioned developments concerning the abolition of the death penalty in general. It was raised for the first time by the Parliamentary Assembly in Recommendation 1246 (1994), in which it recommended that the Committee of Ministers draw up an additional protocol to the Convention, abolishing the death penalty both in peace- and in wartime. 9. While the Steering Committee for Human Rights (CDDH), by a large majority, was in favour of drawing up such an additional protocol, the Committee of Ministers at the time considered that the political priority was to obtain and maintain moratoria on executions, to be consolidated by complete abolition of the death penalty. 10. A significant further step was made at the European Ministerial Conference on Human Rights, held in Rome on 3-4 November 2000 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Convention, which pronounced itself clearly in favour of the abolition of the death penalty in time of war. In Resolution II adopted by the Conference, the few member States that had not yet abolished the death penalty nor ratified Protocol No. 6 were urgently requested to ratify this Protocol as soon as possible and, in the meantime, respect strictly the moratoria on executions. In the same Resolution, the Conference invited the Committee of Ministers ‘to consider the feasibility of a new additional protocol to the Convention which would exclude the possibility of maintaining the death penalty in respect of acts committed in time of war or of imminent threat of war’ (paragraph 14 of Resolution II). The Conference also invited member States which still had the death penalty for such acts to consider its abolition (ibidem). 11. In the light of texts recently adopted and in the context of the Committee of Ministers’ consideration of the follow-up to be given to the Rome Conference, the Government of Sweden presented a proposal for an additional protocol to the Convention at the 733rd meeting of the Ministers’ Deputies (7 December 2000). The proposed protocol concerned the abolition of the death penalty in time of war as in time of peace. 12. At their 736th meeting (10-11 January 2001), the Ministers’ Deputies instructed the CDDH ‘to study the Swedish proposal for a new protocol to the Convention ... and submit its views on the feasibility of a new protocol on this matter’. 13. The CDDH and its Committee of Experts for the Development of Human Rights (DH-DEV) elaborated the draft protocol and the explanatory report thereto in the course of 2001. The CDDH transmitted the draft protocol and explanatory report to the Committee of Ministers on 8 November 2001. The latter adopted the text of the Protocol on 21 February 2002 at the 784th meeting of the Ministers’ Deputies and opened it for signature by member States of the Council of Europe on 3 May 2002.” 96. On 26 June 2007 PACE adopted the following resolution on the “Promotion by Council of Europe member States of an international moratorium on the death penalty”: “1. The Parliamentary Assembly confirms its strong opposition to the death penalty in all circumstances. The death penalty is the ultimate form of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment: it violates the right to life. The Assembly takes pride in its decisive contribution to making the member States of the Council of Europe a de facto death penalty-free zone, and strongly regrets the fact that one European country – Belarus – still carries out executions. 2. The Assembly has also on several occasions taken a strong stand against executions in other parts of the world, and in particular in the Council of Europe observer States which retain the death penalty, namely Japan and the United States of America. 3. It notes with satisfaction that the death penalty is on the decline worldwide, as shown by a 25% decrease in executions and death sentences between 2005 and 2006. 4. It also draws attention to the fact that more than 90% of known executions in 2006 took place in only six countries: China, Iran, Pakistan, Iraq, Sudan, and the United States of America – a Council of Europe observer State. Based on available public records, which may cause the number of executions to be underestimated in countries lacking free media or an accountable government, China alone accounts for more than two thirds of all executions worldwide. Iran’s execution rate nearly doubled from 2005 to 2006. Iraq also witnessed a dramatic increase in executions in 2006, bringing the number up to 65. Saudi Arabia, among the worst offenders in 2005, saw a decrease in 2006 to 39 executions, but witnessed an upsurge in early 2007 (48 executions through to the end of April). 5. The small number of countries that still resort to executions on a significant scale is becoming increasingly isolated in the international community. Between 1977 and 2006, the number of abolitionist countries rose from 16 to 89. This number increases to 129 when including those countries which have not carried out any executions for the past ten years or more and which can therefore be considered as abolitionist in practice. The time is now ripe to give new impetus to the campaign in favour of a death penalty-free world. 6. The Assembly therefore strongly welcomes Italian efforts in the United Nations General Assembly in advocating for a moratorium on the death penalty, as well as the support of the European Union for this initiative, and expects it to be proceeded with in such a manner as to guarantee the best possible success within the United Nations. 7. A moratorium on executions is but one step in the right direction, the ultimate goal remaining the complete abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances. 8. In the meantime, a moratorium is an important step as it saves lives immediately and has the potential of demonstrating to the public in retentionist countries that an end to State-sponsored killings does not lead to any increase in violent crime. On the contrary, a moratorium on executions can bring about a change of atmosphere in society fostering greater respect for the sanctity of human life, and thus contribute to reversing the trend towards ever-increasing hate and violence. 9. Finally, a universal moratorium on the death penalty represents a concrete and highly symbolic political act, which could help change an international climate which is all too often characterised by violent actions which take their victims – by no means exclusively in a context of conflict – from among civilian populations. A universal moratorium on the death penalty would also make a significant contribution to the establishment of a shared and operational body of principles and rules leading towards a more effective rule of law at international level. 10. The Assembly calls on all member and observer States of the Council of Europe to actively support the initiative for the abolition of the death penalty in the UN General Assembly and to make the best use of their influence in order to convince countries that are still on the sidelines to join in. In this context, it warmly welcomes the resolution in the same spirit, adopted by the European Parliament on 26 April 2007, on the initiative for a universal moratorium on the death penalty. 11. At the Luxembourg meeting of 18 June 2007, the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) of the European Union unanimously made a formal commitment to tabling – at the next session of the General Assembly of the United Nations – a resolution calling for a moratorium on executions all over the world. 12. The Assembly recalls that, whilst 60 States have so far ratified the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1989 to promote the universal abolition of the death penalty, 10 Council of Europe member and observer States have not yet done so, namely Albania, Armenia, France, Japan (observer), Latvia, Mexico (observer), Poland (signed but not ratified), the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and the United States of America (observer). For countries which have de facto and de jure abolished the death penalty (Albania, Armenia, France, Latvia, Mexico (observer), Poland and Ukraine), or which maintain a moratorium (Russian Federation), the ratification of the Second Optional Protocol to the ICCPR would be a valuable gesture of political support for abolition, and would contribute to further isolating the remaining retentionist countries. 13. The Council of Europe’s own instruments against the death penalty are also still lacking ratifications. In particular, Protocol No. 6 to the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the abolition of the death penalty (ETS No. 114) has still not been ratified by the Russian Federation, despite the commitment to do so undertaken upon its accession to the Council of Europe in 1996. Protocol No. 13 to the Convention concerning the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances (ETS No. 187), including in time of war or imminent threat of war, has still not been signed by Azerbaijan and the Russian Federation, and has still not been ratified by Armenia, France, Italy, Latvia, Poland and Spain. For the sake of the strong and unified signal to be sent by the Council of Europe as a whole, the Assembly calls on the countries concerned to sign and ratify these instruments without further delay. 14. The Assembly notes in this context that Italy’s Chamber of Deputies approved on 2 May 2007, in a second reading, the constitutional bill containing amendments to Article 27 of the Constitution concerning the abolition of the death penalty; the bill is presently before the senate for its second reading and final adoption under the current procedure for constitutional revision. The bill aims to delete from Article 27 § 4 the following words: ‘unless in the cases provided for by military laws in case of war’, thus eliminating any reference to the death penalty in the Italian Constitution and making it possible to ratify Protocol No. 13 to the Convention. 15. Also, the Assembly reiterates its view, noted in Recommendation 1760 (2006) on the position of the Parliamentary Assembly as regards the Council of Europe member and observer States which have not abolished the death penalty, that the death penalty should be abolished in Abkhazia, South Ossetia and the Transnistrian Moldavan Republic, and that the sentences of all prisoners currently on death row in these territories should be immediately commuted to terms of imprisonment in order to put an end to the cruel and inhuman treatment of those who have been kept on death row for years in a state of uncertainty as to their ultimate fate. 16. The Assembly fully supports the Conference to establish a European Day against the Death Penalty, to be held in Lisbon on 9 October 2007, and expects all member States of the Council of Europe also to show their unstinting support. Given its pioneering work on the abolition of the death penalty in Europe and beyond, the Assembly must play a central role, including through involvement in the drafting of the joint declaration, which its President should co-sign at the inaugural conference. The Assembly will stand ready to contribute to publicity and promotion, including through coordination of supporting events in member States’ national parliaments.” 97. In Chitat Ng v. Canada (Communication No. 469/1991, UN Doc. CCPR/C/49/D/469/1991, 7 January 1994), the United Nations Human Rights Committee found that Mr Ng’s extradition to the United States of America, where he risked execution, gave rise to a violation by Canada of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The Committee made the following request: “18. The Human Rights Committee requests the State Party to make such representations as might still be possible to avoid the imposition of the death penalty and appeals to the State Party to ensure that a similar situation does not arise in the future.” 98. In Roger Judge v. Canada (Communication No. 829/1998, UN Doc. CCPR/C/78/D/829/1998, 20 October 2003), the Committee found that Mr Judge’s deportation to the United States, where he had been sentenced to be executed, gave rise to violations by Canada of the ICCPR, and continued: “12. Pursuant to Article 2 § 3 (a) of the Covenant, the Committee concludes that the author is entitled to an appropriate remedy which would include making such representations as are possible to the receiving State to prevent the carrying out of the death penalty on the author.” 99. In its judgment of 11 October 2002 in Boumediene and Others, the Human Rights Chamber for Bosnia and Herzegovina found a number of violations of the Convention arising from the transfer of the claimants, who had been detained in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to the custody of the US security services who subsequently removed them to the US Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay. The Human Rights Chamber then ordered Bosnia and Herzegovina, inter alia, to take all possible steps to prevent the death penalty from being pronounced against and executed on the applicants, including attempts to seek assurances from the United States via diplomatic contacts that the applicants would not be subjected to the death penalty.","['13', '3', '34']",[],[],['6'],[],[],1
172,001-57647,ENG,FRA,CHAMBER,1990,CASE OF DELTA v. FRANCE,2,Violation of Art. 6-1+6-3-d;Not necessary to examine Art. 6-2;Damage - financial award;Costs and expenses - claim dismissed,C. Russo,"9. Mr Michel Sophie Delta is a French citizen who was born in Guadeloupe and lives there today after having spent some time in metropolitan France. 10. At 6.40 p.m. on 29 March 1983 a girl of 16, Miss Poggi, and a friend of the same age, Miss Blin, were in a Paris underground station when two coloured men accosted them. One of the men snatched a gold chain and crucifix which Miss Poggi was wearing round her neck and ran towards the exit. 11. The two girls immediately went to the central police station of the 12th District, and at 7 p.m., as a result, Mr Delta was arrested by Police Constable Bonci, accompanied by the two girls, in a building by the exit from the underground. The victim and her friend immediately said they recognised him. A search of the applicant and subsequently of the premises yielded nothing, however. 12. The applicant was taken to the central police station of the 12th District and questioned at 8.40 p.m. by Chief Inspector Mercier, an officier de police judiciaire, about his identity and means of subsistence and was then taken into police custody. 13. From 10 a.m. to 10.20 a.m. the following day, Inspector Duban, who was likewise an officier de police judiciaire, took a statement from him about the facts of the case. Mr Delta said that at about 6.30 p.m. he had been set upon by four people who had chased him into the underground and stolen a cigarette lighter and 100 francs from him. He surmised that one of them could have committed the robbery as the two girls went by. He said that he had run away because he had been put in fear by his four attackers. Subsequently (the exact time is not given in the police report), Inspector Duban interviewed both girls separately, each in the presence of her mother. They confirmed that the person who had been arrested was indeed the person who had committed the offence. The victim lodged a complaint alleging robbery. Mr Delta was never formally confronted with Miss Poggi and Miss Blin. 14. The Chief Superintendent in charge of the Fourth Area police force forwarded the file to the public prosecutor’s office. 15. The Paris public prosecutor considered that a judicial investigation was unnecessary and accordingly used the direct committal procedure (Articles 393 to 397-7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as amended by the ""Security and Freedom"" Act of 2 February 1987). 16. On 31 March 1983 Mr Delta appeared before the 23rd Division of the Paris Criminal Court, which made an interlocutory order for a psychiatric report and a social inquiry report and remanded him in custody. 17. On 5 May the court passed a sentence of three years’ imprisonment on him. The judgment contained the following reasons: ""The facts (robbery by snatching a neckchain and crucifix from the victim) [are established], notwithstanding the defendant’s denials, by the evidence obtained, in particular by means of the statements of Police Constable Bonci, who gave evidence on oath. The defendant must be convicted and punished very severely, having regard to the nature of the offence committed with the use of violence. Moreover, in a judgment dated 22 October 1981 Delta ... was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment by the Paris Court of Appeal for robbery and consequently is legally a reoffender under Article 58 of the Criminal Code; ..."" 18. Although they had been duly summoned by the prosecution, the two girls did not attend the trial and gave no reasons for their failure to do so. The court did not take any steps to have them brought before it under Article 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 24 below). The accused, whose defence was in the hands of two trainee barristers who had successively been assigned to him by the court, had not submitted any pleadings suggesting that any witnesses should be examined or asking for any further inquiries to be made into the facts. 19. Mr Delta appealed, claiming that he was the victim of mistaken identity. Relying on Article 513, second paragraph, of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 25 below) and Article 6 para. 3 (d) (art. 6-3-d) of the Convention, he also expressly sought to have the victim, the person who was with her and two witnesses on his behalf called; he asserted that he had himself urged the concierge and a resident in the building where he had taken refuge to alert the police, as he feared for his safety if his pursuers caught up with him. 20. On 28 September 1983 the Paris Court of Appeal (10th Division) upheld the whole of the judgment of the court below after refusing the application for examination of witnesses in the following terms: ""After the defendant’s arrest, Miss Poggi formally stated that he was the man who had snatched the chain from her. Miss Blin likewise identified Delta as being responsible for the snatch theft from Miss Poggi. These statements satisfy the Court that the defendant was guilty of the offences charged and make the requested examination of witnesses unnecessary."" 21. Mr Delta appealed on points of law, alleging a violation of Article 6 para. 3 (d) (art. 6-3-d) of the Convention and Article 513 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The Court of Cassation (Criminal Division) dismissed the appeal in a judgment of 4 October 1984 on the following grounds: ""It appears from the impugned judgment of the Court of Appeal that Delta, who was prosecuted for robbery and claimed to be the victim of mistaken identity, asked the Court of Appeal to order an examination of the victim and of witnesses, and that the court below, after studying the statements taken during the investigation from Miss Poggi, the victim, and from the witness Bonci, refused this application on the grounds that those statements satisfied it that the defendant was guilty of the offences charged and made the requested examination of witnesses unnecessary. In so holding, the Court of Appeal, far from violating the provisions of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, gave its decision a legal basis. The ground of appeal, which does no more than attempt to call in question the appeal court’s final assessment of all the evidence adduced at the trial and of whether it was appropriate to order further inquiries into the facts, cannot be accepted. ..."" 22. Mr Delta was released on 9 September 1985, after spending a little over two years and five months in prison. 23. In French law the rules governing the examination of witnesses by criminal courts differ according to whether the court is hearing the case at first instance or on appeal. 24. The main provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure applicable in the Criminal Court are the following: ""Anyone called to be heard as a witness shall be required to appear, to take the oath and to give evidence."" ""A witness who fails to appear or who refuses either to take the oath or to give evidence may, on an application by the public prosecutor, be punished by the court as provided for in Article 109."" ""If a witness fails to appear and has not put forward any excuse recognised as being valid and legitimate, the court may, on an application by the public prosecutor or of its own motion, order the witness to be brought before it immediately by the police in order to be examined or adjourn the case. ..."" ""Before proceeding to examine the witnesses, the presiding judge shall question the accused and take statements from him. The public prosecutor and, through the presiding judge, the civil party seeking damages and the defence may put questions to him."" ""The witnesses shall subsequently give their evidence in turn, either as to the offences with which the accused is charged or as to his personality and morals. The witnesses called by the prosecuting parties shall be heard first, subject to the presiding judge’s discretion to determine himself the order in which the witnesses shall be heard. With the court’s leave, evidence may also be given by persons suggested by the parties and who are present at the beginning of the trial but have not been formally summoned."" ""Witnesses shall give evidence orally. Exceptionally, however, they may, with the leave of the presiding judge, make use of documents."" ""After each witness has testified, the presiding judge shall put to him any questions he deems necessary and, where appropriate, those that are suggested to him by the parties. A witness may withdraw after testifying, unless the presiding judge decides otherwise. The public prosecutor, the civil party seeking damages and the accused may request, and the presiding judge may always order, that a witness should temporarily withdraw from the hearing-room after giving evidence in order to be brought back and examined if necessary after other witnesses have given evidence, with or without a confrontation."" ""During the trial the presiding judge shall, if necessary, have the exhibits shown to the accused or witnesses again and shall hear their comments."" 25. The procedure laid down by law for the Criminal Court also applies in principle to the Court of Appeal but subject to an important proviso in the second paragraph of Article 513 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which reads: ""Witnesses shall be heard only if the court [of appeal] so orders."" 26. This provision has given rise to a line of decisions by the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation, which appears to have departed from these precedents in 1989, that is to say after the events in the instant case. 27. The Criminal Division decided very early on that appeal courts were not required to hear afresh witnesses who had already given evidence at the original trial, even where an application had been made for them to be re-examined; it did, however, lay on them the obligation to hear and determine any applications made and to give reasons for any refusal (30 October and 13 December 1890, Bulletin criminel (Bull.) nos. 212 and 253; 20 October 1892, Recueil périodique Dalloz (DP) 1894, I, p. 140; 13 January 1916, DP 1921, I, p. 63; 20 December 1955, Dalloz 1956, sommaires, p. 29). Where they considered it useful or necessary, appeal courts could summon witnesses who had not testified in the Criminal Court; but if they refused to call such witnesses, it was sufficient by way of reasons if they stated in their judgment that there was no need for further inquiries into the facts (20 October 1892, Bull. no. 212; 9 February 1924, Bull. no. 70; 5 November 1975, Bull. no. 237, p. 629). 28. The Criminal Division’s approach seems to have changed markedly in its Randhawa judgment of 12 January 1989: ""By Article 6 para. 3 (d) (art. 6-3-d) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ‘everyone charged with a criminal offence has the [right] to examine or have examined witnesses against him’. It follows that, unless it is impossible for reasons which they must specify, courts of appeal are bound, on a properly made application, to order the examination in the presence of the parties of prosecution witnesses who have not been confronted with the defendant at any stage of the proceedings. Sarb Randhawa, who was charged with drug-trafficking and a customs offence, made an application to the Court of Appeal for an examination inter partes of the witnesses Joris Suray and Catherine Guillaume, whom he had had summoned and whose statements provided, he claimed, the sole basis for the finding of guilt. He said that he had not been able to have them examined at any stage of the proceedings. In support of its refusal of this application, and although it based its finding of the defendant’s guilt solely on the statements of the aforementioned witnesses, the court below noted merely that the witnesses whose examination had been sought had been interviewed during the police inquiries and the judicial investigation and that the defendant had been informed of the charges arising from their statements. But while a refusal to hear evidence from a prosecution witness does not, as such, infringe the aforementioned provisions of the Convention, since the court may take into account any special difficulties entailed by an inter partes examination of a given witness, for example the risk of intimidation, pressure or reprisals, such a refusal must nevertheless comply with the rights of the defence and the court must explain why a confrontation is impossible. This was not so in the instant case, and the judgment must accordingly be set aside ..."" (Bull. 1989, no. 13, pp. 37-38) This approach was confirmed in a judgment of 22 March 1989 (case of X, Bull. 1989, no. 144, pp. 369-371).",['6'],"['6-1', '6-3']",['6-3-d'],[],[],[],1

The applicant is a Turkish citizen who was born in 1957 and lives in Istanbul. 9. At the material time, the applicant was the major shareholder in Deniz Basın Yayın Sanayi ve Ticaret Organizasyon, a Turkish limited liability company which owns a weekly review entitled Haberde Yorumda Gerçek (“The Truth of News and Comments”), published in Istanbul. 10. The issue dated 26 April 1992 contained a news report providing information given at a press conference by a delegation - which included two former Turkish parliamentarians Leyla Zana and Orhan Doğan, Lord Avebury and a member of the Anglican Church - on its visit to Şırnak village, in the wake of tensions in the area. The news report included an article reporting the Governor of Şırnak as having told the delegation that the Şırnak Chief of Police had given an order to open fire on the people. It further rendered a dialogue between Leyla Zana, Orhan Doğan and İsmet Yediyıldız, a Gendarme Commander. The relevant part of the report read:  “Gendarmerie Regiment Commander İsmet Yediyıldız: ‘Your blood would not quench my thirst…’ While the British delegation and Diyarbakır MP Leyla Zana, Şırnak MP Orhan Doğan and Bismil District Governor Mehmet Kurdoğlu managed to persuade the people of Tepe village, which was blockaded by the security forces, after talking to them for a while and telling them that permission had been obtained for them to get the bodies of their dead, an interesting conversation took place between Diyarbakır Security Director Ramazan Er and Gendarmerie Regiment Commander İsmet Yediyıldız. The conversation between the MPs Leyla Zana and Orhan Doğan on the one hand and Colonel İsmet Yediyıldız on the other hand was recounted by Leyla Zana as follows: Colonel Yediyıldız: What business do you have here? There had been nobody here until you arrived. You have come and stirred things up again. Leyla Zana: No, Sir. The situation had been extremely tense before we arrived. We have come with the District Governor and are trying to calm down the tension here. Here is the District Governor. Colonel Yediyıldız: No, that’s not true. We saw when we were flying by helicopter that there was nobody here before. People gathered when you arrived. Orhan Doğan: No, you can ask the District Governor if you like. (Meanwhile, District Governor Mehmet Kurdoğlu was also being told off.) Colonel Yediyıldız: Do you know who these dead people are? Orhan Doğan: Yes, they are our children, the children of all of us. Colonel Yediyıldız: No, these are not our children, they are your children. Orhan Doğan: But my Colonel ... Colonel Yediyıldız: Do not call me your colonel. I am not your colonel. Your blood would not quench my thirst. You should also be honest and freely admit that my blood would not quench your thirst. Right now I could kill you like a rat. Your death would give us pleasure. Your blood would not quench my thirst. Leyla Zana: If the problem can be solved by killing us, then here are our people; let’s go among them and you kill us and this problem is solved. Colonel Yediyıldız: No, I would not kill you now. I would kill you after disgracing you in the eyes of the people.” 11. On 29 May 1992 the Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul National Security Court (İstanbul Devlet Güvenlik Mahkemesi) charged the applicant, being the owner of the review, with revealing the identity of officials mandated to fight terrorism and thus rendering them terrorist targets. The charges were brought under section 6 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 (""the 1991 Act""; see paragraph 16 below). 12. In the proceedings before the Istanbul National Security Court the applicant denied the charges and advanced the following arguments in his defence. The news report had been published with the aim of informing the public of the events which had occurred during the 1992 Newroz celebrations. It had been based on a joint press declaration by former deputies Leyla Zana and Orhan Doğan and an English delegation, during their visit to south-east Turkey. By virtue of the fact that section 6 of the 1991 Act contained an absolute prohibition on the disclosure and dissemination of the identity of officials appointed to fight terrorism, it enabled officials to abuse their authority, violate the law and subject citizens to ill-treatment. The right to receive and impart information, including information concerning acts of officials, was fundamental in a democratic society. Section 6 of the 1991 Act contravened not only the Turkish Constitution but also Article 10 of the Convention. 13. In a judgment of 2 September 1993 the National Security Court convicted the applicant under section 6 of the 1991 Act and sentenced him to pay a fine of 54,000,000 Turkish lira. It noted that the news report had contained an allegation to the effect that the Governor of Şırnak had stated to the visiting delegation that the Şırnak Chief of Police had given an order to open fire on the people. It had further affirmed that a gendarme commander had stated to Orhan Doğan in Leyla Zana’s presence ""[y]our death would give us pleasure. Your blood would not quench my thirst"". By having disclosed the identity of these officials, the publication had rendered them targets for terrorist attack. 14. The applicant appealed, reiterating his defence before the National Security Court. He also argued that the press declaration at issue had already been reported in other newspapers and magazines and that the incriminated news report had added nothing to these. 15. On 10 December 1993 the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal. It upheld the cogency of the National Security Court's assessment of the evidence and its reasoning for rejecting the applicant's defence. 16. The relevant provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 read as follows: “It shall be an offence, punishable by a fine of from five million to ten million Turkish liras, to announce, orally or in the form of a publication, that terrorist organisations will commit an offence against a specific person, whether or not that person’s ... identity is divulged, provided that it is done in such a manner that he or she may be identified, or to reveal the identity of civil servants who have participated in anti-terrorist operations or to designate any person as a target. It shall be an offence, punishable by a fine of from five million to ten million Turkish liras, to print or publish declarations or leaflets emanating from terrorist organisations. … Where the offences contemplated in the above paragraphs are committed through the medium of periodicals within the meaning of section 3 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680), the publisher shall also be liable to a fine equal to ninety per cent of the income from the average sales for the previous month if the periodical appears more frequently than monthly, or from the sales of the previous issue if the periodical appears monthly or less frequently, or from the average sales for the previous month of the daily newspaper with the largest circulation if the offence involves printed matter other than periodicals or if the periodical has just been launched.2 However, the fine may not be less than fifty million Turkish liras. The editor of the periodical shall be ordered to pay a sum equal to half the fine imposed on the publisher.” 17. The relevant provisions of domestic law governing the organisation and procedure of the National Security Court are quoted in paragraphs 3233 of the Sürek no. 1 v. Turkey judgment, which is being delivered on the same date as the present judgment.","['10', '6']",['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant is a limited liability company registered in Moscow. 6. On 2 September 1992 the applicant company purchased an aircraft from the Kharkiv State Aviation Industrial Enterprise (Харківське державне авіаційне підприємство, hereafter “the Enterprise”) for 5 million United States dollars (USD). By February 1993 this amount had been paid in full to the Enterprise. On 19 April 1993 the applicant company and the Enterprise signed an aircraft acceptance certificate, entailing, according to the applicant company, the transfer of ownership. On 20 April 1993 a Ukrainian crew – including the chief pilot Mr I. – flew the aircraft to Russia. 7. Until April 1994 the aircraft underwent test flights at the Ramenskoye airfield, located in the Moscow region. On 5 April 1994 and for unspecified reasons, the aircraft was flown back to Ukraine where it landed at the Enterprise’s airfield. 8. In the meantime, namely on 30 March 1994, a Ukrainian Customs officer had drawn up a report that customs rules had been violated. According to this report, when the aircraft had crossed the Ukrainian-Russian border in April 1993, it had been declared by officials of the Enterprise as temporarily exported for test flights whereas it had in fact been exported by way of sale to the applicant company. 9. On 27 May 1994 the Ukrainian Customs authorities instituted criminal proceedings for the attempted smuggling of the aircraft to Russia. On an unspecified date the case was transmitted to the Kharkiv Regional Department of the Security Service (Управління Служби Безпеки України по Харківській області, hereafter “the USBU”). 10. By rulings of 3 December 1994 and 13 November 1995, the USBU investigator decided to classify the aircraft as material evidence (визнав речовим доказом) and attached it to the case file pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings. 11. On 14 December 1995 the Deputy Head of the Investigative Unit of the USBU decided to put the aircraft up for sale by issuing a formal order to this effect (ухвала про долю речового доказу). 12. By letter of 17 January 1995 the Acting Head of the Investigative Unit of the USBU informed the applicant company that the aircraft had been acquired by the Ministry of the Interior (hereafter “the Ministry”) for amount of USD 25,000. 13. On an unspecified date the USBU investigator charged Mr I. with smuggling. In August 1996, the same charge was brought against the Enterprise’s Deputy Director General Mr N. and – in July 1997 – also against the Enterprise’s Director General. The charge against the latter was subsequently dropped for lack of any corpus delicti. 14. By letter of 6 September 1997, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation requested the Prime Minister of Ukraine to expedite the criminal proceedings relating to the aircraft at issue. 15. On 16 August 1997 the case was sent to the Kyivsky District Court of Kharkiv (hereafter “the Kyivsky Court”) for trial proceedings. On 16 October 1997 the Kyivsky Court allowed the applicant company to join the criminal proceedings as a civil claimant. On an unspecified subsequent date the Ministry joined the proceedings as a civil respondent. 16. At a preparatory hearing on 1 December 1997 the Kyivsky Court held that further investigations were required and remitted the case to the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor’s Office (hereafter “the Prosecutor’s Office”), which filed an appeal against this decision. 17. On 20 January 1998 the Kharkiv Regional Court dismissed the prosecution’s appeal, holding inter alia: “The AN-72 aircraft, which constitutes material evidence, was unlawfully sold at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings, thereby prejudging any subsequent court decision. In view of the fact that [the applicant company’s] ownership of the AN-72 aircraft is not disputed by anyone and that this company has been admitted as a civil claimant in the proceedings, the investigating authorities should take measures, as provided by law, in order to fulfil the claim in kind or to secure an equivalent amount of money.” 18. The Deputy Prosecutor of the Kharkiv Region filed a protest (extraordinary appeal) against the Kyivsky Court’s decisions of 16 October 1997 and 1 December 1997. On 24 June 1998 the Presidium of the Kharkiv Regional Court dismissed this protest. As regards the decision of 16 October 1997, it found no reason to deny the applicant company the status of civil claimant in this criminal case. 19. On 1 July 1999, the Prosecutor’s Office submitted the case to the Kyivsky Court, which committed Mr I and Mr N for trial. 20. On 17 November 2000 the applicant company requested the Kyivsky Court to quash the investigator’s order of 14 December 1995 to put the aircraft up for sale or, alternatively, to impound the aircraft pending trial. On the same day, the Kyivsky Court dismissed the first request and – accepting the applicant company’s argument that operating the airplane would entail wear and tear and depreciate its value – accepted the request to impound the aircraft for the duration of the criminal proceedings. 21. On 20 February 2001 the Zaliznychny District Bailiffs’ Service of Kyiv arrested the aircraft which, at that time, was parked at Kyiv airport. However, according to a letter dated 30 March 2001 by the Head of this Bailiffs’ Service, the arrest could not be maintained as the aircraft had disappeared from its parking place at this airport. 22. On 2 April 2001 the Kyivsky Court ordered the Ministry of the Interior to inform the court of the whereabouts of the aircraft and to implement its seizure order of 17 November 2000. 23. On 3 April 2001 the Ministry of International Affairs of the Russian Federation filed a note with the Ministry of International Affairs of Ukraine, stating that it “would be grateful for the return as soon as practically possible of the AN-72 aircraft to [the applicant company]”. 24. On 22 May 2001 the Ministry of the Interior appealed against the seizure order of 17 November 2000 to the President of the Kharkiv Regional Court and requested its suspension pending the determination of the appeal. On 28 May 2001 the Kyivsky Court granted this request and suspended the enforcement of the seizure order. No further information about these appeal proceedings has been submitted by the applicant company. Apparently, the seizure order has never been implemented. 25. On 22 June 2001 the Kyivsky Court decided to disjoin the applicant company’s civil claim from the criminal case, considering that it would be more appropriate to determine it in civil proceedings. The applicant company appealed. 26. On 6 July 2001 the Kyivsky Court found that the pre-trial investigations were insufficient and remitted the case to the Prosecutor’s Office. The accused Mr N. appealed. 27. On 22 January 2002 the Kharkiv Regional Court examined both appeals. It upheld the Kyivsky Court’s decision to remit the case for additional investigations, but quashed the impugned decision of 22 June 2001 and reinstated the applicant company’s status as civil claimant in the criminal proceedings. 28. On 30 July 2002 the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor forwarded the case to the Chervonozavodsky District Court of Kharkiv (hereafter “the Chervonozavodsky Court”) for trial proceedings. 29. On 13 March 2003 the Chervonozavodsky Court accepted a request filed by the applicant company to seize the aircraft pending the trial proceedings. 30. In the course of a hearing held on 17 July 2003, the Ministry challenged the above seizure order on the ground that the law did not entitle a court to order a general seizure of State property, but only to order the owner to refrain from specified actions. The Chervonozavodsky Court held that there was no proof that the Ministry owned the impugned aircraft. In particular the sales contract was said to be lost and the license to operate the plane, issued by the Ministry of Defence, authorised a certain Ministry’s unit to use it, without any reference being made as to who was its owner. However, the court decided to quash its ruling of 13 March 2003 and prohibited the Ministry from disposing of the aircraft in any form whatsoever and from moving it outside the Zhuliany airport, where it was stationed at the material time. 31. In the meantime Mr I. died and the charge against him was dropped. 32. On 13 October 2004 the Chervonozavodsky Court acquitted Mr N, who by that time had become the sole defendant in the proceedings, on the ground of lack of corpus delicti (відсутність складу злочину). The court further held that that the investigating authorities’ decision to sell the aircraft was unlawful. Moreover, there was no cogent proof of the Ministry’s ownership of the aircraft. The aircraft, which thus remained the applicant’s property and an item of material evidence, could be disposed of by a court in a judgment on the criminal case. Based on these findings the Chervonozavodsky Court ordered that the aircraft be handed over to the applicant. It, however, found that it had no jurisdiction, in the criminal case, to entertain the applicant company’s claims for damages against the Ministry, the Enterprise, the USBU and the Customs. The prosecutor, the applicant company, the Ministry and Mr N. (who considered that he should have been acquitted for lack of any offence – відсутність події) filed appeals against this judgment. 33. On 31 March 2005 the Kharkiv Regional Court of Appeal (hereafter “the Court of Appeal”) decided not to entertain the prosecution’s appeal on the ground that it was not signed by the prosecutor who had participated in the proceedings before the first instance court. The appeals of the Ministry, the applicant and Mr N. were rejected as unsubstantiated. The same parties made cassation appeals. 34. On 11 April 2006 the Supreme Court quashed the decision of 31 March 2005 and remitted the case for fresh appellate hearing on the ground that the Court of Appeal’s refusal to entertain the prosecutor’s appeal had not been reasonable. 35. On 1 August 2006 the Court of Appeal granted the appeal of the prosecutor, quashed the judgment of 13 October 2004 and remitted the case to the Prosecutor’s Office for further pre-trial investigations. 36. The investigation in the case is still pending.","['6', 'P1']",['P1-1'],[],[],[],[],1
175,001-58219,ENG,FRA,CHAMBER,1998,CASE OF LAMBERT v. FRANCE,2,Violation of Art. 8;Not necessary to examine Art. 13;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings;Costs and expenses award - domestic proceedings,John Freeland;N. Valticos,"7. Mr Lambert, a French national born in 1957, lives at Buzet-sur-Tarn. 8. In the course of a judicial investigation into offences of theft, burglary, handling the proceeds of theft and aggravated theft, and unlawful possession of Class 4 weapons and ammunition, an investigating judge at Riom issued a warrant on 11 December 1991 instructing the gendarmerie to arrange for the telephone line of a certain R.B. to be tapped until 31 January 1992. 9. By means of standard-form written instructions (“soit transmis”) dated 31 January, 28 February and 30 March 1992, the investigating judge extended the duration of the telephone tapping until 29 February, 31 March and 31 May 1992 respectively. 10. As a result of this tapping and the interception of some of his conversations, the applicant was charged with handling the proceeds of aggravated theft; he was held in custody from 15 May to 30 November 1992, when he was released subject to judicial supervision. 11. In an application of 5 April 1993 the applicant’s lawyer applied to the Indictment Division of the Riom Court of Appeal for a ruling that the extensions of 31 January and 28 February 1992 were invalid, arguing that they had been ordered merely by standard-form written instructions without any reference to the offences which justified the telephone tapping, and that the four-month period which could have been authorised in the warrant of 11 December 1991 had expired on 11 April 1992. 12. In a judgment of 25 May 1993 the Riom Court of Appeal dismissed Mr Lambert’s application on the following grounds: “… by Articles 100, 100-1 and 100-2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure [see paragraph 15 below] taken together, decisions to intercept telecommunications messages must be in writing and contain all the information necessary for identifying the link to be monitored, the offence that justifies the interception and the duration of the interception, which must not exceed four months but may be extended subject to the same formal requirements and maximum duration. In the instant case it is beyond doubt that the warrant of 11 December 1991 complies with the requirements of the above-mentioned Articles in so far as it specifies the number of the link to be monitored, a duration of less than four months and the offences that justified interception, the criminal penalties for which were greater than two years’ imprisonment. It is also clear that the decisions to extend the duration of the interception, which were issued in standard-form instructions, were in writing and mentioned the number of the link concerned; that they are an extension of the original decision of 11 December 1991 and necessarily referred to it; and that the duration of their validity was less than four months. They thus comply with the requirements of Article 100-2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.” 13. The applicant appealed on a point of law against the judgment of 25 May 1993, arguing, as his only ground of appeal, that Article 8 of the Convention and Articles 100 et seq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure had been infringed because the extensions of the duration of the telephone tapping in issue, by means of standard-form written instructions, did not contain any reasons. 14. In a judgment of 27 September 1993 the Court of Cassation affirmed the decision appealed against and held that the applicant had “no locus standi to challenge the manner in which the duration of the monitoring of a third party’s telephone line was extended” and that accordingly “the grounds of appeal, which contest[ed] the grounds on which the Indictment Division [had] wrongly considered it must examine [the] objections of invalidity and subsequently dismissed them, [were] inadmissible”. 15. The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Law no. 91-646 of 10 July 1991 on the confidentiality of telecommunications messages) read as follows: Article 100 “In the case of a serious crime or other major offence attracting a sentence of at least two years’ imprisonment, the investigating judge may, where necessary for the investigation, order the interception, recording and transcription of telecommunications messages. Such operations shall be carried out under his authority and supervision. Decisions to intercept shall be in writing. They shall not constitute judicial decisions and no appeal shall lie against them.” Article 100-1 “Decisions made pursuant to Article 100 shall contain all the information necessary for identifying the link to be monitored, the offence that justifies the interception and the duration of the interception.” Article 100-2 “Such decisions shall be valid for a maximum duration of four months. Their validity may be extended only subject to the same procedural requirements and maximum duration.” Article 100-3 “The investigating judge or a senior detective (officier de police judiciaire) acting on his instructions may call upon any qualified official of any department or body under the authority or supervision of the Minister for Telecommunications, or any qualified official of an authorised network operator or provider of telecommunications services, for the purpose of installing monitoring equipment.” Article 100-4 “The investigating judge or the senior detective acting on his instructions shall draw up a report on each of the interception and recording operations. This report shall give the date and time of the beginning and end of each operation.” Article 100-5 “The investigating judge or the senior detective acting on his instructions shall transcribe messages useful for establishing the truth. A report of the transcription shall be drawn up and the transcription placed in the case file. Any messages in a foreign language shall be transcribed in French with the help of an interpreter called upon for this purpose.” Article 100-6 “The Public Prosecutor or Principal Public Prosecutor shall ensure that the recordings are destroyed when prosecution becomes time-barred. A formal report of the destruction shall be drawn up.” Article 100-7 “The telephone line of a member of Parliament or senator shall not be tapped unless and until the Speaker of the relevant House has been informed by the investigating judge. The home or office telephone lines of a member of the Bar shall not be tapped unless and until the chairman of the Bar has been informed by the investigating judge. Any interception carried out in breach of the requirements of this Article shall be null and void.” 16. Mr Lambert applied to the Commission on 8 February 1994. He alleged that the interception of certain telephone conversations which were used against him amounted to interference with his private life and correspondence, contrary to Article 8 of the Convention; he also maintained that he had not had an effective remedy in the Court of Cassation, contrary to Article 13 of the Convention. 17. The Commission declared the application (no. 23618/94) admissible on 2 September 1996. In its report of 1 July 1997 (Article 31), it expressed the opinion by twenty votes to twelve that there had been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention and by twenty-seven votes to five that it was unnecessary to consider the case under Article 13 of the Convention also. The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the two dissenting opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment. 18. In their memorial the Government submitted that “the application lodged by Mr Lambert should be dismissed”. 19. The applicant asked the Court to “hold that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the … Convention; award him 500,000 francs by way of just satisfaction”. 20. Mr Lambert submitted that the Court of Cassation’s decision to refuse him any standing to complain of the interception of some of his telephone conversations, on the ground that it was a third party’s line that had been tapped, had infringed Article 8 of the Convention, which provides: “1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.” 21. The Court points out that as telephone conversations are covered by the notions of “private life” and “correspondence” within the meaning of Article 8, the admitted measure of interception amounted to “interference by a public authority” with the exercise of a right secured to the applicant in paragraph 1 of that Article (see, among other authorities, the following judgments: Malone v. the United Kingdom, 2 August 1984, Series A no. 82, p. 30, § 64; Kruslin v. France and Huvig v. France, 24 April 1990, Series A no. 176-A and B, p. 20, § 26, and p. 52, § 25; Halford v. the United Kingdom, 25 June 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-III, pp. 1016–17, § 48; and Kopp v. Switzerland, 25 March 1998, Reports 1998II, p. 540, § 53). In this connection, it is of little importance that the telephone tapping in question was carried out on the line of a third party. The Government did not dispute this. 22. Such interference will contravene Article 8 unless it is “in accordance with the law”, pursues one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph 2 and furthermore is “necessary in a democratic society” in order to achieve them. 23. The expression “in accordance with the law” within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 requires, firstly, that the impugned measure should have some basis in domestic law; it also refers to the quality of the law in question, requiring that it should be accessible to the person concerned, who must moreover be able to foresee its consequences for him, and compatible with the rule of law. 24. The Court notes that the investigating judge ordered the telephone tapping in question on the basis of Articles 100 et seq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraphs 12 and 15 above). 25. The interference complained of therefore had a statutory basis in French law. 26. The second requirement which derives from the phrase “in accordance with the law” – the accessibility of the law – does not raise any problem in the instant case. 27. As to the “foreseeability of the law”, the Government maintained that following the Court’s judgments in the Kruslin and Huvig cases (see paragraph 21 above), the French legislature had remedied the omissions and weaknesses of domestic law on telephone tapping by adopting safeguards in respect of the persons whose telephones could be tapped, the duration of interception, the requirements for drawing up reports, and the communication or destruction of recordings. 28. The Court considers, as the Commission did, that Articles 100 et seq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure, inserted by the Law of 10 July 1991 on the confidentiality of telecommunications messages, lay down clear, detailed rules and specify with sufficient clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities (see the Kruslin and Huvig judgments cited above, pp. 24–25, §§ 35–36, and p. 56, §§ 34–35, respectively, and, as the most recent authority and mutatis mutandis, the Kopp judgment cited above, pp. 541–43, §§ 62–75). 29. The Court shares the opinion of the Government and the Commission and considers that the interference was designed to establish the truth in connection with criminal proceedings and therefore to prevent disorder. 30. It remains to be ascertained whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society” for achieving those objectives. Under the Court’s settled case-law, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the existence and extent of such necessity, but this margin is subject to European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court (see, mutatis mutandis, the Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 61, pp. 37–38, § 97, and the Barfod v. Denmark judgment of 22 February 1989, Series A no. 149, p. 12, § 28). 31. When considering the necessity of interference, the Court stated in its Klass and Others v. Germany judgment of 6 September 1978 (Series A no. 28, pp. 23 and 25–26, §§ 50, 54 and 55): “The Court must be satisfied that, whatever system of surveillance is adopted, there exist adequate and effective guarantees against abuse. This assessment has only a relative character: it depends on … [among other things] the kind of remedy provided by the national law. … It therefore has to be determined whether the procedures for supervising the ordering and implementation of the restrictive measures are such as to keep the ‘interference’ resulting from the contested legislation to what is ‘necessary in a democratic society’. … In addition, the values of a democratic society must be followed as faithfully as possible in the supervisory procedures if the bounds of necessity, within the meaning of Article 8 § 2, are not to be exceeded. One of the fundamental principles of a democratic society is the rule of law, which is expressly referred to in the Preamble to the Convention… The rule of law implies, inter alia, that an interference by the executive authorities with an individual’s rights should be subject to an effective control…” 32. The applicant said that he had wished to complain of the circumstances in which the investigating judge had ordered the extensions of the duration of the telephone tapping (see paragraph 13 above), but the Court of Cassation’s decision had deprived him of any practical possibility of using the remedies provided by law to penalise irregularities committed by the authorities. 33. In the Government’s submission, the interference complained of had been “necessary in a democratic society”. In the instant case the telephone tapping had been one of the principal means of investigation contributing to the establishment of the truth and, in particular, to proving the involvement of various individuals, including the applicant, in large-scale illicit dealing in furniture. Furthermore, Mr Lambert had been able to avail himself of a remedy in the Indictment Division, and a further remedy in the Court of Cassation was quite unnecessary to satisfy the requirement of “effective control”. 34. The Court must accordingly ascertain whether an “effective control” was available to Mr Lambert to challenge the telephone tapping to which he had been made subject. 35. It notes, firstly, that the Court of Cassation in its judgment of 27 September 1993 held that the applicant had “no locus standi to challenge the manner in which the duration of the monitoring of a third party’s telephone line was extended” and that accordingly “the grounds of appeal, which contest[ed] the grounds on which the Indictment Division [had] wrongly considered it must examine [the] objections of invalidity and subsequently dismissed them, [were] inadmissible”. 36. In its ruling the Court of Cassation therefore went beyond the ground relied on by the applicant concerning the extension of the duration of the telephone tapping and held that a victim of the tapping of a telephone line not his own has no standing to invoke the protection of national law or Article 8 of the Convention. It concluded that in the instant case the Indictment Division had been wrong to examine the objections of invalidity raised by the applicant as the telephone line being monitored had not been his own. 37. Admittedly, the applicant had been able to avail himself of a remedy in respect of the disputed point in the Indictment Division, which held that the investigating judge’s extension of the duration of the telephone tapping had been in accordance with Articles 100 et seq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 12 above), and it is not the Court’s function to express an opinion on the interpretation of domestic law, which is primarily for the national courts to interpret (see the Kruslin and Huvig judgments cited above, p. 21, § 29, and p. 53, § 28, respectively). However, the Court of Cassation, the guardian of national law, criticised the Indictment Division for having examined the merits of Mr Lambert’s application. 38. As the Court has already said (see paragraph 28 above), the provisions of the Law of 1991 governing telephone tapping satisfy the requirements of Article 8 of the Convention and those laid down in the Kruslin and Huvig judgments. However, it has to be recognised that the Court of Cassation’s reasoning could lead to decisions whereby a very large number of people are deprived of the protection of the law, namely all those who have conversations on a telephone line other than their own. That would in practice render the protective machinery largely devoid of substance. 39. That was the case with the applicant, who did not enjoy the effective protection of national law, which does not make any distinction according to whose line is being tapped (Articles 100 et seq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure – see paragraph 15 above). 40. The Court therefore considers, like the Commission, that the applicant did not have available to him the “effective control” to which citizens are entitled under the rule of law and which would have been capable of restricting the interference in question to what was “necessary in a democratic society”. 41. There has consequently been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention. 42. The applicant also alleged a violation of Article 13 of the Convention, which provides: “Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.” 43. In view of the preceding conclusion (see paragraph 41 above), the Court does not consider that it need rule on the complaint in question. 44. Article 50 of the Convention provides: “If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.” 45. Mr Lambert sought 500,000 French francs (FRF) for non-pecuniary damage. 46. The Government considered that any finding of a violation would constitute sufficient just satisfaction. 47. The Delegate of the Commission expressed no view on the matter. 48. The Court considers that the applicant undeniably sustained non-pecuniary damage and awards him the sum of FRF 10,000 under this head. 49. The applicant also claimed FRF 15,000 in respect of the costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings before the Court. 50. The Government considered that the amount claimed was not unreasonable and wished to leave the matter to the Court’s discretion. 51. The Delegate of the Commission did not express a view. 52. Making its assessment on an equitable basis and with reference to its usual criteria, the Court awards the sum claimed. 53. According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in France at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 3.36% per annum.

The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Hamburg (Germany). 11. On 8 September 1992 Mr S. was fatally injured by a shot fired at a travellers' encampment (campo nomadi) in Rome. The initial statements taken by the police from witnesses indicated that the applicant had been responsible for the killing. 12. On 15 October 1992 the Rome investigating judge made an order for the applicant's detention pending trial. However, the order could not be enforced as the applicant had become untraceable. As a result, the Italian authorities considered that he had deliberately sought to evade justice and on 14 November 1992 declared him to be a “fugitive” (latitante). The applicant was identified as Cloce (or Kroce) Sejdovic (or Sajdovic), probably born in Titograd on 5 August 1972, the son of Jusuf Sejdovic (or Sajdovic) and the brother of Zaim (ou Zain) Sejdovic (or Sajdovic). 13. As the Italian authorities had not managed to contact the applicant to invite him to choose his own defence counsel, they assigned him a lawyer, who was informed that his client and four other persons had been committed for trial on a specified date in the Rome Assize Court. 14. The lawyer took part in the trial, but the applicant was absent. 15. In a judgment of 2 July 1996, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 30 September 1996, the Rome Assize Court convicted the applicant of murder and illegally carrying a weapon and sentenced him to twenty-one years and eight months' imprisonment. One of the applicant's fellow defendants was sentenced to fifteen years and eight months' imprisonment for the same offences, while the other three were acquitted. 16. The applicant's lawyer was informed that the Assize Court's judgment had been deposited with the registry. He did not appeal. The applicant's conviction accordingly became final on 22 January 1997. 17. On 22 September 1999 the applicant was arrested in Hamburg by the German police under an arrest warrant issued by the Rome public prosecutor's office. On 30 September 1999 the Italian Minister of Justice requested the applicant's extradition. He added that, once he had been extradited to Italy, the applicant would be entitled to apply under Article 175 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for leave to appeal out of time against the Rome Assize Court's judgment. 18. At the request of the German authorities, the Rome public prosecutor's office stated that it did not appear from the evidence that the applicant had been officially notified of the charges against him. The public prosecutor's office was unable to say whether the applicant had contacted the lawyer assigned to represent him. In any event, the lawyer had attended the trial and had played an active role in conducting his client's defence, having called a large number of witnesses. Furthermore, the Rome Assize Court had clearly established that the applicant, who had been identified by numerous witnesses as Mr S.'s killer, was guilty. In the opinion of the public prosecutor's office, the applicant had absconded immediately after Mr S.'s death precisely to avoid being arrested and tried. Lastly, the public prosecutor's office stated: “A person who is to be extradited may seek leave to appeal against the judgment. However, for a court to agree to re-examine the case it has to be proved that the accused was wrongly deemed to be a 'fugitive'. To sum up, a new trial, even in the form of an appeal (during which new evidence may be submitted), is not granted automatically.” 19. On 6 December 1999 the German authorities refused the Italian government's extradition request on the ground that the requesting country's domestic legislation did not guarantee with sufficient certainty that the applicant would have the opportunity of having his trial reopened. 20. In the meantime, the applicant had been released on 22 November 1999. He has never lodged an objection to execution (incidente d'esecuzione) or an application for leave to appeal out of time (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below) in Italy. 21. The validity of a conviction may be contested by means of an objection to execution under Article 670 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (“the CCP”), the relevant parts of which provide: “Where the judge supervising enforcement establishes that a judgment is invalid or has not become enforceable, he shall, [after] assessing on the merits [nel merito] whether the safeguards in place for a convicted person deemed to be untraceable have been observed, ... suspend its enforcement, ordering, where necessary, that the person be released and that defects in the service of process be remedied. In such cases the time allowed for appealing shall begin to run again.” 22. Article 175 §§ 2 and 3 of the CCP provides for the possibility of applying for leave to appeal out of time. The relevant parts of that provision were worded as follows at the time of the applicant's arrest: “In the event of conviction in absentia ..., the defendant may request the reopening of the time allowed for appeal against the judgment where he can establish that he had no effective knowledge [effettiva conoscenza] [of it] ... [and] on condition that no appeal has been lodged by his lawyer and there has been no negligence on his part or, in the case of a conviction in absentia having been served ... on his lawyer ..., that he did not deliberately refuse to take cognisance of the procedural steps. A request for the reopening of the time allowed for appeal must be lodged within ten days of the date ... on which the defendant learned [of the judgment], failing which it shall be declared inadmissible.” 23. When called upon to interpret this provision, the Court of Cassation has held that the rejection of an application for leave to appeal out of time cannot be justified by mere negligence or lack of interest on the defendant's part but that, on the contrary, there must have been “intentional conduct designed to avoid taking cognisance of the procedural steps” (see the First Section's judgment of 6 March 2000 (no. 1671) in Collini, and also the Court of Cassation's judgment no. 5808/1999). More specifically, where a judgment has been served on the accused in person, the accused must prove that he or she was unaware of it and that there has been no negligence on his or her part; however, where the judgment has been served on an absent defendant's lawyer, it is for the court to establish whether the defendant deliberately avoided taking cognisance of the relevant steps (see the Second Section's judgment of 29 January 2003 (no. 18107) in Bylyshi, where the Court of Cassation set aside an order in which the Genoa Court of Appeal had held that negligence could only be due to the wish not to receive any information, thereby treating negligent conduct as intentional without giving any arguments in support of that position). 24. In its judgment of 25 November 2004 (no. 48738) in Soldati, the Court of Cassation (First Section) observed that leave to appeal out of time could be granted on two conditions: if the accused had not had any knowledge of the proceedings and if he or she had not deliberately avoided taking cognisance of the procedural steps. It was for the convicted person to prove that the first condition was satisfied, whereas the burden of proof in respect of the second lay with the “representative of the prosecution or with the court”. Accordingly, a lack of evidence as regards the second condition could only work to the defendant's advantage. The Court of Cassation accordingly held that, before declaring defendants to be “fugitives”, the authorities should not only search for themthey had intentionally avoided complying with a measure ordered by the court, such as a measure entailing deprivation of liberty (see the First Section's judgment of 23 February 2005 (no. 6987) in Flordelis and Pagnanelli). 25. On 22 April 2005 Parliament approved Law no. 60/2005, by which Legislative Decree no. 17 of 21 February 2005 became statute. Law no. 60/2005 was published in Official Gazette (Gazzetta ufficiale) no. 94 of 23 April 2005. It came into force the following day. 26. Law no. 60/2005 amended Article 175 of the CCP. The new version of paragraph 2 reads as follows: “In the event of conviction in absentia ... the time allowed for appeal against the judgment shall be reopened, on an application by the defendant, unless he had effective knowledge [effettiva conoscenza] of the proceedings [against him] or of the judgment [provvedimento] and has deliberately refused to appear or to appeal against the judgment. The judicial authorities shall carry out all necessary checks to that end.” 27. Law no. 60/2005 also added a paragraph 2 bis to Article 175 of the CCP, worded as follows: “An application referred to in paragraph 2 above must be lodged within thirty days of the date on which the defendant had effective knowledge of the judgment, failing which it shall be declared inadmissible. In the event of extradition from another country, the time allowed for making such an application shall run from the point at which the defendant is handed over [to the Italian authorities] ...” 28. In Recommendation No. R (2000) 2 on the re-examination or reopening of certain cases at domestic level following judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe encouraged the Contracting Parties “to examine their national legal systems with a view to ensuring that there exist adequate possibilities of re-examination of the case, including reopening of proceedings, in instances where the Court has found a violation of the Convention, especially where: (i) the injured party continues to suffer very serious negative consequences because of the outcome of the domestic decision at issue, which are not adequately remedied by the just satisfaction and cannot be rectified except by re-examination or reopening, and (ii) the judgment of the Court leads to the conclusion that (a) the impugned domestic decision is on the merits contrary to the Convention, or (b) the violation found is based on procedural errors or shortcomings of such gravity that a serious doubt is cast on the outcome of the domestic proceedings complained of.”",['6'],[],[],[],[],[],1
177,001-57945,ENG,AUT,CHAMBER,1995,CASE OF SCHMAUTZER v. AUSTRIA,3,Violation of Art. 6-1 (access);Not necessary to examine Art. 6-1 (publicly);Pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses partial award - domestic proceedings;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings,John Freeland,"6. On 30 April 1986 Mr Peter Schmautzer was stopped by the police while driving his car. He was not wearing his safety-belt. In a ""sentence order"" (Straferkenntnis) of 1 June 1987 the federal police authority (Bundespolizeidirektion) in Graz imposed on him a fine of 300 Austrian schillings (ATS) with twenty-four hours' imprisonment in default of payment, for an offence under section III(1) and (5)(a) of the third amendment to the Motor Vehicles Act (Kraftfahrgesetz - see paragraph 10 below). 7. The applicant appealed against that decision to the Styria regional government (Amt der Landesregierung), which upheld the decision on 2 February 1988 but reduced the fine to ATS 200 and the penalty in default to fourteen hours' imprisonment. 8. On 6 April 1988 the applicant applied to the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof). He complained of an infringement of the principle that all citizens are equal before the law and alleged that his being sentenced to imprisonment in default by an administrative authority that was not an ""independent and impartial"" tribunal breached Articles 5 and 6 (art. 5, art. 6) of the Convention. He also argued that the requirement to wear a safety-belt was an interference in his private life, contrary to Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention. On 27 February 1989, at the conclusion of a consideration of the case in private, the Constitutional Court declined to accept the appeal for adjudication (Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal Constitution (Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz) - see paragraph 12 below), since, in view of its case-law on Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, it did not have sufficient prospects of success; moreover, the case did not lie outside the jurisdiction of the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof). At Mr Schmautzer's request, it also decided to refer the application to the Administrative Court. 9. On 20 September 1989 the Administrative Court stayed the proceedings before it as Mr Schmautzer's application did not satisfy the substantive and formal requirements of section 34(2) of the Administrative Court Act (Verwaltungsgerichtshofsgesetz - see paragraph 14 below). 10. Section III of the 1976 Act as amended in 1984, which amended the Motor Vehicles Act 1967 (Kraftfahrgesetz), provides: ""1. Where a seat in a motor vehicle is equipped with asafety-belt as required by the Motor Vehicles Act, the driver andpassengers occupying such a seat must wear the safety-belt in theconventional manner (bestimmungsgemäß) ... ... 5. It shall be an administrative offence ... punishable, in a sentence order without a hearing (Organstrafverfügung) pursuant to section 50 of the Administrative Criminal Justice Act 1950,with a fine of ATS 100 for (a) the driver of a motor vehicle or (b) a passenger in a motor vehicle not to comply with the requirement in subsection (1), first sentence. In the event of refusal to pay the ... fine, the authority may impose a fine of up to ATS 300, with up to twenty-four hours' imprisonment in default of payment. ..."" 11. Article 90 para. 1 of the Federal Constitution (Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz) provides: ""Hearings by trial courts in civil and criminal cases shall be oral and public. Exceptions may be prescribed by law."" 12. By Article 144 para. 1 of the Federal Constitution the Constitutional Court, when an application (Beschwerde) is made to it, has to determine whether an administrative decision (Bescheid) has infringed a right guaranteed by the Constitution or has applied regulations (Verordnung) contrary to the law, a law contrary to the Constitution or an international treaty incompatible with Austrian law. Article 144 para. 2 provides: ""Up to the time of the hearing the Constitutional Court may by means of a decision (Beschluß) decline to accept a case for adjudication if it does not have sufficient prospects of success or if it cannot be expected that the judgment will clarify an issue of constitutional law. The court may not decline to accept for adjudication a case excluded from the jurisdiction of the Administrative Court by Article 133."" 13. By Article 130 para. 1 of the Federal Constitution, the Administrative Court has jurisdiction to hear, inter alia, applications alleging that an administrative decision is unlawful. 14. Section 34(2) of the Administrative Court Act (Verwaltungsgerichtshofsgesetz) provides: ""Applications which are not barred by any of the circumstances set out in subsection (1), but fail to satisfy the conditions as to form and content laid down in sections 23, 24, 28 and 29, must be adjourned for a brief period to enable their defects to be remedied (Behebung der Mängel); applications not rectified within the time-limit shall be deemed to have been withdrawn."" 15. Section 39(1) provides, in particular, that at the end of the preliminary proceedings (Vorverfahren) the Administrative Court must hold a hearing where the applicant makes a request to that effect. Section 39(2) reads as follows: ""Notwithstanding a party's application under subsection (1), the Administrative Court may decide not to hold a hearing where 1. the proceedings must be stayed (section 33) or the application dismissed (section 34); 2. the impugned decision must be quashed as unlawful because the respondent authority lacked jurisdiction (section 42(2)(2)); 3. the impugned decision must be quashed as unlawful on account of a breach of procedural rules (section 42(2)(3)); 4. the impugned decision must be quashed because its content is unlawful according to the established case-law of the Administrative Court; 5. neither the respondent authority nor any other party before the court has filed pleadings in reply and the impugned decision is to be quashed; 6. it is apparent to the court from the pleadings of the parties to the proceedings before it and from the files relating to the earlier administrative proceedings that a hearing is not likely to clarify the case further."" Sub-paragraphs 1 to 3 of section 39(2) were in force in 1958; sub-paragraphs 4 and 5 were inserted in 1964 and sub-paragraph 6 in 1982. 16. Section 41(1) of the Administrative Court Act provides: ""In so far as the Administrative Court does not find any unlawfulness deriving from the respondent authority's lack of jurisdiction or from breaches of procedural rules (section 42(2)(2) and (3)) ..., it must examine the impugned decision on the basis of the facts found by the respondent authority and with reference to the complaints put forward ... If it considers that reasons which have not yet been notified to one of the parties might be decisive for ruling on [one of these complaints] ..., it must hear the parties on this point and adjourn the proceedings if necessary."" 17. Section 42(1) of the same Act states that, save as otherwise provided, the Administrative Court must either dismiss an application as ill-founded or quash the impugned decision. By section 42(2), ""The Administrative Court shall quash the impugned decision if it is unlawful 1. by reason of its content, [or] 2. because the respondent authority lacked jurisdiction, [or] 3. on account of a breach of procedural rules, in that (a) the respondent authority has made findings of fact which are, in an important respect, contradicted by the case file, or (b) the facts require further investigation on an important point, or (c) procedural rules have been disregarded, compliance with which could have led to a different decision by the respondent authority."" 18. If the Administrative Court quashes the impugned decision, ""the administrative authorities [are] under a duty ... to take immediate steps, using the legal means available to them, to bring about in the specific case the legal situation which corresponds to the Administrative Court's view of the law (Rechtsanschauung)"" (section 63(1)). 19. In a judgment of 14 October 1987 (G 181/86) the Constitutional Court held: ""From the fact that it has been necessary to extend the reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention to cover the procedural safeguards of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, because of the connection between those two provisions (art. 5, art. 6), it follows that, conversely, the limited review (die (bloß) nachprüfende Kontrolle) carried out by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court is insufficient in respect of criminal penalties within the meaning of the Convention that are not covered by the reservation."" 20. Pursuant to Article 129 of the Federal Constitution, administrative courts called ""independent administrative tribunals"" (Unabhängige Verwaltungssenate) were set up in the Länder with effect from 1 January 1991. The functions of these tribunals include determining both the factual and the legal issues arising in cases concerning administrative offences (Verwaltungsübertretungen). 21. The instrument of ratification of the Convention deposited by the Austrian Government on 3 September 1958 contains, inter alia, a reservation worded as follows: ""The provisions of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention shall be so applied that there shall be no interference with the measures for the deprivation of liberty prescribed in the laws on administrative procedure, BGBl [Federal Official Gazette] No. 172/1950, subject to review by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court as provided for in the Austrian Federal Constitution.""",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

BULGARIA,3,Remainder inadmissible;No violation of Art. 3 (substantive aspect);Violation of Art. 3 (procedural aspect);Non-pecuniary damage - award,George Nicolaou;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Nicolas Bratza;Päivi Hirvelä;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"5. The applicants were born in 1967, 1968 and 1998 respectively and live in Burgas. 6. Around 1 p.m. on 17 February 2004 someone rang the door bell of the applicants’ apartment. At that time inside the apartment were the first, second and third applicants and the second applicant’s mother, Mrs. D.Zh. 7. Mrs D.Zh. opened the door, following which a group of several masked police officers went in and arrested the first applicant. 8. Subsequently, it was established that the police officers were from the Central Service for Combating Organised Crime (“the CSCOC”) of the Ministry of the Interior and were conducting an operation to investigate individuals suspected of the forging of banknotes. 9. The applicants alleged that the police officers had kicked and beaten the first applicant and threatened the second and third applicants with a gun, shouting that they would kill everybody. The Government disputed these allegations. 10. After the first applicant was arrested and handcuffed, Mrs I.K., an officer from the CSCOC, arrived at the scene. 11. At about 1.30 p.m. the applicants’ lawyer, Mr D.K., and a colleague of his, Mr G. B., also went to the applicants’ apartment but were apparently refused access. 12. At about 2.30 p.m. Mr M.M., an investigator from the Burgas Regional Investigation Service (“the BRIS”) arrived at the scene in order to carry out a search of the applicants’ apartment. The first and second applicants and two certifying witnesses (поемни лица) were present during the search. At about 4 p.m. a prosecutor from the appellate public prosecutor’s office and the director of the BRIS also arrived. 13. The search ended around 5.30 p.m. 14. Immediately after that the police officers took the first applicant to the BRIS where he was charged with aiding and abetting the forging of banknotes and with an attempt to put forged banknotes into circulation. He was remanded in custody. 15. On 18 February 2004 the prison doctor examined the first applicant and noted in the medical register of detained persons (aмбулаторен дневник) that the applicant was healthy. He did not make a note of any bruises or injuries on the applicant’s body. The first applicant was again examined by the prison doctor on 17, 19 and 22 March and 16 April 2004 in connection with hypertonic crisis, for which he was prescribed medication. It appears that on 22 March 2004 an unspecified part of the first applicant’s body was bandaged. It is not clear why this was done. 16. On 23 April 2004 the first applicant was examined by specialists from a civilian hospital (see paragraph 18 below). 17. On 15 April 2004 the first applicant filed an application with the prison authorities stating that during his arrest on 17 February 2004 he had been beaten by police officers and had not been feeling well since then; in particular, he was suffering from headaches, dizziness and pain in the ears. He requested a medical examination by civilian doctors. 18. The request was granted, following which on 23 April 2004 the first applicant was examined in a civilian hospital. The doctors concluded that he was suffering from high blood pressure. The doctors did not note any bruises or injuries on his body. 19. Meanwhile, on 11 April 2004 the second applicant lodged a complaint about the incident with the Sliven regional military prosecutor’s office. She stated that at about 1 p.m. on 17 February 2004 someone had rung the doorbell of the applicants’ apartment. Mrs D.Zh., who had also been residing there, had opened the door and a group of masked police officers had rushed in. The first applicant had come out into the corridor, where he had been knocked down by the police officers. The second applicant had heard shouts and screaming. She had come out into the corridor and had seen that the first applicant was lying on the floor while the police officers were punching and kicking him. The third applicant, five years old at the time, was screaming. One of the police officers had pointed a gun at the second and third applicants and shouted: “Shut up or I will shoot you! Take this child away from here! Make her shut up!” The police officer had blue eyes and a blond moustache. Mrs D.Zh. had started screaming and a female police officer with blond hair and blue eyes had threatened to beat her up. 20. The complaint was received on 15 April 2004 and on an unspecified date thereafter an investigation was opened. 21. During the investigation Mr M.M. and officers from the detention centre were questioned, the case file of the criminal proceedings against the first applicant was examined and information about the relevant entries in the medical register of the detained persons was gathered. There is no evidence that other State officials who had been present when the incident took place were questioned. None of the police officers who had entered the applicants’ apartment and effected the first applicant’s arrest was ever interviewed. Neither the applicants, nor any independent witnesses appear to have been questioned. 22. In a statement given in the course of the investigation, Mr M.M., the investigator with the BRIS, stated that, following orders to carry out a search in the applicants’ apartment, he had arrived there at about 2.30 p.m. The front door of the apartment had been open. Inside the apartment Mr M.M. had seen the first applicant, who was handcuffed and was being guarded by two or three police officers. Two other police officers, two certifying witnesses and the second applicant were present. Mr M.M. had not seen the second applicant’s mother, or the third applicant. Nor had he seen signs of a fight or violence in the apartment or on the first applicant’s face, body or clothes. The first and second applicants had not complained about any ill-treatment. At about 4 p.m. a prosecutor from the appellate public prosecutor’s office and the director of the BRIS had arrived at the scene. 23. In an order of 29 November 2004 a prosecutor from the Sliven regional military prosecutor’s office refused to open criminal proceedings (предварително производство), noting that the police officers had been carrying out a special operation for the arrest of members of an organised criminal group and that there was no evidence that the police officers had used unnecessary force and threats against the applicants. 24. The second applicant appealed, requesting, inter alia, the questioning of Mrs D.Zh. and a neighbour, Mrs D.N., who had allegedly witnessed the incident, the examination of the register for detained persons, where, according to her, the first applicant’s bruises had been noted, and the commissioning of medical expert opinions. She submitted medical documents dated 19 March, 26 March and 13 May 2004 proving that she, her son and daughter, the third applicant, were suffering from stress disorders. 25. The prosecutor from the Sliven regional military prosecutor’s office dealing with the case forwarded the appeal to the Sofia military appellate prosecutor’s office and prepared a report on its merits. In this report, dated 27 December 2004 and addressed to the appellate prosecutor’s office, he proposed that the appeal be dismissed and the criminal proceedings discontinued for lack of sufficient evidence. 26. In particular, he considered that the medical documents concerning the stress disorder of the second and third applicants could not be regarded as evidence of ill-treatment and did not prove that a causal link between their condition and the events of 17 February 2004 existed. He also noted that the allegations that the first applicant had been beaten had not been proved because, first, the applicants had not complained about ill-treatment before the investigators or the prosecutor present during the search and, second, on 18 February 2004 the prison doctor had noted in the medical register that the first applicant had been healthy. As to the request for the questioning of witnesses, the prosecutor considered that Mrs D.Zh.’s testimony would not contribute to the establishment of the true facts and that there was no indication that Mrs D.N. had witnessed the events. He also considered that the applicants had not substantiated the relevance of the copy of the register of detained persons and, therefore, this request should be rejected. 27. On 5 January 2005 a prosecutor from the Sofia military appellate prosecutor’s office upheld the refusal to open a preliminary investigation. He noted, without specifying any further details, that during the first applicant’s arrest the police officers had used physical force and other means of restraint (помощни средства). Nevertheless, he found that there was insufficient evidence of an offence. 28. The second applicant appealed further. 29. On 4 April 2005 a prosecutor from the Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office held that the police officers had indeed imposed some restrictions on the applicants, such as to forbid contact between them and restrict their free movement. These restrictions, however, had been necessary in order to carry out the search. The applicants had not complained about the alleged ill-treatment to the prosecutor or to the investigators who had been present at the search but had instead lodged their official complaint two months after the incident. He found that no excess of power or evidence of an offence had been established and therefore refused to open criminal proceedings. In respect of the complaints about the alleged ill-treatment of the first applicant, the prosecutor rejected the appeal without examining its merits as it had not been lodged by the first applicant himself. 30. The first and second applicants appealed to the Chief Public Prosecutor. 31. On 28 May 2005 a prosecutor from the Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office refused to open criminal proceedings on account of a lack of sufficient evidence of an offence. 32. At a hearing on 14 October 2004, held in the course of the criminal proceedings against the first applicant, Mrs I.K, an officer from the CSCOC who had been present at the incident, stated that by the time she had arrived at the scene, other police officers had already arrested the first applicant, who at the moment of her arrival had been lying on the floor while being handcuffed. Thereafter, the police officers had lifted him from the floor and let him sit down. She contended that she had not seen any of the police officers hit the first applicant; nor had she noticed bruises or injuries on him. She had not been aware of the allegations that injuries on the first applicant’s body had been noted in the register for detained persons. It appears that these statements were made in connection with contentions made by the first applicant in the course of the criminal proceedings against him that he had been ill-treated during his arrest on 17 February 2004. 33. On the same day, another officer from the CSCOC, Mr K.M., testified before the trial court. His testimony did not concern the events of 17 February 2004. 34. On 17 February 2004 the applicant was remanded in custody on suspicion of aiding and abetting the forgery of banknotes and of attempting to put forged banknotes into circulation. 35. On 20 May 2004 he was released on bail. 36. By a judgment of 30 March 2005 the Burgas Regional Curt found the first applicant guilty as charged. It sentenced him to six years’ imprisonment and confiscated the mobile phone he had used for arranging meetings with accomplices and potential clients. 37. The first applicant appealed, claiming, inter alia, procedural breaches, including the refusal of the domestic court to provide him with a translation of a fax from the US secret services which had allegedly been admitted as evidence and mentioned in the judgment. The Burgas Court of Appeal dismissed this request at a hearing on 25 March 2005, finding that the fax had not been included as evidence in the case file. 38. On 13 February 2006 the Burgas Court of Appeal upheld the previous court’s judgment, finding no procedural breaches. 39. The first applicant, who had been legally represented throughout the proceedings, appealed further. 40. By a final judgement of 29 March 2007, the Supreme Court of Cassation acquitted him on the charges of attempting to put forged banknotes into circulation and therefore did not examine his arguments in connection with these charges. It upheld the conviction on the remainder of the charges and the sentence. 41. The applicant submits that he became aware of the final judgment only on 5 April 2007, when the case file was returned to the Burgas Regional Court and placed at his disposal at the court’s registry. 42. Section 78 of the Ministry of the Interior Act of 1997, in force until 1 May 2006, provided that police officers may use force when performing their duties only if they had no alternative course of action in cases of, inter alia, resistance or refusal to obey a lawful order, arrest of an offender who did not obey or resisted a police officer, and attacks against citizens and police officers. Pursuant to section 79(2), the use of force had to be commensurate with, in particular, the specific circumstances and the personality of the offender. Section 79(3) imposed a duty on police officers to protect, wherever possible, the health of the persons against whom force was being used. Section 79(5) forbade the use of physical force against minors. 43. Article 12a of the Criminal Code provides that causing harm to a person while arresting them for an offence is not punishable where no other means of effecting the arrest exists and the force used is necessary and lawful. The force used will not be considered “necessary” where it is manifestly disproportionate to the nature of the offence committed by the person to be arrested or is in itself excessive and unnecessary. 44. Instruction no. I-167/2003 of 23 July 2003, in force between 2003 and February 2007, governed the procedures for detention in custody. Section 2 of the Instruction provided that in the performance of their duties the police organs were under an obligation to respect detainees’ human rights in accordance with the Bulgarian Constitution and the Convention. Section 8 of the Instruction provided that when performing their duties police officers may use force only in accordance with the provisions of the Ministry of the Interior Act. Acts of inhuman or degrading treatment, torture or discrimination were strictly forbidden (section 9). If a police officer witnessed such an act, he or she was under an obligation to prevent its continuation and to inform his or her superior (section 10). 45. Section 159(3) of the Ministry of the Interior Act of 1997 provided that the identity of members of the Specialised Anti-terrorism Squad could not be disclosed. At the material time there were no such provisions in place in respect of members of the CSCOC or other police officers. 46. The new Ministry of the Interior Act, in force from 1 May 2006, provides that the identity of police officers whose duties include taking part in operations aimed at liberating hostages and/or neutralising or arresting persons suspected of having committed particularly dangerous offences must not be revealed (section 91(3)). The Regulations for the Act’s implementation provide that the identity of the members of the Specialised Anti-Terrorism Squad, whose duties include carrying out operations under section 91 of the Act, cannot be disclosed (section 136(2), later superseded by section 150 т (2)). 47. Pursuant to Articles 128, 129 and 130 of the Criminal Code, causing minor, moderate or severe bodily harm to another person is a criminal offence. Article 131 § 1 (2) provides that if the injury is caused by a police officer in the course of, or in connection with, the performance of his or her duties, the offence is an aggravated one. This offence is a publicly prosecutable one. With the exception of threats (Article 144 of the Criminal Code) Bulgarian law does not provide for the criminalisation as such of acts giving rise to psychological suffering. 48. Persons claiming that they have been ill-treated by police officers can seek damages under the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act (“the SMRDA”) of 1988. The remedy is described in more detail in the Court’s judgment in the case of Krastanov v. Bulgaria (no. 50222/99, §§ 45-46, 30 September 2004).",['3'],[],[],['3'],[],[],1

BULGARIA,4,Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial,Isabelle Berro-Lefèvre;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Volodymyr Butkevych,"5. The applicants were born in 1930, 1925, 1920, 1920, 1926, 1931, 1934, 1931 and 1924 respectively. On 8 October 2002 the fourth applicant, Mr Milko Kalev Balev, passed away. By a letter of 10 April 2006 his wife, Mrs Maria Vasileva Baleva and his sons, Mr Vladimir Milkov Balev and Mr Kalin Milkov Balev, informed the Court that they wished to continue the present application in his stead. The remaining applicants live in Sofia. 6. Prior to 1989 all nine applicants occupied leading positions in the Council of Ministers (the government) and the Bulgarian Communist Party (“the BCP”). 7. On 9 July 1992 the Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office opened preliminary investigation against twenty-two former members of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers and the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the BCP, including the nine applicants and Mr A. Lukanov and Mr O. Doinov, whose applications relating to the same criminal proceedings were decided by the European Court of Human Rights in 1997 and 2007 (Lukanov v. Bulgaria, judgment of 20 March 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997II, and Doinov v. Bulgaria, no.68356/01, 27 September 2007). On an unspecified date the applicants were charged with abuse of office and misappropriation on the ground that between 1981 and 1989 they had participated in the adoption of decisions to provide financial assistance or extend loans, totalling 243,537,000 old Bulgarian levs, to foreign countries and political parties. 8. Between July 1992 and February 1993 the prosecution authorities carried out a number of investigations. 9. After February 1993 the criminal proceedings were stayed for undetermined periods of time on at least four occasions. The last such occasion was on 28 May 1995. The proceedings were resumed on 15 June 1999. 10. By a decision of the Sofia city public prosecutor’s office of 28 January 2000 the criminal proceedings against the applicants were terminated. The prosecution found that the actions of the accused, including the nine applicants, had not been punishable under domestic criminal legislation at the time: the funds in question had been included as expenditure in the State budget, the decisions had been adopted without exceeding the powers granted to the accused under the existing legislation and the provision of such aid was in conformity with the State’s international obligations. Reference was made to this Court’s judgment in the case of Lukanov v. Bulgaria (cited above) where it had been concluded in respect of the same domestic proceedings that: “... no evidence has been adduced to show that such decisions were unlawful, that is to say contrary to Bulgaria’s Constitution or legislation, or more specifically that the decisions were taken in excess of powers or were contrary to the law on the national budget” (§ 43). 11. On 16 February and 27 March 2000 the decision of the Sofia city public prosecutor’s office to terminate the proceedings was upheld by the Sofia appellate public prosecutor’s office and the Sofia Court of Appeal, respectively. 12. Under the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act of 1988 (“the SMRDA”) individuals can in certain circumstances seek damages for unlawful acts of the authorities. The Act does not mention excessive length of proceedings as a ground for an action for damages. Nor is there any practice in the domestic courts of awarding damages for excessive length of proceedings.",['6'],[],[],[],[],[],1
180,001-100901,ENG,POL,COMMITTEE,2010,CASE OF STANISZEWSKI v. POLAND,4,Violation of Art. 6-1,Giovanni Bonello;Ján Šikuta;Lech Garlicki,"6. On 14 December 2006 the applicant lodged with the Kłodzko District Court an action against his former employer, concerning his social insurance entitlements. 7. On 26 April 2007 the Kłodzko District Court dismissed the applicant's action. 8. On 15 May 2007 the applicant appealed. On 23 October 2007 the Świdnica Regional Court dismissed his appeal. 9. On 5 November 2007 the applicant was served with the judgment with its written grounds. The court informed him at the same time that he had sixty days as of the date of the service of the judgment (until 5 January 2008) to lodge a cassation appeal. 10. In his letter of 28 December 2007, received by the court on 31 December 2007, the applicant requested the court to appoint a legalaid lawyer for the purposes of lodging a cassation appeal. 11. On 9 January 2008 the applicant was granted legal aid. In a letter of the same date the court requested the Wałbrzych Regional Bar Association to assign a legal-aid lawyer to the case. This letter was served on the addressee on 14 January 2008. A legal-aid lawyer was assigned to the case on the same day. 12. In his fax of 25 January 2008 to the Świdnica Regional Court the applicant requested the court to extend the statutory time limit for lodging the cassation appeal in his case. He explained that he had been trying to find a lawyer; to no avail. Finally, he stated that he was “delighted with the legal-aid lawyer assigned to his case, who was superb”. 13. In a letter of 24 January 2007 to the Świdnica Regional Court, the legal-aid lawyer stated that she had found no points of law on which a cassation appeal in the applicant's case could be based and submitted a legal opinion as to why a cassation appeal did not, in her view, offer any prospects of success. A copy of that letter was sent to the applicant on the next day. 14. In his letter of 30 January 2008, served on the Świdnica Regional Court on 1 February 2008, the applicant requested that the case be reexamined by that court. The applicant also applied to have the power of attorney of the defendant enterprise invalidated for the purpose of safeguarding the equality of arms in the proceedings as he intended to present his case to the court without legal representation. 15. By a letter of 28 February 2008 the President of the Labour Division of the Świdnica Regional Court informed the applicant that there were no grounds on which to envisage a re-examination of the case in which a final and valid judicial decision had been given. 16. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the procedure for lodging cassation appeals with the Supreme Court against judgments of the appellate courts are stated in the Court's judgments in the cases of Siałkowska v. Poland, no. 8932/05, 22 March 2007; Staroszczyk v. Poland, no. 59519/00, 22 March 2007; Smyk v. Poland, no. 8958/04, 28 July 2009; Zapadka v. Poland, no. 2619/05, 15 December 2009; Bąkowska v. Poland, no. 33539/02, 12 January 2010. 17. On 5 February 2005 amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure, adopted on 22 December 2004 (Ustawa o zmianie ustawy Kodeks postępowania cywilnego oraz ustawy Prawo o ustroju sądów powszechnych), entered into force. Under the amended text of Article 398 1 § 5, the timelimit for lodging a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court was extended from thirty to sixty days. 18. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a request for leave to appeal out of time was the only method by which a cassation appeal submitted after the expiry of the timelimit could be admitted for examination (21 April 1997, II CZ 38/97; 27 September 2001, II UZ 51/01). In a further series of decisions the Supreme Court considered that it would be unfair for the legally-aided party to be penalised for the fact that legalaid applications could not be processed quickly enough to make it possible for a cassation appeal to be lodged within a period of thirty days counted from the day of service of the judgment on the party. The parties waiting for legal-aid services cannot be held at fault for shortcomings in the system. A party who was obliged to have recourse to legal aid should not be put in a worse situation than that of a person who did not seek it. A request to appeal out of time should therefore be submitted within seven days from the date on which the legalaid lawyer could obtain effective access to the case file or had an effective possibility of drafting an appeal (4 March 2005, II UZ 72/04; 27 June 2000, I CZ 62/00), or from the date when the lawyer was informed that he had been assigned to the case by the local Bar Association (11 October 2001, IV CZ 163/01; 17 November 1998, II UZ 122/98; 11 October 2001, IV CZ 163/01); 19. In a resolution adopted by a bench of seven judges of the Supreme Court on 17 February 2009 (III CZP 117/08) that court acknowledged that there had been discrepancies in the manner in which the beginning of the seven-day time limit for submitting an application for leave to appeal out of time by legally-assisted parties had been determined. The court was of the view that applications for leave served the purpose of making access to the Supreme Court for legally-aided parties genuine and effective. Hence, the beginning of the timelimit could not be determined in a mechanical manner in all cases. The courts should instead examine the circumstances of individual cases as a whole and determine that date bearing in mind the genuine possibility for a lawyer to examine the case and prepare a cassation appeal.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Savona, Italy. 5. On 19 January 1998 the applicant entered Romania with a tourist visa valid until 2 February 1998 and started business activities. In February 1998, when the applicant requested extension of the visa, the authorities asked for proof of residence in Romania that she could not provide. 6. In February-March 1999 the authorities refused the applicant’s request for extension of her visa as out of time. They told her that she needed to “know people” who could help her receive a new visa. 7. On 29 April 2000 the applicant was questioned by two officers from the Bucharest police to whom she claims she gave a bribe of 100,000 Old Romanian Lei (ROL) to let her go. 8. On 4 May 2000 at 8.30 a.m. the applicant was again stopped by officers from the Bucharest police when she was on her way to the Italian consulate. The officers took her identity papers and verified her data. After a one-hour wait the applicant was taken to Police Precinct no. 19 for additional checks. 9. From Precinct no. 19 she was taken by three officers to the Passport Bureau, where she explained that her visa had not been extended before its expiry because she had not had a valid residential tenancy contract. The person in charge asked her to return the next day to have her situation regularised. 10. The applicant was made to wait in the police car with one of the officers while the other two officers checked her passport. After the check they returned to Precinct no. 19, where after a one-hour wait the applicant was taken to the basement and body-searched by a female police officer while her bag was searched by another officer. She was informed that that was the standard procedure for any person who entered the police headquarters. 11. After the search, the applicant was questioned by two officers from the Passport Bureau and then taken again to their headquarters. Her fingerprints and photograph were taken and she was put in a room where the commander of Precinct no. 19 was writing on a paper that he was hiding from the applicant with his hands. 12. The commander informed the applicant, who requested an explanation, that she was not allowed to ask questions, to read or to know anything, and that she had to sit in a corner and wait. He then told her to stop crying, because the treatment she was subjected to was not even comparable to that inflicted on Romanians arrested by the Italian police. The applicant replied that, unlike the great majority of Romanians in Italy, she had come to invest money in Romania and not to steal or commit crimes. She also said that the Italian police respected procedures, human rights and in particular the presumption of innocence, which was not the case in Romania, where foreigners were badly treated. 13. The applicant’s bag was searched again by another officer who entered the room. He took ROL 750,000 from her purse, the cost of a visa stamp that was applied on the applicant’s passport valid from 5 to 12 May 2000. He made an inventory of the bag and reported that the applicant had a mobile phone and ROL 2,250,000. 14. At around 4.30 p.m. the same day the applicant was taken for questioning to a different passport bureau. After a one-hour wait in the police car outside the building, she was informed that the questioning could not take place as the person in charge was absent, but that she would be taken to a hotel in Otopeni for the night. 15. Instead of being taken to a hotel as informed the applicant was placed in police custody. Her fingerprints were taken again and her money confiscated by the police officers, except for ROL 500,000 that she was allowed to keep for personal expenses. 16. The wardens informed her that she was to be repatriated the next day because she did not have a valid residence permit, but that since she had not committed any crimes in Romania she was free to return immediately. 17. On 5 May 2000 at 12 midday the applicant called the Italian consulate in Bucharest to ask the reasons for her arrest. The consulate was not aware of her situation. Later that day someone from the consulate staff informed the applicant that she was going to be repatriated to Italy on 7 May by the 9.10 a.m. Tarom flight but that they still did not know the reason for her arrest. 18. On 7 May 2000 the applicant was taken by a police officer to the airport where she was taken on to the flight by a Romanian intelligence officer who accompanied her throughout her journey to Italy. Asked by the applicant about the reasons for her repatriation, the officer told her that if she had not committed a crime it must be because of a quarrel with the police. He confirmed that the incident with the commander of the passport police team could have been the real reason for her repatriation. He also informed the applicant that she was under a prohibition on returning to Romania for two years. 19. In Rome the applicant was taken to the Italian police, who were not aware of her arrival. The police returned her passport and released her. 20. On 16 May 2000 the applicant’s husband, who was living in Romania in the same situation as the applicant, returned to Italy of his own free will. 21. The applicant’s residence permit was granted for the periods 29 April-29 October 1993 and 2 August 1997-2 February 1998. 22. According to the official records, the applicant was not arrested or remanded in police custody between 4 and 7 May 2000. 23. On 4 May 2000 the applicant was stopped by officers from Police Precinct no. 19 and taken to the Office for Foreigners in the Ministry of Interior, which was aware of the applicant’s irregular situation. 24. The Office for Foreigners filled in a standard form on the applicant’s situation under Law no. 25/1969. It recorded therein the dates of validity of her visa, the fact that she had been unlawfully resident for two years and three months and that she could not give reasons for her situation. It also noted that she was not married to a Romanian national nor did she have children of Romanian nationality and that she owned a company in Romania which had ceased trading. The Office for Foreigners recorded on the standard form that the applicant was not under criminal investigation in Romania, that no expulsion order had been made against her and that she had not asked for asylum. It also noted that the applicant had ROL 2,250,000 at her disposal. For these reasons, the Office decided that the applicant should be placed in the Otopeni Centre for Reception, Selection and Accommodation for Foreigners (“the Otopeni Centre”) with a view to her repatriation on the next flight to Rome. It ordered the purchase of a ticket to that end, at the authorities’ expense, and issued a prohibition on the applicant entering Romania for two years. It stamped on the applicant’s passport an exit visa valid from 5 to 12 May 2000. 25. She arrived at the Otopeni Centre on 4 May 2000 at 5 p.m. On arrival she was body-searched and the record indicated that she had ROL 1,160,000 at her disposal. 26. On 7 May 2000 the applicant was repatriated. An employee from the Airport Security Service accompanied her throughout her journey. This measure was taken in order to ensure security on the flight, given the applicant’s aggressive behaviour and her continual refusals to embark on the aeroplane. 27. On 8 June 2000 the applicant sent a letter to the Chamber of Deputies of the Romanian Parliament protesting against her repatriation. The letter was transmitted to the Border Police Department which informed the Chamber of Deputies of the irregularity of the applicant’s stay in Romania and the decision to repatriate her and the prohibition on her entering Romania for two years under Law no. 25/1969. 28. On 21 August 2000 the applicant sent a similar letter to the border police. 29. On 10 December 2001 the Romanian embassy in Rome, answering a letter sent by the applicant, congratulated her on her good command of the Romanian language, expressed regret for her distress, informed her that the prohibition had been lifted and advised her to contact the Italian embassy in Bucharest to assist her with the formalities in Romania. 30. The relevant provisions of Law no. 29/1990 on administrative litigation at the date of the facts are described in Sabin Popescu v. Romania, no. 48102/99, § 46, 2 March 2004. 31. Law 25/1969 on the status of foreigners provides as follows: “(1) A foreigner who resides temporarily in Romania has the obligation to leave the country when the residence permit expires. (2) The residence permit can be extended by the Ministry of Interior. A request for extension shall be made at least 24 hours before the expiry of the permit...” “The Minister of Interior may cancel or limit the right to reside in Romania to a foreigner who has breached Romanian law...” “(1) A foreigner temporarily residing in Romania whose right of residence has been cancelled shall leave the country within 48 hours of the time when the interdiction is communicated to him... (3) If he does not comply with the obligation above, he may be expelled by order of the Minister of Interior.” 32. The legislation has changed several times since 2001. Nowadays, under Emergency Ordinance no. 194/2002 as amended by Law no. 56/2007 and Emergency Ordinance no. 55/2007, a decision to expel a foreigner drafted in Romanian and in an international language is served on the person concerned, who may appeal against it before the court of appeal; the expulsion is suspended during the proceedings (see Hussain v. Romania, no. 12338/02, §§ 51-55, 14 February 2008).",['5'],"['5-1', '5-4']",['5-1-f'],['5'],['5-2'],[],1

De Gaetano,"5. The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Cardiff. 6. The applicant is a gypsy. In 1999 she moved to the Cae Garw caravan site in Port Talbot, Wales, with her two children. The site was owned by Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council. 7. On 12 June 2000 Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council entered into a licence agreement with the Gypsy Council which provided that the latter would manage the site. 8. On 29 March 2004 the applicant entered into a licence agreement with the Gypsy Council to occupy pitch 16 on the site. It was a condition of the licence that: “The Licensee or his/her resident family ... must not create a nuisance on the sites or to neighbouring properties. The Licensee shall be held responsible if any ... person living with ... her contravenes any of these Site Rules or Conditions.” 9. On 30 December 2004 the Gypsy Council issued a notice of termination of licence to the applicant which expired on 6 February 2005. The notice referred to a clause of her licence agreement which provided: “The Gypsy Council or the Licensee may terminate this licence by giving the other not less than 28 days written notice to expire on a Sunday in any week.” 10. No further reasons justifying the termination were given. 11. Notices to quit were also given to her parents, who occupied a different pitch on the site. 12. On 18 January 2005 amendments to section 4 of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 (“the 1968 Act”) entered into force which introduced the possibility for possession orders to be suspended by a court on the application of the occupier for up to twelve months at a time (see paragraph 36 below). 13. On 2 August 2005 the Gypsy Council issued a claim for possession against the applicant and five members of her extended family, including her parents, in Neath Port Talbot County Court. In its particulars of claim, the Gypsy Council alleged that all six defendants were guilty of causing very substantial nuisance to the site to the detriment of other occupiers. 14. The applicant’s parents did not apply for suspension or postponement of the orders. On 1 June 2006, possession orders were made against them by consent. 15. An oral hearing took place between 24 and 26 July 2006 in Swansea County Court and 28 July 2006 in Neath County Court in respect of the claim for possession against the applicant. In a witness statement lodged prior to the hearing, the applicant indicated that she intended to leave the site when her parents left. 16. On 25 July 2006 Judge Bidder QC gave a judgment on the preliminary issue of whether the applicant could challenge the making of a possession order in her case. He considered himself bound by the decision of the House of Lords in Kay and Price (see paragraph 42 below), which had examined the effect of this Court’s judgment in Connors v. the United Kingdom, no. 66746/01, 27 May 2004. Thus, he concluded, the only options open to the applicant were to challenge the domestic law itself or to commence judicial review proceedings based on conventional grounds. He concluded: “58. ... I do not consider it to be arguable that the decision of the claimants to seek possession against her was unreasonable or that their decision to invoke their domestic law rights could be castigated as unreasonable ... 59. Moreover, the fact that parliament has amended the applicable domestic legislation to afford the gypsy occupier the opportunity to contend that any possession order should be suspended for 12 months at a time distinguishes that case from Connors, and given that that amendment was considered in Kay and Price I find it impossible to say ... that there is a seriously arguable point raised that the law which enables the court to make the possession order is incompatible with article 8 ...” 17. He invited submissions from the applicant as to the possible temporary suspension of any possession order. He added: “71. I should say that on the issue of suspension of the ... order against the [applicant] of possession I would invite the parties to consider the date of 4th November 2006 being the date on which the [applicant’s] parents are required to leave and on which she indicates that she would leave anyway ...” 18. On 28 July 2006, following the applicant’s submissions that any possession order against her should be suspended, the judge handed down his judgment on the remaining issues. Having reviewed the allegations made against the applicant by the claimant, the judge concluded: “27. ... I am not satisfied that Maria Buckland has herself been guilty of any offensive behaviour on site, or of any breach of licence, apart from the relatively minor failure to pay the water charges.” 19. He was, however, satisfied that her son, who resided part of the time with her, had been involved in an incident on site in which he threatened someone with a gun, although it was not clear whether the gun had been real or merely an imitation; and had dumped garden refuse on the site. 20. Turning to consider whether the applicant’s personal circumstances, and those of her son, justified a suspension of the possession order which he would be making in her case the judge noted: “32. In relation to Maria Buckland, while I am obliged to make a possession order, I find her only breach of site conditions has been recent and is a very modest failure to pay water charges. She has indicated in a recent statement that she intends to move from the site when [her parents] leave, that is on or before 4pm on 24th November. I do consider it appropriate to suspend enforcement of the possession order against her until the same time and date. However, I am clear that the behaviour of [her son] on this site and his attitude towards the Farrows [the family of the site manager] is such that I have to impose conditions on her continued possession, as sought in the draft order – [her son] lives half his time with his father, and I have no doubt that if he cannot live with his mother, he will be able to live with his father ...” 21. He made an order for possession against the applicant, which he suspended until 24 November 2006 upon the condition that her son leave the site and that she discharge the GBP 95 arrears of water charges at the rate of GBP 5 per week. 22. On 18 April 2007 the applicant, who was still resident at the site, was granted permission to appeal the possession order to the Court of Appeal. A stay of execution of the order of 28 July 2006 was also ordered. 23. In November 2007 a bill which would amend the Mobile Homes Act 1983 (“the 1983 Act”) was introduced to Parliament. The effect of the proposed amendment was to allow a defendant in possession proceedings such as the applicant to challenge before the County Court the reasonableness of making a possession order. 24. On 12 December 2007 the applicant’s appeal was dismissed. Considering the impact of the amendment to the 1968 Act to allow suspension of a possession order on whether the applicant could succeed in a conventional public law challenge to the decision to seek a possession order, Lord Justice Dyson noted: “42. The significance of the amendment is that a claimant’s decision to seek possession does not involve summary eviction without judicial scrutiny of the justification of the claim to possession. By issuing proceedings, the claimant submits to the jurisdiction of the court,, including the claimant’s complaints about the defendant’s behaviour.” 25. He continued: “43. ... It may be that, for the reasons given by Lord Brown [in Kay], a public law defence could have been raised successfully in Connors. I would suggest that this is not so much because the family had been in occupation for a great length of time, but rather because it was unreasonable and grossly unfair for the local authority to seek a possession order and obtain the eviction of the occupier merely on the basis of a termination of the licence ‘without the need to make good any underlying reason for taking such precipitate action’. The real difference between the present case and Connors is not that the appellant had been in occupation for a shorter period than was the family in Connors ... On any view, the site was her home and had been for a substantial period of time. The fact that she had not been in occupation for as long as the family in Connors is not, in my judgment, of much significance. The real difference between the two cases is that in Connors, once the licence had been terminated, the authority was entitled to an order for possession whose enforcement could not be suspended by the court.” 26. He concluded that since the amendment to the 1968 Act, it was difficult to conceive of a case in which a public law defence would succeed. Referring also to the fact that Judge Bidder had made a finding of misconduct on the site by the applicant’s son, for whose behaviour she was responsible under the terms of the licence, Dyson LJ considered that the judge was right to hold that the public law defence was not seriously arguable. 27. Dyson LJ further noted that the factual situation of Connors was not materially different from the present case in that in both cases the defendant had occupied a site as a home for a number of years. Further, in both cases the claimant had validly and properly terminated the defendant’s licence to occupy so that the defendant had become a trespasser; the claimant was entitled to an order for possession as the owner of the land; and no further justification was required to seek an order for possession. However, it was agreed by the parties that it was not necessary to decide whether the present case could be distinguished from Connors as the distinction was only relevant for any appeal before the House of Lords. 28. Finally, in respect of the applicant’s argument that the amendment to section 4 of the 1968 Act did not remedy the incompatibility with Article 8, Dyson LJ emphasised that, in principle, a wide margin of appreciation was left to the national authorities in such matters. However, he accepted that the vulnerable position of gypsies as a minority meant that “some special consideration should be given to their needs and different lifestyle both in the relevant regulatory framework and in reaching decisions in particular cases” (citing Connors, § 83). He found that the main reason for the narrowing of the margin of appreciation in Connors itself was that the complete absence of any procedural safeguards was a serious interference with the applicant’s Article 8 rights in that case, which called for particularly weighty reasons of public interest in justification. However, the precise scope of these safeguards was in his view, a matter for the national authorities to determine. He considered that provided that a reasonable degree of protection was afforded by the domestic law, the Strasbourg Court would not interfere, even if a greater degree of protection could have been afforded. He accordingly rejected the applicant’s submissions, noting: “60. The objectionable feature of the legal regime in place before the amendment was that the court was bound not merely to make an order for possession, but to order the eviction of an occupant such as the appellant provided that the 4 weeks’ notice was given. Absent a public law challenge, the occupant had no opportunity to challenge the reasons given by the local authority for seeking possession and the court had no jurisdiction to take the reasons into account in deciding whether to order the occupant’s eviction. The local authority’s reasons were irrelevant as were the occupant’s personal circumstances. Nor did the court have power to suspend an order for possession even in circumstances of extreme hardship which indicated that eviction would not be justified under article 8(2). In short, there was no opportunity for the court to make any assessment of the justification for eviction in order to determine whether the interference with an occupier’s rights under article 8(1) was justified on an application of article 8(2). Provided that the relevant formal requirements had been satisfied, the role of the court was purely mechanistic. 61. The amendment has introduced procedural protections which ensure that the role of the court is no longer a mechanistic one even when a local authority seeks to evict a licensee from a caravan site. Summary eviction has been replaced by judicial examination. Section 4(1) now provides that the enforcement of a possession order may be suspended for such period up to 12 months ‘as the court thinks reasonable’. The court has a wide discretion under subsection (2) to impose conditions when making an order for suspension. By subsection (3), the court may extend the suspension of the possession order for up to 12 months at a time. Subsection (4) requires the court to have regard to ‘all the circumstances’ in deciding whether to exercise its power to suspend. The court is, therefore, ...” 29. He concluded: “63. In my judgment, the decision to provide the procedural safeguards introduced by the amendment of section 4 of the 1968 Act was within the margin of appreciation available to the United Kingdom. More generous safeguards could have been introduced (and they will be when the 1983 Act is amended). But the amendment goes far enough to meet the real thrust of the criticisms made in Connors.” 30. As to the applicant’s argument that the legislation discriminated against gypsies, Dyson LJ found that although the discrimination point was one of the features of the Court’s reasoning in Connors, it was not the main reason for the decision. Even if that was wrong, Dyson LJ considered that by addressing the lack of procedural safeguards for gypsies of local authority sites, the amendment had also gone a long way to meeting the discrimination point. While discrimination would not be cured completely until the 1983 Act was amended, it had been much mitigated. Thus to the extent that the discrimination persisted, the decision not to eliminate it altogether fell within the margin of appreciation accorded to the contracting States. 31. On 18 February 2008 the House of Lords refused the applicant’s request for permission to appeal. 32. In May 2008 the applicant left Cae Garw caravan site for alternative accommodation on land owned by her brother. She claims that her departure was the result of the refusal of leave to appeal and in the face of further threats of eviction The land owned by her brother has no planning permission for residential use and its occupants, which include the applicant’s brother, his six children and the applicants’ parents, share minimal facilities, namely one toilet and one sink with cold running water in a shed with no lighting. 33. Part I of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 (“the 1968 Act”) provides limited security of tenure to certain occupiers of caravans and caravan sites. Section 2 provides that at least four weeks’ notice of termination of a licence to occupy a caravan site must be given. 34. Section 4(1) provides that when a court makes an order for the removal or exclusion of an occupier from a caravan site, it may suspend the enforcement of that order for up to twelve months at a time. 35. Section 4(4) provides that in considering whether or how to exercise its powers under this section, the court shall have regard to all the circumstances, and in particular to the questions: “(a) whether the occupier of the caravan has failed, whether before or after the expiration or determination of the relevant residential contract, to observe any terms or conditions of that contract, any conditions of the site licence, or any reasonable rules made by the owner for the management and conduct of the site or the maintenance of caravans thereon; (b) whether the occupier has unreasonably refused an offer by the owner to renew the residential contract or make another such contract for a reasonable period and on reasonable terms; (c) whether the occupier has failed to make reasonable efforts to obtain elsewhere other suitable accommodation for his caravan (or, as the case may be, another suitable caravan and accommodation for it).” 36. Section 4(6) of the 1968 Act formerly excluded the court’s power to suspend the enforcement of a possession order under section 4(1) in the case of possession proceedings brought by local authorities. However, the exclusion of local authority caravan sites from the ambit of the power to suspend under section 4(1) was removed by the Housing Act 2004, which entered into force on 18 January 2005, in respect of proceedings begun on or after that date. 37. The Mobile Homes Act 1983 (“the 1983 Act”) was enacted, inter alia, to restrict the eviction from caravan sites of occupiers of caravans. It applies to any agreement under which a person is entitled to station a mobile home on land forming part of a “protected site” and to occupy it as his only or main residence and implies into licence agreements falling within the ambit of its provisions various protective terms. 38. Section 2(1) and paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 to the 1983 Act provide that the owner of a relevant site is entitled to terminate the licence only if (i) he satisfies the court that the occupier has breached a term of the licence agreement and has failed to comply with a notice to remedy the breach; and (ii) the court considers it reasonable for the agreement to be terminated. 39. Section 5(1) defines “protected site” by reference to its definition in the 1968 Act (essentially applying to land authorised for long-term residence). However, the section expressly excludes from the definition any land occupied by a local authority as a caravan site providing accommodation for gypsies. 40. Pursuant to section 321 and Schedule 16 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008, which was enacted on 22 July 2008, the exclusion of land used for accommodating gypsies from the definition of “protected site” in section 5(1) of the 1983 Act is removed. The amendment has entered into force in England but has not yet entered into force in Wales. 41. For a general summary of domestic proceedings prior to November 2010 regarding the right of defendants to rely on Article 8 in the context of a defence to possession proceedings, see the Court’s judgment in Kay and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 37341/06, §§ 18-43, 21 September 2010. 42. Notably, in Kay and others v. London Borough of Lambeth and others; and Leeds City Council v. Price and others [2006] UKHL 10, Lord Hope of Craighead clarified that a challenge to possession proceedings could only be based either on an argument that the law itself was incompatible with Article 8; or on conventional judicial review grounds. 43. The subsequent case of Doherty and others v. Birmingham City Council [2008] UKHL 57, decided after the applicant’s appeal was dismissed, concerned the eviction of gypsies from a local authority caravan site. Lord Hope concluded that it was open to the defendant to argue that the law itself was incompatible with the Convention because the relevant legal framework was indistinguishable from that which applied in Connors. He considered that in light of the clear terms of the legislation allowing the local authority possession, there was no scope for interpreting it in a manner which was Convention-compatible and continued: “50. ... This raises the question whether your Lordships should make a declaration of incompatibility ... The incompatibility with the appellant’s article 8 rights that was to be found in section 4(6)(a) of the 1968 Act has been removed by section 211(1) of the Housing Act 2004. As already noted, a clause was included in the Housing and Regeneration Bill to remove the exclusion of local authority sites which provide accommodation for gipsies from the protection of the 1983 Act. Nevertheless, prior to its receiving the Royal Assent ..., Lord Walker favoured the making of a declaration of incompatibility in relation to section 5(1) of the 1983 Act. 51. I was at first inclined to doubt whether a declaration was necessary. The power to make a declaration ... is, after all, a discretionary one. But on reflection I agreed that it would be appropriate to make such a declaration in this case. Indeed I considered that the decision of the Strasbourg court in Connors left the House with no alternative but to do this. That was a judgment which was pronounced in a case against the United Kingdom. Its decision is as plain an indication as there could be that there was an incompatibility in our legislation that ought to be addressed by the United Kingdom Parliament ... In such circumstances the decision as to whether the incompatibility should remain was not for the court to take. It had to be left to the government and to Parliament, and it could not be taken for granted that the amending legislation would be passed. In the events that have happened, however, the making of a declaration has become unnecessary ...” 44. On 3 November 2010 the Supreme Court handed down its judgment in Manchester City Council v. Pinnock [2010] UKSC 45 (“Pinnock”), sitting as a panel of nine judges. The case concerned possession proceedings brought against a demoted tenant. Following a review of the case-law, the Supreme Court considered the following propositions to be well-established in the jurisprudence of this Court: “(a) Any person at risk of being dispossessed of his home at the suit of a local authority should in principle have the right to raise the question of the proportionality of the measure, and to have it determined by an independent tribunal in the light of article 8, even if his right of occupation under domestic law has come to an end ... (b) A judicial procedure which is limited to addressing the proportionality of the measure through the medium of traditional judicial review (i e, one which does not permit the court to make its own assessment of the facts in an appropriate case) is inadequate as it is not appropriate for resolving sensitive factual issues ... (c) Where the measure includes proceedings involving more than one stage, it is the proceedings as a whole which must be considered in order to see if article 8 has been complied with ... (d) If the court concludes that it would be disproportionate to evict a person from his home notwithstanding the fact that he has no domestic right to remain there, it would be unlawful to evict him so long as the conclusion obtains – for example, for a specified period, or until a specified event occurs, or a particular condition is satisfied.” 45. The Supreme Court considered that in order for domestic law to be compatible with Article 8 of the Convention, where a court was asked by a local authority to make an order for possession of a person’s home, the court had to have the power to assess the proportionality of making the order, and, in making that assessment, to resolve any relevant dispute of fact. In terms of the practical implications of this principle, the Supreme Court noted that if domestic law justified an outright order for possession, the effect of Article 8 could, albeit in exceptional cases, justify granting an extended period for possession, suspending the order for possession on the happening of an event, or even refusing an order altogether. Finally, the court observed that the need for a court to have the ability to assess the Article 8 proportionality of making a possession order in respect of a person’s home might require certain statutory and procedural provisions to be revisited. 46. On 23 February 2001 the Supreme Court handed down its judgment in the joined cases of Mayor and Burgesses of the London Borough of Hounslow v. Powell; Leeds City Council v. Hall; Birmingham City Council v. Frisby [2011] UKSC 8 (“Powell and others”). In its judgment, the court extended its approach in Pinnock to introductory tenancies and tenancies under the homelessness regime.",['8'],['8-1'],[],[],[],[],1

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE 5. The applicants were born in 1990 and 1989 respectively and live in Chişinău. 6. The present case concerns the circumstances surrounding the killing of the applicants’ 29-year-old brother Alexei Vlasi during a police operation on 14 March 2009. 7. On that date at approximately 10.20 p.m. three plain-clothed police officers (N., B. and C.) entered a five-storey apartment block to arrest a person suspected of armed robbery. According to their information, the suspect in question was supposed to be visiting his ex-girlfriend M. that evening, who lived on the fourth floor of the building. 8. At the same time, M. was coming down the stairs from the fourth floor with a group of four friends. None of them was the suspect wanted by the police. Two young women (S. and Z.) and a young man (G.) were at the front of the group and they passed the police officers between the third and second floor. 9. Upon passing the first part of the group one of the police officers immediately apprehended G. Alexei Vlasi and M. were several storeys up and saw the police officers as they approached the rest of the group. Two police officers rushed after Alexei Vlasi, who started to run back up the stairs. They apprehended him on the fifth floor. Shortly afterwards, one of the police officers shot him in the back of the head at very close range. He died instantly. 10. An investigation followed, during which all the witnesses and police officers were questioned. There were two versions of events: that of the group of friends coming down the stairs with the victim (the witnesses), and that of the police officers. 11. The witnesses’ version was that two police officers, N. and C., were armed with pistols which they were holding upwards. Upon passing the first part of the group, the officers saw that there was someone else upstairs and ran in that direction, leaving the first part of the group with police officer N. They then told police officer N. to come upstairs with the rest of the group. After apprehending Alexei Vlasi somewhere on the fifth floor, police officers B. and C. started to beat him up. All the members of the group recounted an almost identical description of what they had heard and the conversation that had taken place between the two police officers and Alexei Vlasi. According to them, one of the police officers (B.) called Alexei Vlasi by his first name and told him to follow them. In response, he addressed B. by his first name and told him to stop beating him up. Sounds of someone being beaten up were heard and Alexei Vlasi threatened to report his injuries to a forensic doctor. The manner in which he said this last sentence was very specific, as he used a mixture of both Romanian and Russian words and the witnesses recounted it in the same manner. It later transpired that police officer B. and Alexei Vlasi already knew each other, as in 1999 the latter had been arrested by the former for bicycle theft. 12. The encounter between police officers B. and C. and Alexei Vlasi took place on the fifth and top floor. Two of the witnesses M. and G. were the closest to the scene at the time, being held by police officer N. on the fourth floor. The fourth floor was separated from the fifth floor by two flights of stairs going in opposite directions joined by an intermediate landing. M. (who also already knew police officer B.) started to shout at him, telling him to leave Alexei Vlasi alone. She called him by his first name and tried to get past police officer N. in order to help Alexei Vlasi. In her struggle with police officer N. she could partly see what was happening on the fifth floor. G. was also there. According to them, police officer B. grabbed Alexei Vlasi by his right hand while officer C. grabbed him by his left hand and started to make his way down the stairs from the fifth floor to the landing between the fifth and fourth floors. At about the third from last step, Alexei Vlasi was facing the handrail and grabbed it. The police officers who were behind him bent him over and, according to one of the witnesses, held both his hands behind his back. According to another witness, one of his hands was on the handrail while the other was held by a police officer behind his back. Police officer C. was holding his pistol at the back of Alexei Vlasi’s head while he was bent over. Police officer B. punched him in the ribs and he repeated again that he would be reporting his injuries to a forensic doctor. Immediately afterwards, he was shot in the back of the head by police officer C. at very close range. He collapsed on the landing between the two flights of stairs, with his feet on the stairs and his body on the landing. Blood started to spurt out of his head wound. M. shouted: “He shot him straight in the head!” and her first reaction was to try to stop him losing any more blood with her hands. In what appeared to be an attack of hysteria she started to scream and to attack police officer B. and shouted “Why did you do that?” Another female friend in the group approached her from behind, hugged her and tried to pull her away from the body. 13. According to the witnesses, Alexei Vlasi did not have anything in his hands after collapsing to the ground. Police officer B. asked officer C.: “What the hell did you do?!” C. did not respond with anything intelligible but remained still, holding his head in his hands. One of the witnesses said they heard him respond in a low voice: “I didn’t want to do that”. He was very pale. According to the witnesses he did not have any visible injuries and could walk perfectly well. Immediately afterwards, officer B. ordered all the witnesses to go into M.’s apartment on the fourth floor. He and police officer N. pushed everybody into her apartment and closed the door. Police officer N. was holding the doorknob so that nobody could leave. Many of the neighbours started to look out of their apartments but the police officers ordered them all to close their doors and stay inside. 14. According to the police officers, when Alexei Vlasi ran up the stairs, they thought he was the suspect they had been after. They claimed to have been convinced that the victim was the suspect they were looking for and that they only realised their mistake after he had been shot. However, during a confrontation which took place later, police officer B. admitted he had known Alexei Vlasi for a long time. The following description of the police officers’ version of events was made after a video reconstruction of the scene, which was filmed during the investigation with the participation of police officer C. on 7 August 2009. Police officer B. recounted an identical version of events. 15. Police officer B. chased Alexei Vlasi and approached him from behind on the landing of the top, fifth floor. He put his hand on his shoulder, called him by the name of the wanted suspect, announced that he was a police officer and asked him to come with him. At that moment Alexei turned around and punched police officer B. in the face with his right fist and attempted to run down the stairs. When he punched police officer B. he did not have anything in his hand. Police officer B. was pushed into a wall on his right and lost his balance. However, police officer C., who had already approached them from behind, managed to apprehend Alexei Vlasi by pulling his left arm near his shoulder (in his initial statement police officer C. stated that he had apprehended him by the collar of his jacket). The apprehension took place on the top three steps of the flight of stairs leading to the fifth floor. Police officer C. was behind Alexei Vlasi on a higher step, holding his hand with his left hand and holding his pistol pointed upwards in his right hand. At that moment, without changing his position, Alexei Vlasi stabbed police officer C. in the right thigh with a knife, which he had been holding in his right hand in reverse grip. Then, without changing the position of the knife, Alexei Vlasi attempted to turn to his left and to stab police officer C. in the face. According to police officer C., Alexei Vlasi had been standing upright. Fearing for his life, police officer C. pulled the trigger of the pistol he was still holding upwards and shot him in the upper neck. The police officers did not say how the victim’s body ended up on the landing between the fifth and fourth floor some six or seven steps lower, but it is reasonable to infer that it rolled down by itself before slumping at the bottom of the stairs. 16. A criminal investigation was formally initiated on 15 March 2009. According to a report describing the scene, Alexei Vlasi’s body was lying in a pool of blood on the intermediate landing between the fourth and fifth floors. There was an open small pocket knife with a lock mechanism with a blade 6.5 cm long in the palm of his right hand. His feet were on the first two steps of the flight of stairs leading to the fifth floor. There were traces of blood on those steps. The report contains pictures of areas stained with blood, such as the landing where the body was lying, the walls around it, and the landing between the third and the fourth floor, where blood had run down from above. No traces of blood appear to have been found above the steps on which the victim’s feet were located. On the wall above the sixth step of the flight of stairs going down to the fourth floor from the landing where the body was lying, there was a bullet hole 2.3 metres above the step, exactly opposite where the witnesses alleged the victim had been shot when facing the handrail. 17. During the investigation, the Chişinău prosecutor’s office obtained several forensic reports which found, inter alia, that the entry wound was on Alexei Vlasi’s upper left neck and the exit wound was on the right side of his forehead above his eyebrow. According to the forensic report, the shot was fired at such close range that gunshot residue was present on the victim’s skin around the entry wound. Another forensic report found that the police officer who had shot him had had an injury to his right thigh made by a knife wound and the other police officer who had allegedly been punched in the face by Alexei had had a bruise on his face. Another expert report did not find any fingerprints on the knife found in Alexei Vlasi’s palm after his death. 18. On 21 September 2009 the Chişinău prosecutor’s office decided to discontinue the criminal investigation on the grounds that the police officer who shot Alexei Vlasi had acted in self-defence. The prosecutor’s office was based on the police officers’ version of events. The applicants challenged the above decision before the Prosecutor General’s Office. 19. On 9 October 2009 a deputy Prosecutor General quashed the above decision on the grounds that it was based exclusively on the police officers’ version of events and that no consideration was given to the witnesses’ statements. The investigator had failed to determine the exact place of the shooting and the victim’s position in relation to the shooter. Moreover, no ballistics test had been conducted in order to determine the trajectory of the bullet. 20. In the reopened investigation some of the witnesses were re-questioned. One of them, G., changed his statements and submitted that he had not seen or heard anything, but later claimed that he had only done so because he had been pressured and threatened to do so by the accused police officers. 21. A ballistics test was carried out with the help of an assistant standing where the police officers alleged the victim had been standing at the time of shooting. The assistant had a cabbage placed on his shoulder, near his head. Through a hole pierced in the cabbage, a thread was led to the bullet hole in the wall, which was considerably lower than the cabbage. Taking into consideration the positions of the entry and exit wounds on the victim’s head, it was concluded that, at the moment of the shooting, the victim had been bent over and not standing upright as suggested by the police officers in their version of events. 22. On 30 June 2010 the Chişinău prosecutor’s office again discontinued the criminal proceedings on similar grounds as the first time, namely on the basis of the police officers’ version of events. It does not appear that the prosecutor attempted to reconcile the findings of the ballistics test with the police officers’ version of events concerning the circumstances of Alexei Vlasi’s shooting. The applicants appealed. 23. On 22 July 2010 a hierarchically superior prosecutor dismissed the applicants’ appeal. They appealed to an investigating judge. 24. On 20 October 2010 an investigating judge from the Rascani District Court upheld the applicants’ appeal, quashed the decisions of 30 June and 22 July 2010 and ordered a re-investigation of the case. He concluded that the investigation had been incomplete and that the conclusions reached by the investigators were inconsistent with the evidence in the case file. The investigating judge also noted that no confrontations had been carried out between all the witnesses and the accused officers, no importance had been attached to the fact that no fingerprints had been found on the knife the victim had allegedly stabbed police officer C. with, and that the investigation had not been conducted within a reasonable time. 25. Following the investigating judge’s decision, the applicants applied to the Prosecutor General’s Office with a request to have the case removed from the Chişinău prosecutor’s office on account of its bias and to have it transferred to another prosecutor’s office. On 8 November 2010 a deputy Prosecutor General rejected the applicants’ request as ill-founded. 26. On 27 April 2011 the Chişinău prosecutor’s office questioned witness M. again. On 17 May 2011 witness G. was questioned again. He submitted having seen police officer B. stabbing police officer C. in his thigh with a knife before being forced into M.’s apartment after the shooting. According to him, this took place between the third and the fourth floor and he had mentioned it during his initial questioning, but no record had been made. Confrontations were organised between M. and police officer B. and between G. and police officer B. on 20 and 24 May 2011, during which each party maintained their statements. 27. On 21 July 2011 witness G. took a lie-detector test to determine whether his statement about police officer B. stabbing police office C. with a knife was truthful. The test result was negative, i.e. G.’s statement was not truthful. 28. On 15 September 2011 the Chişinău prosecutor’s office again discontinued the criminal investigation on similar grounds as the previous occasions. The results of the lie-detector test were added to the decision. The applicants appealed against it and argued that the results of the liedetector test were inadmissible because the test had been carried out by colleagues of the accused police officers rather than by independent experts. 29. On 20 October 2011 the hierarchically superior prosecutor dismissed the applicants’ appeal. They appealed to an investigating judge. 30. On 12 December 2011 an investigating judge from the Rascani District Court upheld the applicants’ appeal, again finding that the investigation had been incomplete. The judge also declared the results of the lie-detector test inadmissible. 31. On 13 April 2012, without conducting any further investigative measures, a prosecutor from the Chişinău prosecutor’s office again discontinued the criminal investigation. The content of the decision was identical to that of the decision of 15 September 2011, including reference to the lie-detector test. 32. On 9 July 2012 the hierarchically superior prosecutor dismissed the applicants’ appeal. They appealed to an investigating judge. 33.

LITHUANIA,3,Violation of Article 2 - Right to life (Article 2 - Positive obligations;Article 2-1 - Life;Effective investigation);Pecuniary damage - award;Non-pecuniary damage - award,András Sajó;Guido Raimondi;Helen Keller;Nebojša Vučinić;Peer Lorenzen,"5. The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in Vilnius. 6. On 6 June 2005 the applicant’s son, E.B., born on 20 August 1991 and then thirteen years of age, was playing with other children outside the applicant’s apartment, situated in Naujamiestis district (Naujamiesčio seniūnija) in the city of Vilnius. Whilst the children were standing on the balcony of an ancillary building containing cellars, the balcony broke off the building and collapsed. Part of the balcony fell on E.B., who died at the scene from the injuries he received. Two other children, V.J. and A.B., suffered minor bodily injuries. 7. On the same day the police opened a pre-trial investigation. On that day and the next investigators surveyed the scene of the accident. 8. On 7 June 2005 a forensic expert established that E.B. had died because the balcony block had fallen on to him, broken his spine and crushed his internal organs. 9. By Vilnius city police investigator’s decision of 4 July 2005 the applicant was recognised as having victim status. 10. According to the Government, after the accident the future of the ancillary building containing the cellars was discussed at a meeting of the Vilnius municipal council on 14 June 2005. An expert inspection of 18 July 2005 recommended that the building be fenced off until it could be demolished. [The Vilnius city municipality] Commission on Residential and Non-Residential Houses and Premises on 11 October 2005 approved the demolition of the building. In accordance with a contract signed on 4 October 2005 between the Vilnius city council and Naujamiesčio būstas, the Vilnius municipal enterprise, in December 2005 that enterprise demolished the building. 11. On 7 September 2006 the applicant lodged, in the criminal proceedings, a civil claim for non-pecuniary damage, in the sum of 3,000,000 Lithuanian litai (LTL), and for litigation costs with the Vilnius City Prosecutor’s Office. She submitted that the Vilnius city municipality and its institutions had failed to supervise the buildings and, as a result, her son had died. The loss caused her immense moral suffering and depression. Even though it was not possible to bring her son back, the persons responsible should compensate the non-pecuniary damage. The applicant also referred to Article 6.250 § 2 of the Civil Code (see Relevant domestic law below), arguing that the amount of damage could be assessed according to all the circumstances established in the criminal case and the [criminal] court had such competence. 12. By a decision of 21 November 2006, the prosecutor recognised the applicant as a civil claimant in the criminal case, on the basis of Articles 109 and 110 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 13. On 11 January 2007 A.J., an employee of Naujamiesčio būstas, was charged with the offence of failure to fulfil official duties, under Article 229 of the Criminal Code. The authorities considered that A.J. had failed to inspect the buildings at issue and to inform the municipality of their condition, even though he had been assigned that function by order of the Naujamiesčio būstas director on 28 January 2004. On the same day the authorities imposed a restrictive measure on A.J., namely an obligation not to leave his place of residence. 14. By a decision of 11 October 2007 the Vilnius City Prosecutor’s Office discontinued the pre-trial investigation. The prosecutor referred to Article 7 § 13 of the Law on Local Self-Governance which determined that in the most general sense supervision of the use of construction works was the municipality’s responsibility. Similarly, Article 42 of the Law on Construction set out the municipality’s duty to supervise the use of residential houses and other constructions. The prosecutor analysed in detail whose responsibility it had been, and when, in respect of Vilnius city municipality and Naujamiesčio būstas, to supervise the buildings, given that there had been changes in the bodies between 1999 and 2005. She noted that in May 2004 the city had made some enquiries of Naujamiesčio būstas about the cellars, but there was no-one in the municipality who had the responsibility of supervising the activities of Naujamiesčio būstas. However, the prosecutor considered that the evidence gathered was contradictory, and that therefore it was not possible to establish which body – the Vilnius city municipality or Naujamiesčio būstas – had been responsible for the proper maintenance of the building, the collapse of which had resulted in the death of the applicant’s son. Therefore the prosecutor could not identify any physical person who could be held accountable for failure to act and to ensure that the building was in good condition and not dangerous. The prosecutor thus dropped the criminal charges in respect of A.J. Moreover, under Article 229 of the Criminal Code a corporate person could not be held criminally liable. However, the prosecutor noted that, in accordance with Article 6.266 of the Civil Code, the applicant and the parents of the two injured children could lodge civil proceedings against Vilnius city municipality or Naujamiesčio būstas, and claim that the building had been left unattended. 15. The applicant appealed against the above decision, arguing that the Vilnius city municipality and Naujamiesčio būstas had been aware for a long time that the building was in a dangerous state (avarinės būklės), but no one had known what to do with it. The father of V.J. also appealed, submitting that the investigation had been going on for a long time, but no person had been found responsible for the building and thus for the accident. 16. By a decision of 12 November 2007 a prosecutor reopened the investigation. She noted that it was imperative to take measures to identify the person or persons whose responsibility it had been to take care of the building’s maintenance and to establish why they had not done so. 17. On 3 July 2008 another prosecutor at the Vilnius City Prosecutor’s Office decided to discontinue the pre-trial investigation. The prosecutor found that the evidence as regards which body owned the collapsed building was contradictory. However, he considered that the Vilnius city municipality was the de facto owner of the building. On the basis of documents dated 2004 and 2005, the prosecutor also concluded that the municipality had known earlier about the poor condition of the building where the accident had happened. Nonetheless, in 2004-05 an administrative reform had taken place within the Vilnius city municipality, as a result of which new administrative units had been created, the responsibilities of those units redistributed and new people assigned to those administrative units. Consequently, at the time of the incident there was no one who had the duty to manage derelict and unused buildings. There was therefore insufficient evidence to find that a crime under Article 229 of the Criminal Code had been committed. 18. The prosecutor also suggested that the applicant lodge a civil claim on the basis of Article 6.266 of the Civil Code. 19. On 12 August 2008 a higher prosecutor upheld that decision. The applicant appealed. 20. On 12 January 2009 the Vilnius City First District Court found that the pre-trial investigation had not been sufficiently thorough and effective. As a result, the identity of the owner of the derelict buildings had not been established. The court drew the prosecutor’s attention to specific actions to be taken and specific circumstances to be examined, whilst noting the applicant’s earlier requests to the prosecutor to the same effect. Having given the prosecutor precise instructions, including to obtain archived documents from 1970-75, the district court emphasised that without that specific information it was not possible to establish the identity of persons who had failed to adopt a timely final decision, in accordance with their official duties, about the future of the derelict buildings and their proper maintenance. The prosecutor’s decision was quashed as unfounded. 21. On 2 March and 22 July 2009 the applicant wrote to the Attorney General, arguing that the pre-trial investigation had been superficial and that the prosecutors at the Vilnius City Prosecutor’s Office had been passive and unwilling to discover the truth, thus stalling the investigation. For the applicant, the investigation in essence consisted of sending written questions and answers from one municipal institution to another. It was clear that neither of the institutions, Vilnius city municipality or Naujamiesčio būstas, was willing to take responsibility for failing to perform its duties. The applicant thus asked the Attorney General to take over the investigation or to transfer it to the Vilnius Regional Prosecutor’s Office. She also observed that although more than seven months had passed since the court decision of 12 January 2009, the prosecutors had still not taken all the required investigative actions. 22. On 30 July 2009, the Vilnius City District Prosecutor’s Office again discontinued the pre-trial investigation, in essence upholding the conclusions of the decision of 3 July 2008 to the effect that the evidence as to which body was in possession of the building at issue was contradictory. Accordingly, it was not possible to identify the physical person whose duty it was to maintain the building, and who was therefore liable for the death of one child and injury of two others. 23. On 29 September 2009 the applicant appealed, arguing that even though four years had passed since the accident, the prosecutors had not been active enough and had therefore failed to establish who was responsible for the maintenance of the building. The applicant argued in addition that the prosecutors had also failed to take all the steps which had been ordered by the court on 12 January 2009. The correspondence between Vilnius city municipality and Naujamiesčio būstas showed that both bodies had known the building was derelict, and yet no effort had been made to repair or demolish it. Immediately after the incident the building had been fenced off and demolished by the municipality, even though the municipality had earlier denied that it was within its control and had argued that it did not have the legal authority to tear down the building. The applicant asked for the pre-trial investigation to be reopened. 24. By a higher prosecutor’s decision of 16 October 2009, the investigation was reopened. For the prosecutor, it was possible that the employees of the Vilnius city municipality or those of Naujamiesčio būstas had not performed their duties that stemmed from [Article 229 of] the Criminal Code, Article 42 § 1 (3) of the Law on Construction and other relevant legal acts. It was therefore indispensable to establish which particular person had been designated by the municipality to inspect/supervise the buildings without owners in question (kam pavesta bešeimininkių pastatų priežiūra) in Naujamiestis district. If such functions had not been assigned to any particular unit or person at the municipal or district level, the prosecutor should consider whether the municipality’s or district’s managers (vadovai) should be held responsible under Article 229 of the Criminal Code. 25. On 7 December 2009 K.G., a senior specialist in Naujamiestis district, was charged with failure to carry out official duties, under Article 229 of the Criminal Code. By a decision of the Naujamiestis district director (seniūno) on 3 January 2005 K.G. had been given the responsibility of monitoring empty buildings belonging to the municipality. The criminal investigator considered that K.G. had failed to inform the municipality about the danger posed by the derelict cellars in question, as he should have done under Article 42 [§ 3 (1)] of the Law on Construction (see paragraph 33 below). 26. On 18 May 2010 a prosecutor for the Vilnius City District discontinued the investigation, as no physical persons criminally liable for the accident could be identified. The prosecutor noted, however, that the Vilnius city municipality had learned on 28 February 2005 of the poor state of the building the collapse of which had caused the death of the applicant’s son. However, at that time the municipality was going through structural changes and the duties and responsibilities of the municipality’s employees were being redistributed, therefore there was no particular person with the specific duty to take action on derelict and abandoned buildings. Moreover, taking into account the short period of time that had elapsed between that date and the accident (three months), it was not possible to conclude that the municipality’s employees had been stalling the process of finding a solution to the question of what had to be done with the building. The evidence collected in the case did not prove that employees of the Vilnius city municipality, the Naujamiestis district or Naujamiesčio būstas had failed to carry out any of their clearly prescribed duties and had thus caused the death of one child and injuries to two others. The prosecutor therefore dismissed the criminal charges against A.J., an employee of Naujamiesčio būstas, and against K.G., a Naujamiestis district specialist. The prosecutor suggested that the applicant and the parents of the two children who had been injured in the accident bring separate civil proceedings under Article 6.266 of the Civil Code. 27. The applicant appealed, arguing that the case should be returned for a fresh pre-trial examination, so that the ownership of the buildings could be established and the persons (physical and corporate) liable for the accident thus identified. 28. By a ruling of 9 August 2010 the Vilnius City First District Court refused to reopen the pre-trial investigation, because a criminal action under Article 229 of the Criminal Code had become time-barred. The pre-trial investigation had been opened on 7 June 2005 and the Code of Criminal Procedure provided a five-year term to prosecute a crime of a negligent or minor premeditated nature. The court therefore did not address the applicant’s complaint that the pre-trial investigation had been flawed. 29. The applicant appealed, questioning the effectiveness of the investigation and asking for it to be reopened. 30. By a final ruling of 15 September 2010 the Vilnius Regional Court upheld the lower court’s decision to discontinue criminal proceedings under the statute of limitations. 31. According to Article 19 of the Lithuanian Constitution, a person’s right to life shall be protected by law. 32. The Law on Local Self-Government provides that one of the functions of a municipality is to supervise how buildings are used and to manage land and other property which belong to it by the right of ownership (Article 7 §§ 13 and 15). 33. The Law on Construction at the relevant time provided: “1. The following public administration bodies shall exercise supervision of use of construction works: 1) the regional governor’s office as in the list approved by the Government, or an institution authorised by it, in respect of constructions of exceptional significance, those of national significance, and construction works situated within establishments of likely hazard, with the exception of the construction works referred to in subparagraph 2 of paragraph 1 of this Article; 2) the Ministry of Communication and Transport and/or organisations authorised by it as in the list approved by the Government or an institution authorised by it, in respect of traffic routes and other engineering constructions related thereto, as well as hydrotechnical construction works in the Baltic Sea and bodies of inland water, with the exception of traffic routes which do not belong to the sphere of its management; 3) municipal authorities, in respect of residential dwellings and other constructions which are not specified in sub-paragraphs 1 and 2 of paragraph 1 of this Article ... 3. Public authorities which are engaged in supervision of the use of buildings shall enjoy the following rights: 1) in the event that it becomes clear that the condition of a building poses a threat to the health or life of people who reside, work or happen to be for other purposes in the building or near it, or to the environment, and taking into account the type of threat posed, they may demand that the operator of the building take measures to protect people and, if necessary, may insist that the area be evacuated, that the building cease to be used, or they may prohibit any activity in the building (if necessary also within the construction site or area); 2) they may set time-limits for taking all the actions specified in sub-paragraph 1 and immediately inform the owner of the building (when the user is not the owner of the building or works); 3) they may contact the police in order to temporarily restrict access to the area or premises, to stop works which are being carried out there, and to restrict or prohibit traffic, if the environment, public order, personal safety or the State are endangered; 4) in cases and procedures laid down by the Code of Administrative Law Offences, they may draw up a record of administrative offences, consider administrative offences and impose administrative penalties, or refer administrative offences to the courts. 4. Officers of public administration bodies which are engaged in supervision of the use of buildings shall have the right to demand that the operator of a construction site produce mandatory documents relating to the supervision of the site, as referred to in Article 43 of this Law, indicating that they have permission to perform such other functions in connection with supervision of the use of buildings, which have been assigned to them...” 34. On 4 February 1999 the Vilnius city management board adopted decision 205V “Approval of order giving power to declare buildings in poor condition, and identification of buildings in Vilnius which may be taken into the possession of the local authority”. Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the order set out the district director’s (seniūno) duty to manage lists and keep records of derelict buildings, and to periodically provide those documents to the Vilnius city management board. Companies which have contracts to manage buildings, district engineers and senior local architects were responsible for the provision of data for the above-mentioned lists. 35. On 24 February 1999 the Vilnius city mayor adopted decision 100 “Derelict Buildings Commission”. The commission was to meet once a week, to analyse information provided by district directors and to deal with issues concerning demolition of buildings in poor condition. 36. The Criminal Code provides: “A civil servant or a person equivalent thereto who fails to perform his duties through negligence or performs them inappropriately, where this results in significant damage to the State or to a legal or a natural person, shall be punished by deprivation of the right to be employed in certain positions or to engage in certain types of activity or by a fine or by arrest or by imprisonment for a term of up to two years.” 37. Pursuant to Article 95 of the Criminal Code and Article 3 § 1 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as relevant at the material time, a person who has committed a criminal offence may not be convicted once five years have lapsed, if for example an offence such as failure to perform official duties has been committed. 38. Articles 109 and 110 of the Code of Criminal Procedure stipulate that a person who has sustained pecuniary or non-pecuniary damage because of a crime may lodge a civil claim against the suspect within criminal proceedings. The claim will be examined by the criminal court together with the criminal case. A civil claimant may submit evidence and requests and appeal against the decisions of the investigators, prosecutors or a court. 39. The Civil Code provides: “1. Non-pecuniary damage shall be deemed to be a person’s suffering, emotional experiences, inconvenience, mental shock, emotional depression, humiliation, deterioration of reputation, diminution of possibilities to associate with others, and so on, evaluated by a court in terms of money. 2. Non-pecuniary damage shall be compensated for only in cases provided for by laws. Non-pecuniary damage shall be compensated for in all cases where it has been incurred due to crime, health impairment or deprivation of life, as well as in other cases provided for by laws. The courts shall, when assessing the amount of non-pecuniary damage, take into consideration the consequences of such damage being sustained, the gravity of the fault of the person by whom the damage is caused, his financial status, the amount of pecuniary damage sustained by the aggrieved person, also any other circumstances of importance for the case, while abiding by the criteria of good faith, justice and reasonableness.” “1. If damage has been caused by the collapse of buildings, construction works, installations or other structures, including roads, or if the damage has been caused by any defect thereof, the owner (manager) shall be liable for damages unless he can prove that the situation has occurred because of circumstances indicated in Paragraph 1 of Article 6.270 of this Code. 2. It shall be presumed that the owner (manager) of buildings, construction works, installations or other structures is the person indicated as their owner (manager) in the Public Register.” “1. Damage caused by unlawful acts of institutions of public authority must be compensated for by the State from the State budget, irrespective of the responsibility of a particular public servant or other employee of public authority institutions. Damage caused by unlawful actions of municipal authority bodies must be redressed by the municipality from its own budget, irrespective of whether an employee is at fault. 2. For the purposes of this Article, “public authority institution” means any entity of public law (including a State or municipal institution, official, public servant or any other employee of these institutions), as well as private individuals executing functions of public authority. 3. For the purposes of this Article, “action” means any action (active or passive) of an institution of public authority or its employees that directly affects the rights, liberties and interests of persons (including legal acts or individual acts adopted by the institutions of State and municipal authority, administrative acts, physical acts, with the exception of court judgments – verdicts in criminal cases, decisions in civil and administrative cases and orders). 4. Civil liability of the State or municipality, subject to this Article, shall arise where employees of public authority institutions fail to act in the manner prescribed by laws for these institutions and their employees.” 40. The Government provided Lithuanian court decisions concerning effective remedies in personal injury or destruction of property cases. They firstly noted the Supreme Court’s ruling of 11 October 2005 in civil case 3K-7-365/2005, in which the Tauragė city municipality had been held liable for the improper maintenance of the drainage system. The municipality was held accountable under Article 6.266 of the Civil Code for the injuries the claimant had sustained and ordered to pay LTL 15,000 for the non-pecuniary damage she had sustained by falling into a sewer well. 41. As the second example the Government referred to the Klaipėda Regional Court’s ruling of 21 July 2010 in civil case 2A-421-253/2010, in which the claimant claimed damages for a broken clavicle suffered by her son, who had fallen into an uncovered cellar. The court concluded that the municipality’s department responsible for maintenance of the buildings had failed to act with due diligence and, on the basis of Article 6.250 of the Civil Code, awarded the child’s mother LTL 2,500 in non-pecuniary damages. 42. Lastly, the Government noted the Supreme Court’s ruling of 13 November 2005 in civil case 3K-3-584/2005, concerning liability in tort of the building owners, under Article 6.266 of the Civil Code. The Supreme Court held that the owner (manager) of the buildings, installations and other structures had absolute (no-fault) responsibility for damage caused by its collapse or deficiencies. In that case the Vilnius city municipality was determined to be the owner of the premises in question and therefore liable for the pecuniary damage caused by the rupture of a water pipe. The municipality was to compensate the claimant for destruction of its property in the amount of LTL 7,300.",['2'],['2-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Chişinău. He works for “Social Amnesty”, an organisation which provides legal help to persons in detention. 6. On 11 October 2000 the applicant underwent an operation to drain fluid from his liver. He was released from hospital on 21 October 2000. 7. On 23 October 2000 he was arrested by the Department for Fighting Organised Crime and Corruption on suspicion of fraud and was placed in detention at the Hînceşti police station. He alleged that he was suspended from an iron bar and beaten with machine guns and rubber truncheons and that the beating re-opened his surgical wound. He was placed in a small cell in the police station, without a bed, mattress or blankets and without access to a toilet or washing facilities, where he had to sleep on the concrete floor. He was seen by a doctor on 29 October 2000, who observed that the applicant's surgical wound had reopened and recommended that he be admitted to hospital immediately. However, police officer Ş. refused a transfer to the hospital. 8. On 6 November 2000 the applicant was transferred to prison no. 13, where he was placed into the medical treatment unit with the diagnosis “post-surgery state” (see further Ciorap v. Moldova, no. 12066/02, 19 June 2007). According to medical reports, on 7 November 2000 the applicant swallowed a nail and was hospitalised in order to extract it. According to medical evidence, during 2000-2001 the applicant underwent 10 operations made necessary by acts of self-harm, such as swallowing sharp objects and cutting himself (see Ciorap v. Moldova (dec.), no. 12066/02, 11 October 2005). 9. The applicant made a number of complaints in respect of his alleged ill-treatment by the police, the failure to give him medical treatment and the inhuman conditions of detention. The prosecutor opened a criminal investigation and interviewed the applicant, the police officers involved and their colleagues, as well as the medical personnel who had examined the applicant during his arrest. The doctors confirmed that they had been called twice to attend the applicant on the night of his arrest but that this had been in connection with a post-surgery problem. The prosecutor found that the applicant had made no complaint of ill-treatment when examined by the doctors or by the superior police officers (see Ciorap v. Moldova (dec.), no. 12066/02, 11 October 2005). All the applicant's complaints were dismissed as unfounded. This decision was confirmed by the investigating judge on 21 June 2006 and 30 October 2006. 10. In a final judgment of 7 November 2006 the Supreme Court of Justice found that on 7 October 2002 and 29 April 2003 the applicant had been informed of the prosecutor's decision to reject his request for the initiation of a criminal investigation into his alleged torture in October 2000. He was also informed of his right to challenge that decision in court within ten days of the date on which he was informed of it. However, the applicant did not challenge that decision until three years later, without having asked for an extension of the time-limit. The court therefore rejected his complaint for failure to challenge the prosecutor's decision within the time-limit provided for by law. 11. On an unspecified date, the applicant initiated new court proceedings against the Hînceşti police station, the Prosecutor's Office and the Ministry of Finance, claiming compensation for the damage caused to him through his ill-treatment upon his arrest on 23 October 2000, the failure to give him medical treatment while in detention and the inhuman conditions of detention. 12. On 15 March 2007 the Hînceşti District Court rejected his claims as unfounded. On 7 June 2007 the Chişinău Court of Appeal quashed that judgment and partly accepted the applicant's claims. The court found that the documents in the file established that police officer Ş. had refused to allow the applicant to be treated in hospital even though an urgent examination by a surgeon had been recommended by the doctor who saw the applicant on 29 October 2000. The court also found that the applicant had been detained at Hînceşti police station in conditions that breached the requirements of domestic law. In particular, the Law on preventive arrest (no. 1226-XIII, 27 June 1997) required that individuals detained pre-trial had a minimum of two square metres of cell space, access to daylight and fresh air, access to a toilet in sanitary conditions not degrading human dignity, access to a shower once every ten days and access to a bed with bed linen. The court referred to a letter from the Ministry of Interior which acknowledged that at the time of the applicant's detention Hînceşti police station had been insufficiently equipped to offer appropriate conditions of detention, including proper ventilation. The court awarded the applicant 100 Moldovan lei (MDL) (6 euros (EUR) at the time) for non-pecuniary damage caused. The applicant appealed. 13. On 21 November 2007 the Supreme Court of Justice accepted the applicant's appeal in cassation and partly quashed the lower court's judgment. The court confirmed the findings of the Chişinău Court of Appeal concerning the failure to give the applicant required medical treatment and to provide the applicant with adequate conditions of detention. In reaching this conclusion, the court referred to Article 3 of the Convention and the Court's judgments such as Kudła v. Poland [GC] (no. 30210/96, ECHR 2000XI), Sarban v. Moldova (no. 3456/05, 4 October 2005) and Ostrovar v. Moldova (no. 35207/03, 13 September 2005). The court added that while there was no domestic legislation giving the applicant a right to compensation, the Convention should be applied directly as it was part of the domestic legal system and had precedence over domestic legislation by virtue of the express provisions of Article 4 of the Constitution. The same conclusion had been reached by the Constitutional Court in a judgment of 14 October 1999. The court also relied on the findings of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment made during its visits in 1998, 2001 and 2004 concerning the substandard conditions of detention in the Hînceşti police station. The court held that the denial of medical treatment combined with the conditions of detention, which had aggravated the applicant's medical condition, had amounted to inhuman treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention. The court increased the award made to the applicant in compensation for non-pecuniary damage to MDL 10,000 (EUR 600 at the time) and awarded him MDL 210 (EUR 12.6) in compensation for pecuniary damage. 14. The applicant again requested the Hînceşti Prosecutor's Office to open a criminal investigation into his alleged ill-treatment by the police, but the prosecutor rejected the request. The applicant challenged this decision before the Hînceşti investigating judge and subsequently the Supreme Court, which dismissed his appeal on 1 October 2008.",['3'],[],[],[],[],[],1
187,001-81779,ENG,TUR,CHAMBER,2007,CASE OF HALIS TEKIN v. TURKEY,4,Violation of Art. 6-1;No violation of Art. 6-1,David Thór Björgvinsson,"5. The applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Batman. 6. On 22 May 1994 the applicant was arrested in the course of an armed clash between members of the security forces and terrorist militants. 7. On 27 May 1994 the applicant's statements were taken by police officers. 8. On 30 May 1994 he was brought before the public prosecutor at the Diyarbakır State Security Court. The public prosecutor questioned him in relation to his involvement in terrorist acts. On the same day, the applicant was brought before a single judge of the Diyarbakır State Security Court who ordered his detention on remand. 9. On 13 June 1994 the Diyarbakır Public Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment charging the applicant with carrying out activities for the purpose of bringing about the secession of part of the national territory. The charges were brought under Article 125 of the now defunct Criminal Code. 10. On 20 January 1995 the Diyarbakır State Security Court held a hearing in the presence of a military judge. The applicant admitted that he was a member of an illegal organisation, namely the ARGK. 11. At the hearing on 30 January 1995 before the Diyarbakır State Security Court, the applicant stated that he was a “guerrilla” of the ARGK and apologised to his people and party for not being worthy of the organisation since he had failed to carry out the acts that he had undertaken. He however denied the veracity of the statements which he had given to the police officers. 12. Between 3 April 1995 and 30 October 1995 the Diyarbakır State Security Court held four hearings and issued decisions to the effect that the case-files concerning other criminal proceedings instituted against the applicant should be obtained from the other courts. 13. On 8 December 1995 the Diyarbakır State Security Court decided to join two cases concerning different accusations against the applicant. It further decided to wait for the arrival of the case-files. The number of accused who were tried together with the applicant attained thirteen in total. 14. Between 24 January 1996 and 14 May 1997 the Diyarbakır State Security Court held eight hearings and postponed each of them with a view to remedying certain procedural shortcomings in respect of the applicant's co-accused. 15. The applicant attended the hearing of 3 July 1997 and claimed that he was under pressure in the prison and that he was hindered from appearing before the court. He did not specify who prevented him from appearing before the court. The court again postponed the hearing with a view to determining the address of one of the applicant's co-accused. 16. The applicant and his co-accused did not attend the hearing of 14 August 1997. 17. The Diyarbakır State Security Court postponed the hearings of 22 October 1997, 10 December 1997, 12 February 1998 and 19 March 1998 pending the arrest of one of the applicant's co-accused. The court also asked the public prosecutor to submit his observations on the merits. 18. On 21 May 1998 the public prosecutor submitted his observations on the merits of the case and sought the conviction of the applicant for the offence under Article 125 of the former Criminal Code. The applicant asked for time to prepare his defence. 19. The applicant did not attend the hearings of 16 July 1998, 10 September 1998 and 5 November 1998. At the hearing held on the latter date, the court decided to inform the accused that their defence submissions would be assumed to have been given if they did not attend the next hearing scheduled for 24 December 1998. 20. The applicant did not attend the hearing of 24 December 1998 and submitted a declaration on behalf of himself and all his co-accused that they would not attend the hearing. The court decided to request the prison authorities to ensure the attendance of the applicant and his co-accused at the hearing of 4 March 1999. 21. The applicant refused to attend the hearings of 4 March 1999, 24 April 1999, 17 June 1999 and 29 July 1999 in protest against the arrest of Abdullah Öcalan. 22. Meanwhile, on 18 June 1999 the Grand National Assembly amended Article 143 of the Constitution and excluded military members from the state security courts. Following similar amendments made on 22 June 1999 to the Law on the State Security Courts, the military judge sitting on the bench of the Diyarbakır State Security Court hearing the applicant's case was replaced by a civilian judge. 23. The applicant attended the hearing held on 23 September 1999 and read out his defence submissions. The court informed the accused that the final judgment would be delivered on 11 November 1999 even if they refused to attend the hearing. 24. On 11 November 1999 the Diyarbakır State Security Court composed of three civilian judges, convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to death under Article 125 of the Criminal Code. Taking into account the applicant's behaviour during the trial, the death penalty was commuted to a life sentence. The applicant appealed. 25. On 2 May 2000 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the Diyarbakır State Security Court. 26. The relevant domestic law and practice in force at the material time are outlined in the following judgments: Özel v. Turkey (no. 42739/98, §§ 20-21, 7 November 2002), Öcalan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, §§ 5254, ECHR 2005-...). 27.

The applicants were born in 1981, 1983 and 1981 respectively and live in Şanlıurfa. 5. The applicants were arrested and taken into custody on 19 and 20 February 1999 respectively on suspicion of their involvement in the throwing of Molotov cocktails at various public buildings. On 23 February 1999 the Suruç Magistrates' Court ordered their remand in custody. The applicants were aged sixteen (Mehmet Koşti) and eighteen (the other applicants) at the time of the events. 6. On 23 March 1999 the public prosecutor at the Diyarbakır State Security Court filed a bill of indictment against the applicants and four other persons, accusing them of throwing Molotov cocktails at the Suruç primary school and the Suruç public garage on 18 February 1999 and of attempting to throw Molotov cocktail at the Suruç Atatürk primary school with a view to supporting the activities of an illegal organisation, namely the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers' Party). The charges were brought under Article 168 § 2 of the Turkish Criminal Code. 7. On 7 April 1999 the criminal proceedings against the applicants and four other accused commenced before the Diyarbakır State Security Court. 8. On 12 May 1999 the court heard the applicants who refuted the allegations against them and their earlier submissions given before the police, public prosecutor and the Magistrates' Court. They also challenged the accuracy of the arrest protocol and the report on the reconstruction of the events. The court decided to secure the testimony of those who had attended the arrest and the reconstruction of events and the submissions of the accused who were not detained. It further ordered that the birth date of Hışman Öngör and another accused be determined since they had claimed that they were actually born in 1986. 9. Between 12 May 1999 and 22 December 2000, the Diyarbakır Security Court held fifteen hearings where it took various procedural decisions and postponed the trial as the procedure concerning the determination of the age of two accused had not been completed. 10. At the hearings held on 22 December 2000 and 20 February 2001 respectively, the court requested the prosecution and the defendants to submit their observations on the merits of the case. On 10 April 2001 the applicants' lawyer requested an extension for the submission of the applicants' observations. This request was accepted by the court. 11. Throughout the proceedings the applicants' lawyer repeatedly requested that the applicants be released pending trial. He maintained, inter alia, that they were juveniles and that their acts could not be considered to constitute an offence under Article 168 § 2 of the Criminal Court. The first instance court dismissed the applicants' requests until 29 May 2001, having regard to the nature of the offence with which they were charged and the state of the evidence. 12. On 29 May 2001 the court decided to defer sentencing the applicants and their co-accused, pursuant to Law no. 4616. It therefore ordered the release of the applicants from detention. 13. The public prosecutor appealed. 14. On 20 September 2001 the Court of Cassation upheld the decision of the first instance court. 15.

FINLAND,4,Violation of Art. 6-1,David Thór Björgvinsson;Giovanni Bonello;Ján Šikuta;Lech Garlicki;Nebojša Vučinić;Nicolas Bratza;Päivi Hirvelä,"4. The applicant company has its seat in Nastola and the second and third applicants live in Villähde and Orimattila respectively. 5. The applicant company has operated a service station in Nastola since 1965. The service station is located in the industrial zone of the municipality which is situated in a groundwater basin. The second and third applicants are the only owners of the applicant company. 6. In 1998 new regulations concerning handling and storage of dangerous chemicals (including fuels for motor vehicles) entered into force and service stations needed to comply with these new requirements by 31 December 2002. In order to comply with the new regulations, the applicant company had to undertake some restructuring works. 7. On 1 March 2000 the Environmental Protection Act (ympäristönsuojelulaki, miljöskyddslagen, Act No. 86/2000) entered into force requiring, inter alia, an environmental permit to be held for activities which might cause environmental pollution. As the activities of the applicant company fell within the scope of application of the Act, it applied for an environmental permit for the restructuring works on 8 December 2000. More specifically, the application concerned an environmental permit for enlarging the storage capacity of liquid fuel. 8. On 20 March 2001 the Nastola Environmental Board (ympäristölautakunta, miljönämnden) granted the applicant company the permit and set several conditions for the restructuring works. 9. By letter of 17 April 2001, the Häme Regional Environment Centre (ympäristökeskus, miljöcentralen) appealed against the Board’s decision to the Vaasa Administrative Court (hallinto-oikeus, förvaltningsdomstolen) claiming that, despite the proposed protective measures, there was still a risk that the quality of groundwater could be jeopardised and that the environmental permit should therefore be withdrawn. 10. On 26 October 2001 the Administrative Court rejected the Centre’s appeal but amended one of the conditions for the permit. 11. By a letter of 22 November 2001, the Centre appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (korkein hallinto-oikeus, högsta förvaltningsdomstolen), reiterating the grounds of appeal relied on before the Administrative Court. 12. On 11 February 2003 the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the decisions of the Board and the Administrative Court and referred the case back to the Board, ordering it to clarify whether it was possible to eliminate the risk of pollution of groundwater by using more efficient protective measures. The court found that the activity in question was to be compared to a new activity as regards the environmental permit as this was the first time that the effects of the activities on groundwater were being assessed. The environmental permit could not be granted as the applicant company had not shown that the proposed protective measures would eliminate the risk of pollution of the groundwater. 13. On 29 April 2005 the applicant company lodged an amended application for an environmental permit with the Nastola Environmental Board. More specifically, this application concerned an environmental permit for reducing the storage capacity of liquid fuel. On 13 December 2005 the Board decided to grant the permit with several conditions. 14. By letter dated 18 January 2006 the Häme Regional Environment Centre again appealed against the Board’s decision to the Vaasa Administrative Court, claiming that the environmental permit should be withdrawn. 15. On 29 December 2006 the Administrative Court rejected the appeal, considering that sufficient protective measures were included in the permit. 16. By letter dated 29 January 2007 the Centre appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court, reiterating the grounds of appeal relied on before the Administrative Court. 17. On 19 December 2007 the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the decisions of the Board and the Administrative Court. It found that, even though the protective measures proposed by the company diminished the risk of pollution of groundwater, they could not guarantee the protection of groundwater under all circumstances. 18. As the applicant company was refused the permit, it was ordered to close down the service station by 31 December 2008.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicants were born in 1968 and 1936 respectively and live in Paris. 9. The first applicant was born on 6 December 1968 of a relationship which began in 1964 between the second applicant, a widow and the mother of a daughter born in 1957, and Mr R. Merger, a married man and the father of four children born in 1942, 1944, 1945 and 1947. At the time her birth, her father and mother had been living together since 1965. Her father formally acknowledged paternity on 7 December 1973 and she has borne his name since 17 May 1985. 10. On 11 May 1980 the first applicant's father drew up a private deed dividing his movable property between his five children. The document was signed by the four legitimate children and by the father on the first applicant's behalf. 11. On 11 October 1984 he made a manuscript will in which he left to the first applicant the disposable portion of his estate which, pursuant to Article 913 of the Civil Code, came to one quarter. He stipulated that it was to be taken free of his wife's life interest. 12. In a second manuscript will dated 16 June 1985 he stated that he wished the estate to be divided into five parts to be allocated by the drawing of lots in the presence of all his children, for the disposable portion of the estate to pass to the first applicant after an account had been taken of any gifts that had been made and for his wife's life interest to attach only to the share of the four legitimate children. The first applicant was to receive a reversionary pension for the duration of her studies and these were to be paid for if the law so permitted. 13. The first applicant's father died on 12 March 1986 leaving as his heirs his wife, four legitimate children and the first applicant, an illegitimate child conceived while he was bound by marriage to a person other than its mother. 14. A notary was instructed to wind up the estate. He took an inventory at the home on 20 June 1986. The first applicant (who was sitting her baccalaureate that day) was represented by the second applicant, who pointed out that certain movables were missing. The widow laid claim to certain items which she said belonged to her. The total value of the movables listed in the inventory was estimated at 114,175 French francs (FRF). 15. Since an amicable division of the estate proved impossible, the deceased's four legitimate children and their mother brought proceedings against the applicants in the Paris tribunal de grande instance seeking, inter alia, orders setting aside the gift of the disposable portion to the first applicant and the gifts their father had made to the second applicant – which were deemed to have been made to the first applicant – and restricting the first applicant's rights to 10 % of the net estate. 16. The applicants asked the Court, inter alia, to dismiss the claims and to order the claimants to hand over to the first applicant all the movable property she had been allocated on 11 May 1980. 17. In a judgment of 6 November 1992, the tribunal de grande instance found that funds that had been used to purchase a flat in the avenue d'Italie in Paris and a sum of FRF 500,000 were gifts that had been made to the first applicant through an intermediary and set them aside under Articles 908 and 911 of the Civil Code. It added that the value of the property that had been acquired with those gifts had to be brought into account. Relying on those provisions, the tribunal de grande instance ruled that the first applicant was not entitled to more than 10% of the estate and held that the gift of the disposable portion was inoperative. Relying principally on Article 931 of the Civil Code, it held that the deed of division dated 11 May 1980 was null and void as it was not in the correct form and added, in the alternative, that the first applicant could only lay claim to 10% of the movables that were divisible in kind. Lastly, it declared that the first applicant was to receive her share of the estate free of any life interest. 18. The applicants appealed against that judgment. The first applicant completed her studies in December 1993. 19. In a judgment of 24 September 1996, the Paris Court of Appeal transferred the case to the Dijon Court of Appeal, as one of the parties was a judge of the Paris tribunal de grande instance and the other had been admitted to the Paris Bar while the proceedings were under way. 20. In a judgment of 27 November 1997, the Dijon Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the court below in so far as it had refused to grant the first applicant identical inheritance rights to those of the four legitimate children or to allow her to take the disposable portion and had ruled that the assets of the second applicant – who it noted had lived with the deceased since 1965 – were gifts acquired through an intermediary. Noting that the first applicant was an illegitimate child who had been conceived when her father was bound by marriage to a person other than her mother, it declared her claim to a reversionary pension inadmissible as she was not prepared to abandon her rights to the estate. 21. The applicants appealed to the Court of Cassation. 22. On 4 February 1999 the notary liquidated the estate and drew up the deed of division. The first applicant signed the deed “without prejudice to the appeal to the Court of Cassation which has been served on the parties”. Under the terms of the deed of division, she was required to pay an equalising balance to the other heirs in the French franc equivalent of 236,187 euros (EUR). 23. The second applicant sold her home to pay that balance on behalf of her daughter, who had no property of her own. 24. In a judgment of 3 May 2000, the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants' appeal. 25. Following that judgment, the equalising balance was duly paid to the other heirs. 26. The relevant provisions of the Civil Code as worded at the material time were as follows: “Part I: Succession ... Chapter III: Orders of succession ... Section III: Rights of descendants to inherit “Children or their issue shall inherit from their father and mother, grandfathers, grandmothers or other ascendants, without distinction on grounds of sex or primogeniture, and even if born of different marriages. The estate shall devolve upon them in equal portions and per capita if they are all first degree issue and heirs in their own right; they shall inherit per stirpes if all or some of them inherit through their ascendants. ... Section VI: Rights of illegitimate children to inherit Illegitimate children shall, in general, have the same rights to inherit from their father and mother or other ascendants and from their brothers and sisters and other collateral relatives as legitimate children. Illegitimate children whose father or mother was, at the time of their conception, bound by a marriage to another person shall not prevent such other person from inheriting from the father or mother if he or she would have been entitled to inherit under Articles 765 and 766 below but for their birth. In such eventuality, irrespective of their number, the illegitimate children shall receive only half of that which would have devolved to the spouse under the aforementioned Articles but for their birth, the calculation being made line by line... Illegitimate children whose father or mother was, at the time of their conception, bound by a marriage of which legitimate children were born shall be entitled to inherit from that parent in competition with the legitimate children; however, they shall each receive only half of the share to which they would have been entitled if all the children of the deceased, including themselves, had been legitimate. The fraction by which their share of the estate is thus reduced shall revert solely to the children born of the marriage damaged by the adultery. It shall be divided between them in proportion to their share in the estate. Titre II: Inter vivos and testamentary gifts ... Chapter II: Capacity to use or receive inter vivos and testamentary gifts Illegitimate children shall not be entitled to receive by way of inter vivos or testamentary gift from their father or mother a share of the estate in excess of that to which they are entitled under the aforementioned Articles 759 and 760 if the donor or testator was, at the time of their conception, bound by marriage to another person. An action for abatement may, however, only be brought by the spouse or children of the marriage, as the case may be, and only once the estate has passed to the heirs. Any disposition to a person without capacity shall be null and void, whether disguised as a contract for consideration or made in the name of intermediaries. The father, mother, children, descendants, and spouse of a person without capacity shall be deemed to be intermediaries. ... Chapter III: The portion of disposable assets and abatement ... Section I: The portion of disposable assets Gifts, whether inter vivos or testamentary, may not exceed one half of the donor's assets if on his death he leaves only one legitimate child, one-third if he leaves two or one quarter if he leaves three or more. An illegitimate child whose share in the estate has abated pursuant to Articles 759 and 760 may, if in need, claim maintenance from the estate in exchange for abandoning his or her rights in favour of the heirs. Such maintenance shall be governed by Article 207-1 of this Code. The heirs may, however, settle such a claim by granting the applicant a share equal to that which he or she would have received under Article 759 and 760. ... Chapter IV: Inter vivos gifts ... Section I : Formal requirements for inter vivos gifts Any deed providing for an inter vivos gift shall be made before a notary in the ordinary form applicable to contracts; an original shall be kept by the notary, on pain of nullity.” 27. On 4 December 2001 Law no. 2001-1135 of 3 December 2001 “on the rights of the surviving spouse and children born of adultery and modernising various provisions of the law of succession” was published in the Official Gazette. It abolished any difference in treatment of illegitimate children one of whose parents was, at the time of their conception, bound by marriage to another person. It repealed the provisions of the Civil Code (in particular, Articles 759, 760, 908 and 915-2) that gave children whose father or mother was married to another person at the time of their conception less favourable inheritance rights. It also repealed the provisions that protected the spouse alone if he or she was competing solely with such children. 28. The Montpellier tribunal de grande instance held as follows in a judgment of 2 May 2003: “Since it creates a difference between children's inheritance rights depending on their birth, the application of Article 760 of the Civil Code violates the provisions of the Convention ..., as the European Court recently held (in its judgment of 1 February 2000 in the case which Mr Mazurek brought against the French State). ... Thus, Article 760 of the Civil Code must be disregarded, as it contains provisions that discriminate against children of an adulterous relationship with no properly justified basis and it is inconsistent with the European Convention on Human Rights, which, by virtue of Article 55 of the Constitution, ranks ahead of the provisions of domestic law and, in accordance with settled case-law, is directly applicable by the French courts.”","['14', '8', 'P1']",['P1-1'],[],"['14', 'P1']",['P1-1'],[],1

The applicant was born in 1977. He lives in Bucharest. 6. On 21 November 2001 the Bucharest Appeal Court found the applicant guilty of robbery and two traffic offences and sentenced him to eleven years’ imprisonment. 7. He started serving his sentence in Jilava Prison, where he was detained from 28 February 2001 to 4 March 2002; from 27 April 2002 to 23 January 2003; from 28 January to 3rd July 2003; and from 20 February 2006 to 4 December 2008. He also served a part of his sentence in Giurgiu prison from 3rd July 2003 to 26 February 2005; from 5 March 2005 to 11 February 2006; and from 25 February to 23 April 2009. 8. The further circumstances on the applicant’s conditions of detention are in dispute between the parties. 9. The applicant complained about the conditions of his detention, summarised below, in both Jilava and Giurgiu prisons. He regularly complained thereof and about the disciplinary measures taken against him to the delegate judge, who dismissed most of his complaints. For instance, in a decision of 23 March 2007, the delegate judge to Jilava Prison rejected the applicant’s complaints that he did not fully benefit from the rights granted to him by the Regulations implementing Law no. 275/2006, adopted by Decree no. 1897/2006, on the ground, inter alia, that the legal force of the regulations was inferior to that of the law, and that therefore the prison administration was under no obligation to grant detainees rights which were not provided for by Law no. 275/2006 itself. 10. The cell lacked basic hygiene, it was infested with lice, bugs and rats, the blankets were in a poor condition and the mattresses were dirty. Although the cell was very small and it was only big enough for two to three people, there were nine beds and twelve inmates in the cell (sometimes even fourteen to fifteen). 11. The cell window was very small and the cell lacked natural light. Due to the size of the window, the cell was not properly ventilated. The air was even more difficult to breathe as his cellmates were smokers, and the applicant was thus exposed to smoke almost all day long. 12. As the sanitary facilities were separated from the rest of the cell only by a makeshift partition, the smell was unbearable. 13. The water was undrinkable. 14. In addition, the applicant alleges that his daily walk schedule was not observed and that his access to cultural and educational activities was limited. 15. The conditions were similar to those in Jilava Prison: the cell was overcrowded and lacked basic hygiene; also, there were no educational and cultural activities and the walk schedule was not observed. 16. He was detained alone in a cell for more than eight months, from July 2003 to February/March 2004. During that period he had no contact with the outside world, his rights to receive visits or parcels and to make phone calls were heavily restricted, the window could not be opened and he could only go out for walks on the roof of the prison building, handcuffed, and in a group of no more than five or six prisoners. 17. On 19 March 2004 the applicant was categorised as “dangerous” and treated as such, including during his transfer from Jilava Prison to Giurgiu Prison. This measure was regularly renewed. However, the applicant considered that the decisions to categorise him as dangerous had lacked any factual basis and pointed out that since 29 March 2003 he had not committed any act of indiscipline and had integrated very well into prison life. 18. Being categorised as a dangerous prisoner had serious consequences. His rights to receive visits, parcels and correspondence were restricted, and sometimes even withdrawn. The applicant frequently had to file actions with the courts each time there was a restriction of his right to receive parcels and correspondence; most of his complaints about that were allowed by the domestic courts. However, the decision to categorise him as dangerous had other consequences: it prevented him from participating in a number of activities in the prison, and even restricted his movement; for instance, his hands were handcuffed behind his back whenever he was moved, which proved very painful. 19. Generally, the prison staff had a hostile attitude towards him. 20. On 4 July 2004 he was taken from Giurgiu Prison to Giurgiu County Court for a hearing. He did not receive any food or water until he was taken back to Giurgiu Prison. 21. The Government submitted in their observations that in general, the conditions in Jilava Prison were adequate. In 2001 and 2002 there had been a problem with the overcrowding of the cells, but as of 2003 the situation had improved, and in each cell the number of detainees corresponded to the number of beds at the most. Each cell had power supply, natural light and natural ventilation through the windows. In summer time, the cell doors remained open, being closed off only by grids for better ventilation. 22. Each cell was equipped with tables, chairs, benches and a hallstand. The cells were cleaned by the prisoners, the necessary materials being provided by the prison administration. Disinfestation services were provided by professionals at least once every three months. The sanitary facilities were cleaned every morning with disinfectants. Whenever necessary, the cells were cleaned with disinfectants. Every week, upon request, the clothing of the detainees was washed. 23. Drinking water was permanently available. The quality of the water was checked monthly by a company under contract with the prison administration; according to the reports of that company, the water was drinkable. 24. The applicant was detained in cells nos. 203, 304, 307, 210, 208, 405, 404, 401, 403, 412. During 2001-2003 the applicant was entitled to a daily thirty-minute walk; after Law no. 275/2006 entered into force in July 2006, he was entitled to a three-hour walk. In 2006 and 2007 the applicant also took part in educative programmes. 25. The fact that the applicant was registered as a detainee with an increased degree of risk did not restrict his right to receive packages, visits, or correspondence; however, appropriate security measures were taken when granting these rights. Moreover, the applicant complained dozens of times both about the security measures and the way they interfered with his rights, as well as about the improper conditions of his detention. The delegated judge often granted the applicant’s appeals concerning disciplinary sanctions against him. The appeals concerning his registration as dangerous and the material conditions of detention were dismissed, on the ground that no breach of law could be found. For instance, on 25 May 2007, the applicant’s complaints about the improper material conditions in his cell and about the lack of medical treatment by a dentist were dismissed by the delegate judge. He found, upon examination of the information submitted to him by Jilava Prison administration, that the conditions of the applicant’s detention did not amount to inhuman or degrading treatment and that, although there was no dentist in Jilava Prison, a competition for hiring a dentist in that prison was being organised by the Ministry of Justice. The delegated judge concluded that no breach of Law no. 275/2006 could be found. 26. The cells in the prison had two or six beds, and were equipped in compliance with the law. Each detainee had an individual bed and a bedroll. 27. The two-bed detention cells measured 10.24 square metres, access to natural light and ventilation through four windows, and were equipped with one sink with utensils, one television stand, one table, one 220V lamp and one night watch light. 28. The six-bed detention rooms measured 21.76 square metres, access to natural light and ventilation through six windows, and were equipped with one sink with utensils, one television stand, three tables, one bench, a hallstand, one 220V lamp and one night watch lamp. 29. The sanitary facility was separated from the detention room and conformed to hygiene standards and privacy requirements. The detention rooms and water for twice weekly baths were heated by the prison’s own power station. Drinking and non-drinking water was provided by the Giurgiu city supply network and was checked periodically. 30. The applicant was registered as a detainee with an increased degree of risk, and therefore security measures were taken when according his rights. For instance, his daily walk took place in one of the eight courtyards specially designed for very dangerous detainees, located on block C. 31. Between July 2003 and March 2004 the applicant was detained alone in a cell equipped in a similar way to the other cells. After March 2004 the applicant shared his cell with another detainee. The daily programme was respected by the prison administration, his rights to visits and packages were observed, and he was even able to participate in the football games organised by the penitentiary authorities. 32. The applicant’s registration as a detainee with an increased degree of risk was well-founded and repeatedly prolonged throughout his detention in Giurgiu Prison. The applicant complained dozens of times about his conditions of detention, including material conditions, lack of medical treatment and restrictions to his rights as a result of his registration as dangerous. The delegated judge often granted the applicant’s appeals concerning disciplinary sanctions against him. The appeals concerning his registration as dangerous and the material conditions of detention were dismissed, on the ground that no breach of law could be found. 33. The circumstances surrounding the events on 10 and 11 November 2005 are in dispute between the parties. 34. The applicant alleged that on 10 and 11 November 2005, while in Giurgiu Prison, he had been beaten by members of the Giurgiu Prison intervention squad wearing balaclavas. His requests to be examined by a forensic doctor immediately after the violent incidents had been ignored. He further alleged that he had immediately duly informed the prison authorities about the violent behaviour of the members of the intervention squad. 35. The Government submitted in their observations that on 10 November 2005, upon his return from a court hearing, the applicant had asked to be taken to the prison store room to pick up some personal effects. The officers had informed him that his request would be granted only after all the formalities applicable to detainees returning from court to their cells had been complied with. Unhappy that his request had not been granted immediately, the applicant had become violent, and while he was being taken to the detention room, he had managed to undo his handcuffs and hit C.C., one of the members of the intervention unit, in the face. The incident was settled calmly and the applicant was placed in his cell without further difficulty. The next day C.C. had been taken to a doctor, who had established that he had “a minor head injury of level 0-1”, which required nine days of medical treatment. 36. The applicant also alleged that on 14 November 2005, during the morning call, he had been hit and insulted by a supervising officer, N.I., and two members of the intervention unit. 37. After the incidents on 10, 11 and 14 November 2005, the applicant lodged with the Prosecution Office attached to the Giurgiu District Court a criminal complaint against the following prison officers: a) C.C. and other members of the intervention unit, for hitting him on the evening of 10 November 2005 upon his return from a court hearing; b) S.C., S.V., C.C. and other members of the intervention unit for allegedly beating, threatening and insulting him on 11 November 2005; c) prison warden I.N. for allegedly insulting and hitting him during the morning call on 14 November 2005. 38. On 24 November 2005 the applicant was brought before the Giurgiu District Court concerning his request that the prison administration’s decision to grade him as a “dangerous detainee” be revoked (see paragraph 18 above). During the hearing, he complained that he had been repeatedly beaten in Giurgiu Prison by State agents and that his body still bore bruises, and that he suffered pain in the right rib cage. He also indicated that he had filed complaints with the prosecutor and the prison administration, asking to see a doctor, but that he had received no answer. The court took note of the criminal complaints lodged by the applicant and forwarded them to the prosecutor for further investigation. It also ordered the Giurgiu Prison administration to allow a doctor to see the applicant in order to have a medical certificate drawn up in relation to his allegations of ill-treatment. 39. Following the Giurgiu District Court’s order, the applicant was examined by a doctor the next day, on 25 November 2005. A forensic medical report was drawn up, indicating multiple bruises in the area of the applicant’s thighs and lower legs, which were deemed to still require some two to three days’ medical treatment. The report also stated that the bruises could have been caused on 10 or 11 November 2005 by impact with hard objects. 40. On 12 December 2005 the Prosecution Office indicted the applicant for assault on a State agent, for having hit C.C. on 10 November 2005 (see paragraphs 46 et seq. below). 41. On 31 October 2006 the Prosecution Office decided not to open criminal proceedings against I.N. in relation to the alleged incident on 14 November 2005, on the ground that the complaint had not been substantiated. The prosecution established that the only witness who had supported the applicant’s version of events, S.M., had not been an eyewitness; he had only heard screams and shouting involving the applicant and I.N from his cell. The other witnesses, who had been sharing the cell with the applicant, had not seen anything. 42. The decision not to open criminal proceedings against I.N. was upheld by the higher prosecutor on 22 January 2007. 43. On 20 March 2008 Giurgiu County Court upheld the decision not to open proceedings. The court reached this decision upon examination of the file produced by the prosecution, without any evidence being administered or any witnesses being heard. 44. On 12 December 2006 the Prosecution Office decided not to open criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged incidents of 10 and 11 November. The prosecutor established that on 10 November 2005, due to the fact that the applicant had been denied a particular request, he had succeeded in freeing one hand from his handcuffs and hitting one of the agents of the special intervention unit, C.C., in the face. The intervention squad had managed to immobilize the applicant. The prosecutor considered that the forensic certificate drawn up on 25 November 2005 could not constitute evidence showing that the injuries had been inflicted by I.N. and C.C., since there was a possibility that those injuries had been inflicted during the immobilization of the applicant. The prosecutor further indicated that the statements made by those witnesses who were also detainees were subjective, due to the fact that they had been the applicant’s fellow inmates; moreover, they had presented the facts differently. 45. The decision not to open criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged incidents of 10 and 11 November 2005 was upheld by the higher prosecutor on 7 February 2007. 46. On 11 February 2008 the Giurgiu District Court upheld the decision of 7 February 2007. The court reached its decision upon examination of the file produced by the prosecution, without administering evidence or hearing witnesses. The court found that the witnesses did not confirm the applicant’s allegations. In particular, those witnesses in Giurgiu Prison who had seen the applicant being hit by agents wearing balaclavas were unable to provide the names of those agents, while other witnesses had no knowledge at all of the said events. The court found the statement by an inmate, S.M., to the effect that one of the two agents wearing balaclavas who had beaten the applicant had been C.C., unconvincing on the ground that the agents’ faces had been covered by the balaclavas. The court further found, with respect to the forensic medical certificate, that “the mere existence of those bruises does not indicate the respondents’ guilt.” 47. On 15 May 2008 Giurgiu County Court upheld the decision of 11 February 2008, finding that the applicant’s allegations had not been fully substantiated. The court reached its decision upon examination of the file produced by the prosecution. It concluded that despite a number of witnesses confirming the occurrence of incidents between the applicant and the prison wardens in Giurgiu Prison, none of those witnesses had identified the applicant’s aggressors as the defendants indicated by the applicant. 48. On 12 December 2005 the Prosecution Office indicted the applicant for assault on a State agent, for having hit C.C. on 10 November 2005. After questioning witnesses to the incident on 10 November 2005 and in the light of the medical certificate issued on 11 November 2005, indicating that C.C. had needed eight to nine days of medical care, the prosecutor established that the applicant had voluntarily hit C.C. on 10 November 2005. 49. Before the Giurgiu District Court the applicant claimed that he had not hit C.C. on 10 November 2005. He contended that while he had been vehemently protesting against the guards’ refusal to take him to the store room, two members of the intervention squad had approached him and hit him. During his attempts to defend himself from the blows, one of the agents might have accidentally been hurt. He claimed, however, that he had not behaved aggressively and had not resisted the immobilisation manoeuvres. He relied on the statements of all the witnesses to the incident, which had shown that he had not acted violently when the agents had attempted to immobilize him. He further stressed that numerous witnesses had stated that the State agents had assaulted him, and pointed to the incoherency of the statements of the agents who claimed that he had voluntarily hit C.C. He finally asked the court to hear evidence from all witnesses to the incident, inmates and State agents. 50. On 22 May 2006 the Giurgiu District Court convicted the applicant of assault on a State agent, C.C., sentenced him to seven years’ imprisonment and, as required by Article 71 of the Criminal Code read in conjunction with Article 64 a) of the Criminal Code, deprived him of his right to vote as an additional penalty. The court firstly noted that the inmates who had witnessed the incident of 10 November 2005 had withdrawn the statements they had made to the prosecutor in which they had indicated that the applicant had hit C.C. Before the court, they had stated that those statements had been made under duress. They submitted to the court that it was the applicant who had been assaulted by the State agents. The court found those statements irrelevant, on the ground that they merely proved an alleged provocation by the State agents, and did not exculpate the applicant from the injuries he had caused to C.C. The court further found that those injuries had been caused with intent, as the statements given by the State agents questioned in the court showed. 51. Following an amendment of the Criminal Code on certain sentences, an appeal by the applicant was allowed on 18 June 2007 by the Giurgiu County Court, with regard to the prison sentence only, which was reduced to one year. The decision was upheld by the Bucharest Court of Appeal on 7 January 2008. 52. On 29 April 2004 the Giurgiu prison administration informed the applicant that his common-law wife, P.N.M., was not allowed to visit him, since the prison records indicated that he was married to another woman. Her name was therefore not put on the list of people allowed to visit the applicant. 53. On 18 March 2005, relying on Government Ordinance no. 56/2003, the applicant challenged the refusal of the Giurgiu Prison administration to allow him visits from P.N.M. with the Giurgiu District Court. By a decision of 31 March 2005 the court found for the applicant and ordered the decision in question to be quashed and the applicant to be entitled to visits from P.N.M. The decision became final. 54. The prison records do not indicate that there were visits from P.N.M. after the judgment of 31 March 2005. They do, however, indicate that he was visited by members of his family on a regular basis. 55. Whether the decision of 31 March 2005 was enforced or not is in dispute between the parties. The applicant claimed that the decision of 31 March 2005 had not been enforced and that P.N.M. had not been put on the list of people allowed to visit him. He did not provide, however, specific information as to any attempts by P.N.M. to visit him after 31 March 2005. In their observations, the Government claimed that, on the contrary, after the decision of 31 March 2005, P.N.M. did not ask to visit the applicant. 56. The domestic legislation on the execution of sentences, in particular Law no. 23/1969 and Emergency Ordinance no. 56/2003 (“Ordinance no. 56/2003”) are described in Petrea v. Romania, no. 4792/03, §§ 21-23, 29 April 2008. On 20 October 2006 Law no. 275/2006 on the execution of sentences entered into force, which replaced Law no. 23/1969 and Ordinance no. 56/2003. Article 38 of Law no. 275/2006 provides the right of a detainee to complain to the delegate judge about any measure taken by the prison administration which infringes the rights granted to him by that Law. The decision taken by the delegate judge is subject to appeal before the District Court. No provision of Law no. 275/2006 deals with the structural quality of the place of detention or the space provided to detainees. 57. The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure concerning complaints about decisions by the prosecutor are set out in Dumitru Popescu v. Romania (no. 1), no. 49234/99, §§ 43-45, 26 April 2007). 58. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code providing the automatic withdrawal of the right to vote and to be elected during the execution of a prison sentence, read as follows: “Disqualification from exercising one or more of the rights mentioned below may be imposed as an additional penalty: (a) the right to vote and to be elected to bodies of a public authority or to public elective office; ...” “The secondary penalty shall consist in disqualification from exercising all the rights listed in Article 64. (2) A life sentence or any other prison sentence shall automatically entail disqualification from exercising the rights referred to in the preceding paragraph from the time at which the conviction becomes final until the end of the term of imprisonment or the granting of a pardon waiving the execution of the sentence ...” 59. In a decision of 5 November 2007 (following an appeal in the interests of the law) which became mandatory on the date of its publication in the Official Gazette on 18 July 2008, the High Court of Cassation and Justice advised the domestic courts to interpret Article 71 § 2 of the Criminal Code in the light of the Convention, and thus assess in each case the necessity of the withdrawal of the right to vote. 60. The Government submitted copies of various decisions given by the domestic courts applying Ordinance no. 56/2003 and Law no. 275/2006. These decisions deal mainly with complaints by detainees which challenged before the national courts various disciplinary measures, or related to the regime of imprisonment, the right to correspondence or medical care. The Government also submitted two cases, one concerning a complaint about poor sanitary installation and lack of observance of a shower schedule, and one concerning a complaint regarding overcrowding, lack of air, and the presence of ill inmates. Both of them were dismissed by the domestic courts on the ground, inter alia, that they “did not regard any of the rights provided by Law no. 275/2006”. 61. Following a visit to Romania by the Commissioner for Human Rights from 13 to 17 September 2004, a report was published on 29 March 2006, providing information on Bucharest-Jilava Prison. The report describes the conditions of detention in this facility as “particularly difficult” and the situation as “alarming”. It further described the facilities as “outdated, windows unable to filter the cold and furniture from another era”. 62. The relevant findings and recommendation of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“the CPT”) are described in the cases Brăgădireanu v. Romania, no. 22088/04, §§ 73-75, 6 December 2007, and Artimenco v. Romania (no. 12535/04, §§ 22-23, 30 June 2009). 63. With regard to Jilava Prison, excerpts from the CPT’s findings following the visits of 1999 and 2006 are given in the case of Eugen Gabriel Radu v. Romania (no. 3036/04, §§ 14-17, 13 October 2009). In particular, the CPT expressed concern about the restricted living space, as the number of detainees exceeded more than twice the prison’s capacity, the shortage of beds, the lack of adequate separation between the toilets and the living space in the cells, and qualified the conditions as “lacking privacy” and “an affront to human dignity”. 64. Following visits in June 2006 to several prisons in Romania, the CPT published a report on 11 December 2008, in which it stated, inter alia: “70. (...) the Committee is gravely concerned that the lack of beds remains an ongoing problem not only in the establishments visited, but also at the national level, and has been since the first visit to Romania in 1995. It is high time that major steps are taken to put an end to this unacceptable situation. The CPT calls upon the Romanian authorities to take decisive priority action to ensure that that each inmate housed in a prison has a bed. However, the Committee welcomes the fact that shortly after the visit in June 2006, the official standard of living space per inmate in the cell was increased from 6 m3 (which amounted to an area of about 2 square metres per detainee) to 4 m2 or 8 m3. The CPT recommends that the Romanian authorities take the necessary steps to meet the standard of 4 m² of living space per inmate in shared cells in all prisons in Romania”. 65. With respect to the practice of prison administrations employing special intervention units, in its report of 2006 the CPT found that special intervention units wearing masks were dispatched to surveillance departments in order to control violent and/or unmanageable and rebellious detainees. According to the CPT, the presence of such units creates an oppressive atmosphere, whereas the wearing of masks makes it difficult to identify a potential suspect if and when an allegation of ill-treatment is made. The CPT recommended that members of the special intervention units should be forbidden from wearing masks in the exercise of their duties in a prison environment, irrespective of the circumstances. The CPT further recommended that the Romanian authorities remind the members of the special intervention units that all forms of ill-treatment against detainees (including verbal provocation and insults) are unacceptable and are to be severely sanctioned, and that the use of force in order to control violent and/or recalcitrant prisoners must be limited to occasions when it is strictly necessary.","['3', 'P1']",['P1-3'],[],[],[],[],1

RUSSIA,4,Violation of Art. 6-1;Remainder inadmissible;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings,Christos Rozakis,"4. The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Yekaterinburg. He suffers from an occupational disease. 5. On 15 May 1997 the applicant sued his former employers, private companies, for compensation for health damage. The Zheleznodorozhniy District Court of Yekaterinburg registered his statement of claim and listed the first preliminary hearing for 9 July 1997. Another preliminary hearing was held on 4 September 1997. 6. Of six hearings listed between 5 February 1998 and 13 June 2000 two hearings were adjourned because the judge was ill or involved in other proceedings and two hearings were postponed for provision of additional evidence and obtaining statements by witnesses. 7. In June 1999 and January 2000 the applicant asked the District Court to order expert medical examinations. The examinations were not ordered because the applicant withdrew his requests. 8. On 13 June 2000 the Zheleznodorozhniy District Court dismissed the applicant's action as unsubstantiated. 9. That judgment was quashed on appeal by the Sverdlovsk Regional Court on 1 August 2000. The case was remitted for a fresh examination to the District Court. 10. It appears that the District Court received the case-file on 3 October 2000 and listed a hearing for 30 November 2000. At that hearing the applicant amended his claims and requested the District Court not to perform a medical examination. 11. Between 16 January and 5 June 2001 the District Court listed three hearings. All of the hearings were adjourned because the judge was ill or involved in other unrelated proceedings. 12. On 5 June 2001 the Zheleznodorozhniy District Court ordered a medical examination of the applicant. The court noted that the defendants should bear the expenses of the examination and stayed the proceedings pending completion. The applicant appealed against that decision, claiming that the examination was not necessary. 13. The Sverdlovsk Regional Court upheld the decision of 5 June 2001 on 7 August 2001. 14. On 9 July 2002 the Zheleznodorozhniy District Court sent the case-file and the applicant's medical records to the Moscow-based Federal expert council on occupational diseases (Федеральный экспертный совет по профзаболеваниям). 15. In November 2002 the council informed the applicant that the examination had not been carried out because it had not been paid for. 16. The examination was performed on 10 April 2003 by the Russian Academy of the medical sciences. The expert report was sent to the District Court on 16 April 2003. A month later the District Court received the case-file. 17. On 23 May 2003 the case was assigned to another judge and a hearing was fixed for 18 June 2003. Between 18 June and 4 August 2003 the District Court fixed two hearings which were adjourned because the defendants defaulted and the judge was ill. 18. On 4 August 2003 the Zheleznodorozhniy District Court dismissed the applicant's claims. 19. That judgment was upheld on 2 October 2003 by the Sverdlovsk Regional Court.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Ingelheim. 7. Since 1979 the applicant has operated a personal security service (Personenschutzunternehmen). 8. On 1 June 1992 he lodged an application for gun licences (waffenrechtliche Erlaubnis) with the county of Querfurt (Saxony-Anhalt), which was granted. Subsequent requests for a renewal of these licences in May and October 1993 were only provisionally granted and were finally dismissed on 23 November 1993. 9. On 30 November 1993 the applicant lodged an administrative appeal (Widerspruch) against the decision of 23 November 1993, which was dismissed on 18 March 1994. 10. The applicant also applied to the Administrative Court for interim measures. This application was dismissed in January 1994, which decision was confirmed on appeal by the Administrative Court of Appeal in August 1994. 11. On 22 April 1994 the applicant brought an action with Halle Administrative Court, initially without detailed reasoning. 12. On 30 June 1994 the statement of defence and the administrative files were submitted to the court. On 7 October 1994 the applicant appointed additional legal counsel, who resigned again in November 1994. 13. In June 1995 Halle Administrative Court ordered the applicant to reason his action within six weeks. After the applicant's lawyer had twice requested an extension of the time-limit set by the court he submitted the reasoning on 19 September 1995. In October 1995 the applicant appointed additional legal counsel. 14. On 5 March 1996 Halle Administrative Court scheduled a hearing for 11 April 1996, which was subsequently rescheduled for 30 May 1996 upon the defendant's request. 15. After the hearing on 30 May 1996 the judgment was delivered and on 4 and 5 July 1996 served on the applicant's counsel. 16. On 22 July 1996 the applicant appealed the judgment. On 5 August 1996 the files were transferred to the Administrative Court of Appeal. On 22 October 1996 the reasoning of the appeal was submitted. On 23 December 1996 and 21 February 1997 answers to the appeal were lodged. 17. On 2 July 1997 the Administrative Court of Appeal informed the applicant's counsel, at his request, that it was not foreseeable when a decision would be rendered. 18. On 10 September 1998 a hearing was scheduled for 18 November 1998. On 10 November 1998, after inspection of the files, the applicant's counsel informed the Administrative Court of Appeal that the files were incomplete. On the same day the court started an enquiry in this respect and informed counsel on 12 November 1998 that its investigations had been to no avail. On 16 November 1998 the applicant's counsel asked for the hearing to be postponed in order for the missing files to be reassembled. On 18 November 1998 the hearing took place; however, the case was adjourned. 19. On 8 December 1999 the Administrative Court of Appeal requested the missing files from the administrative authorities without success. In January and March 2000 the applicant's counsel enquired about the state of the proceedings. On 3 August 2000 the Administrative Court of Appeal requested the files from Halle Administrative Court, without success. On 29 May 2001 the court informed counsel that its efforts to locate the missing files had failed and that a hearing was planned for July 2001. 20. On 12 June 2001 a hearing was scheduled for 12 July 2001. On 9 July 2001 the applicant's counsel asked for the hearing to be postponed because he had not yet been able to reassemble the missing documents. The hearing was subsequently cancelled. 21. On 30 October 2002 new counsel for the applicant requested a hearing and repeated this request on 4 December 2002. On 13 February 2003 counsel again asked for an oral hearing to be scheduled and promised to try to reassemble the missing documents. On 18 March 2003, after counsel had inspected the files in early March, he informed the court that he did not deem the missing documents relevant and requested a hearing. 22. On 29 April 2003 the applicant's former counsel applied for legal aid. On 9 May 2003 the applicant's current counsel filed a motion for bias against the presiding judge because no hearing had been scheduled. On 9 July 2003 he enquired about the state of the proceedings. 23. On 30 July 2003 the court asked for a clarification of the applicant's representation and ordered the applicant's counsel to submit a power of attorney, which he submitted on 5 August 2003. On 19 September 2003 the applicant's counsel again enquired about the state of the proceedings. On 21 October 2003 the court asked whether a hearing could be scheduled for 11 December 2003. The parties agreed. On 3 December 2003 the court informed the parties that because of the motion for bias the hearing could not be held on the date agreed upon. On 8 December 2003 the motion for bias was dismissed. 24. On 5 February 2004 and 17 March 2004 applicant's counsel renewed his request for a hearing. On 31 March 2004 the request for legal aid was dismissed. On 7 April 2004 a hearing was scheduled for 13 May 2004. After the hearing the Administrative Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and refused leave to appeal on points of law. On 30 June 2004 the reasoned judgment was served on the applicant's counsel. 25. On 16 September 2004 the applicant's counsel objected to the refusal to grant leave to appeal on points of law. On 5 January 2005 the Federal Administrative Court dismissed the objection; this was served on the applicant's lawyer on 21 January 2005. 26. On 7 March 2005 the applicant brought a constitutional complaint against, inter alia, the decisions of Halle Administrative Court of 30 May 1996, the Saxony-Anhalt Administrative Court of Appeal of 13 May 2004 and the Federal Administrative Court of 5 January 2005, as well as the decisions of the administrative courts with regard to the interim proceedings. He alleged, inter alia, a violation of his right under Article 6 of the Convention because of the length of the proceedings. At the same time he applied for restitutio in integrum because he had failed to comply with the one-month time-limit for constitutional complaints. 27. On 15 March 2005 the Registry of the Federal Constitutional Court informed the applicant about doubts as to the admissibility of his complaint and asked him to indicate within one month whether he wanted to pursue his complaint. On 14 April 2005 the applicant, who had in the meantime retained new counsel, requested an extension of the time-limit until 16 May 2005. In May 2005 the Registry of the Federal Constitutional Court informed the applicant's counsel that the case would not be registered as a case requiring a judicial decision but would remain in the general register until further submissions had been made. On 12 October 2005 counsel of the applicant submitted observations. On 22 November 2005 the case was registered as a case requiring a decision. 28. In a partial decision of 27 April 2006 the Federal Constitutional Court (file no. 1 BvR 2398/05) dismissed the constitutional complaint as inadmissible in part. The remainder, regarding the length of the proceedings, was forwarded to the Ministry of Justice of Saxony-Anhalt for comments on 11 May 2006. 29. On 30 August 2006 the Ministry of Justice of Saxony-Anhalt submitted its comments. On 25 April 2007 the Federal Constitutional Court refused to admit the remainder of the applicant's constitutional complaint for examination without examining the application for restitutio in integrum. On 7 May 2007 the applicant's lawyer received the Federal Constitutional Court's decision. 30. Section 82 of the Administrative Court Rules (Verwaltungsgerichtsordnung) specifies the requirements that every complaint lodged with the administrative court must comply with, one of which is that the facts and evidence on which the complaint is based should be specified. It further provides that the court shall request the applicant to furnish the necessary information within a determined period of time in the event that the complaint does not meet these requirements. 31. Section 86 (1) of the Administrative Court Rules provides that the court shall investigate the facts of its own motion. Furthermore, it is not bound by the submissions or requests of the parties. 32. Further relevant domestic law, applicable mutatis mutandis to proceedings before the administrative courts, is described in the Court's decision of Sürmeli v. Germany (see Sürmeli v. Germany [GC], no. 75529/01, §§ 62-74, ECHR 2006VII); regarding special complaints alleging inaction the Federal Administrative Court explicitly decided on 30 January 2003 (file no. 3 B 8/03) that the Administrative Court Rules do not provide for such a remedy. 33. The draft bill referred to by the respondent State in the case of Sürmeli (cited above, § 90), tabled in 2005, was abandoned in 2007. On 15 March 2010 the Government introduced a new draft, namely the Act on legal protection in the event of excessive length of judicial proceedings and preliminary proceedings under criminal statutes (Gesetz über Rechtsschutz bei überlangen Gerichtsverfahren und strafrechtlichen Ermittlungsverfahren). Pursuant to this proposed legislation a complaint about a delay in the proceedings must first be lodged in the original proceedings. Where the domestic court subsequently does not provide redress, an action for damages can be brought. 34. The draft bill was forwarded to all affected institutions in April 2010; comments were expected by early June 2010. Afterwards necessary amendments will have to be agreed upon before the Cabinet deals with the draft bill for the first time. The draft bill will then be forwarded for comments to the Bundesrat, the upper house of the German parliament, before being presented to the Bundestag, the lower house. 35. The relevant Council of Europe documents are described in the Court's judgment of Yuriy Nikolayevich Ivanov v. Ukraine (see Yuriy Nikolayevich Ivanov v. Ukraine, no. 40450/04, § 35-37, ECHR 2009...

AUSTRIA,1,Violation of Art. 6-1;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings,Nicolas Bratza,"9. The applicant is serving an eighteen-year prison term following his conviction for murder and burglary in 1987. He was first detained at Karlau Prison, from which he escaped in 1991 but was rearrested within a day. In September 1994 he was transferred to Stein Prison and on 8 May 1995 to Garsten Prison, as the prison administration feared that he and a number of other inmates were devising an escape plan. 10. On 8 May 1995, when prison personnel at Garsten carried out the necessary reception formalities, the applicant refused to cooperate and demanded to be returned to Stein Prison, threatening that otherwise he and other inmates would set fire to Garsten Prison. On the following day, in the course of an interview with a senior prison officer, he again insisted on being returned to Stein Prison and threatened the prison officer that otherwise someone would pay the officer “a private visit”. A few days later he threatened a prison warder saying “that he should not turn his back on him”. On account of these incidents, criminal proceedings on charges of threatening behaviour (gefährliche Drohung) were instituted against the applicant. 11. The Steyr Regional Court (Landesgericht) decided to hold the hearing at Garsten Prison, which is situated about 5 km from Steyr. It set down 29 January 1996 as the date for the trial. The summons indicating the date and place of the hearing was served on the applicant as well as on his official defence counsel a month before the hearing. 12. At the material time information about hearings held at the Steyr Regional Court was given as follows. The public prosecutor's office at the Regional Court issued a hearing list (Verhandlungsspiegel) in the middle of each week for the following week, containing, inter alia, the date and place of all hearings in criminal proceedings. This information would also include the number of the court hearing room and would, if appropriate, indicate that the hearing was to be held at the scene of the crime or the name of the prison at which it was to take place. The Government were unable to provide the list for the week of 29 January 1996, as these lists are not kept, but asserted that it would, in accordance with the usual practice, have indicated Garsten Prison as the place of the hearing in the applicant's case. The hearing list was distributed by the public prosecutor's office to the media, namely to the most important national and regional newspapers, as well as to the national broadcasting station. Furthermore, a copy was given to the Regional Court's registry and information desk. Thus, interested persons could obtain information about forthcoming hearings either by calling the court's registry or by presenting themselves at the court's entrance. 13. On 29 January 1996 the Steyr Regional Court, sitting with a single judge, held a hearing in the closed area (Gesperre) of Garsten Prison. The hearing room measured about 25 sq. m. It was furnished with a table and seats for the judge, the secretary, the public prosecutor, the applicant and his defence counsel. There is disagreement between the parties as to whether there were further seats available for witnesses and potential spectators. 14. The hearing, which according to the minutes was public, was opened at 8.30 a.m. It lasted thirty-five minutes. The applicant, assisted by counsel, pleaded not guilty. The court heard the four prison officers to whom the applicant had allegedly addressed threats as witnesses. Neither the applicant nor his counsel complained about a lack of publicity at that time. Following the hearing, the Regional Court convicted the applicant of threatening behaviour, finding that he had on three occasions threatened prison personnel with arson or assault, and sentenced him to ten months' imprisonment. 15. Thereupon, the applicant filed an appeal on points of law and fact, as well as against sentence (Berufung wegen Nichtigkeit, Schuld und Strafe). He complained, in particular, as a ground of nullity, that the hearing on 29 January 1996 had not been public since it took place in the closed area of Garsten Prison, to which only people with special permits, other than prison personnel, had access. He also claimed that the room in which the hearing was held was too small to accommodate any spectators and alleged that not even the witnesses had been able to stay in the room simultaneously. Moreover, he challenged the Regional Court's assessment of the evidence and its establishment of the facts. Finally, he complained that the sentence was too severe. 16. On 5 July 1996 the Linz Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht) held a public hearing in the court building in the presence of the applicant and his counsel. The appellate court is about 50 km from Garsten Prison. The hearing lasted three-quarters of an hour. The court heard the applicant as regards the alleged lack of publicity of the hearing on 29 January 1996. It also heard him on the various counts of threatening behaviour, questioning him as regards the statements made by the witnesses at the trial. It did not rehear the witnesses and the defence made no request to this effect. 17. The Court of Appeal dismissed the case. As to the complaint that the hearing on 29 January 1996 had not been public, the court noted that, according to information submitted by the Steyr Regional Court, the hearing was public in the sense that any interested person would have been allowed to attend. Had the prison governor been concerned that interested persons should not be granted access to the closed area, he would have been obliged to prohibit the conduct of the trial in that part of the prison. In any case, no such persons wishing to attend the trial had been present at the beginning of the hearing, and the judge had not been informed of any potential spectators. 18. As to the applicant's appeal on points of fact, the Court of Appeal stated that it had no doubts regarding the Regional Court's evaluation of the evidence and its establishment of the facts. The appellate court also confirmed the Regional Court's legal view that the applicant had, by threatening prison personnel with arson or assault, committed the offence of threatening behaviour. Finally, it found that the sentence was commensurate with the applicant's guilt. 19. Article 90 § 1 of the Federal Constitution (Bundesverfassungsgesetz) provides: “Hearings by trial courts in ... criminal cases shall be oral and public. Exceptions may be prescribed by law.” 20. Article 228 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordnung) provides that the trial is to be public. Failure to comply with this requirement constitutes a ground of nullity. According to Article 229 § 1, the public may be excluded from the trial in the interests of morals or public order. The court has to take a formal decision on the exclusion of the public. No remedy lies against such a decision. Pursuant to Article 488, the above provisions apply to proceedings before a single judge. 21. According to Article 489 § 1 taken together with Article 472 § 1, an appeal hearing against a judgment of a single judge has to be public. Articles 228 and 229 apply. 22. According to Article 489 § 1 taken together with Article 464, an appeal on points of law and fact and against sentence lies against the judgment of a single judge. By virtue of Article 467 § 1, the appellant may adduce new facts and evidence. In accordance with Article 473 § 2, the appellate court will rehear witnesses and experts if it has doubts as to the correctness of the first-instance court's establishment of the facts, or if it holds that the hearing of new witnesses or experts as regards the same facts is necessary. Otherwise, it will take its decision on the basis of the file.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

UKRAINE,3,Remainder inadmissible;Violation of Art. 3 (in case of extradition to Kazakhstan);Violation of Art. 13,Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Mykhaylo Buromenskiy;Peer Lorenzen;Renate Jaeger;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"6. The applicants were born in 1962, 1960, 1971 and 1963 respectively and currently live in Kyiv. 7. At the end of 2002 the applicants left Kazakhstan, allegedly because of political persecution by the authorities. They arrived in Ukraine in 2005 and have remained there. 8. By four separate decisions of 28 March 2006, the Ukrainian State Committee on Nationalities and Migration granted the applicants’ requests for refugee status, finding that there were legitimate grounds to fear that the applicants would risk political persecution in Kazakhstan for their activities in 2001-02. In particular, the Committee noted that in November 2001 several top political and business figures in Kazakhstan had formed the opposition group Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan. The applicants took part in the activities of that group, mainly by providing it with financial and technical support, particularly through a television company owned by the first and second applicants. The fourth applicant held posts in the governing body (political council) of that group. Shortly afterwards, the Kazakh authorities arrested the leaders of the group. The authorities also instituted criminal proceedings against the applicants on various charges, including conspiracy to murder, abuse of power and fraud, annulled the broadcasting licence of their television company, and blocked the activities of their other companies. As pressure from the authorities mounted, the applicants fled the country. 9. By four separate requests issued in September 2007 and April and May 2008, the Office of the General Prosecutor of the Republic of Kazakhstan requested the applicants’ extradition with a view to criminal prosecution for organised crime and conspiracy to murder (first applicant, Articles 28, 96 and 237 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan), tax evasion and money laundering (second and third applicants, Articles 193 and 222 of the Criminal Code) and abuse of power (fourth applicant, Articles 307 and 308 of the Criminal Code). Pursuant to Article 96 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan, murder was punishable by deprivation of liberty for a term of from ten to twenty years or by the death penalty, or by life imprisonment with or without confiscation of property. As regards other crimes of which the applicants were accused, the relevant provision of the Criminal Code provided for punishment not exceeding ten years’ imprisonment. The Kazakh prosecutors provided assurances that the criminal prosecution of the applicants was not related to their political views, race, nationality or religion, and that the prosecutors would not request the domestic courts to sentence the first applicant to death for the crimes for which he was wanted. 10. On 19 and 21 May 2008 the Deputy Prosecutor General lodged objections (protests) with the State Committee on Nationalities and Religion (the former State Committee on Nationalities and Migration) seeking reconsideration and subsequent annulment of its decisions of 28 March 2006. She submitted that the applicants were wanted by the Kazakh authorities on charges of “grave” crimes and that the Office of the General Prosecutor of the Republic of Kazakhstan guaranteed that the criminal prosecution of the applicants was not related to their political views, race, nationality or religion. 11. On 30 May 2008 the Committee rejected the objections and confirmed its previous findings. 12. On 17 June 2008 the Deputy General Prosecutor lodged two separate administrative claims with the District Administrative Court of Kyiv seeking annulment of the Committee’s decisions of 28 March 2006. The prosecutor also requested the court to suspend the contested decisions. On 4 July 2008 the court opened the proceedings and informed that it would decide on the prosecutor’s request for suspension of the Committee’s decisions at one of its next hearings. 13. On 24 November 2008 the court dismissed the prosecutor’s claims. On 22 January 2009 the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal upheld the first-instance court’s decision. No copies of the decisions were provided by the parties. 14. On 11 February 2009 the Office of the General Prosecutor of Ukraine lodged an appeal in cassation with the Higher Administrative Court, the outcome of which is unknown. 15. By a letter of 25 May 2009, the First Deputy General Prosecutor of the Republic of Kazakhstan sent the Deputy General Prosecutor of Ukraine assurances that in accordance with the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment of 1984, if extradited to Kazakhstan the applicants would not be subjected to illtreatment, that they would receive a fair trial, and that if necessary they would be provided with adequate medical aid and treatment. 16. The Government submitted that they had received assurances from the Office of the General Prosecutor of Ukraine that no decision on the applicants’ extradition would be taken before the Court had considered the case. 17. The relevant extracts from the Constitution provide as follows: “Foreigners and stateless persons who are lawfully in Ukraine enjoy the same rights and freedoms and also bear the same duties as citizens of Ukraine, with the exceptions established by the Constitution, laws or international treaties to which Ukraine is a party. Foreigners and stateless persons may be granted asylum under the procedure established by law.” “Human and citizens’ rights and freedoms are protected by the courts. Everyone is guaranteed the right to challenge in court the decisions, actions or omission of bodies exercising State power, local self-government bodies, officials and officers. ...After exhausting all domestic legal remedies, everyone has the right of appeal for the protection of his or her rights and freedoms to the relevant international judicial institutions or to the relevant bodies of international organisations of which Ukraine is a member or participant. Everyone has the right to protect his or her rights and freedoms from violations and illegal encroachments by any means not prohibited by law.” “The following are determined exclusively by the laws of Ukraine: (1) human and citizens’ rights and freedoms, the guarantees of these rights and freedoms; the main duties of the citizen; ... (14) the judicial system, judicial proceedings, the status of judges, the principles of judicial expertise, the organisation and operation of the prosecution service, the bodies of inquiry and investigation, the notary, the bodies and institutions for the execution of punishments; the fundamentals of the organisation and activity of the advocacy; ...” 18. Ukraine joined the Convention on 10 January 2002. The relevant extracts from the Convention provide as follows: “For the purposes of the present Convention, the term “refugee” shall apply to any person who ... owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable, or owing to such fear is unwilling, to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or owing to such fear, is unwilling, to return to it.” “1. The Contracting States shall not expel a refugee who is lawfully in their territory save on grounds of national security or public order. 2. The expulsion of such a refugee shall be only in pursuance of a decision reached in accordance with due process of law...” Article 33 “1. No Contracting State shall expel or return (refouler) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. 2. The benefit of the present provision may not, however, be claimed by a refugee whom there are reasonable grounds for regarding as a danger to the security of the country in which he is, or who, having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community of that country.” 19. The Convention entered into force in respect of Ukraine on 9 June 1998. Its relevant provisions read as follows: “The Contracting Parties undertake to surrender to each other, subject to the provisions and conditions laid down in this Convention, all persons against whom the competent authorities of the requesting Party are proceeding for an offence or who are wanted by the said authorities for the carrying out of a sentence or detention order.” “Extradition shall not be granted if the offence in respect of which it is requested is regarded by the requested Party as a political offence or as an offence connected with a political offence. The same rule shall apply if the requested Party has substantial grounds for believing that a request for extradition for an ordinary criminal offence has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion, or that that person’s position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons. The taking or attempted taking of the life of a Head of State or a member of his family shall not be deemed to be a political offence for the purposes of this Convention. This article shall not affect any obligations which the Contracting Parties may have undertaken or may undertake under any other international convention of a multilateral character.” 20. Ukraine’s reservation in respect of Article 1 of the Convention contained in the instrument of ratification deposited on 11 March 1998 reads as follows: “Ukraine reserves the right to refuse extradition if the person whose extradition is requested cannot, on account of his/her state of health, be extradited without damage to his/her health.” 21. The Convention was ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament on 10 November 1994. It entered into force in respect of Ukraine on 14 April 1995 and in respect of Kazakhstan on 19 May 1994. The relevant extracts from the Convention provide as follows: “1. The Contracting Parties shall ... on each other’s request extradite persons who ﬁnd themselves on their territory, for criminal prosecution or to serve a sentence. 2. Extradition for criminal prosecution shall extend to offences which are criminally punishable under the laws of the requesting and requested Contracting Parties, and which entail at least one year’s imprisonment or a heavier sentence...” “1. No extradition shall take place if: a) the person whose extradition is sought is a citizen of the requested Contracting Party; b) at the moment of receipt of the request [for extradition] criminal prosecution may not be initiated or a sentence may not be executed as time-barred or for other reasons envisaged by the legislation of the requested Contracting Party; c) concerning the same crime there has been a judgment or a decision which has entered into the force of law discontinuing the proceedings against the person whose extradition is sought, on the territory of the requested Contracting Party; d) the legislation of the requesting and requested Contracting Parties envisages that criminal prosecution for [the crimes of which the person is accused] may be initiated [only upon a victim’s complaint]. 2. Extradition may be refused if the crime in connection with which it is sought, was committed on the territory of the requested Contracting Party. 3. In the event of refusal to extradite the requesting Contracting Party shall be informed of the reasons for the refusal.” “1. A request for extradition shall include the following information: (a) the title of the requesting and requested authorities; (b) a description of the factual circumstances of the offence, the text of the law of the requesting Contracting Party which criminalises the offence, and the punishment sanctioned by that law; (c) the [name] of the person to be extradited, the year of birth, citizenship, place of residence, and, if possible, a description of his appearance, his photograph, ﬁngerprints and other personal information; (d) information concerning the damage caused by the offence. 2. A request for extradition for the purpose of criminal prosecution shall be accompanied by a certiﬁed copy of a detention order...” “1. If a request for extradition does not contain all the necessary data, the requested Contracting Party may ask for additional information, for the submission of which it shall set a time-limit not exceeding one month. This time-limit may be extended for up to a month at the request of the requesting Contracting Party...” 22. Article 2 of the Code provides that the task of the administrative judiciary is the protection of the rights, freedoms and interests of individuals and the rights and interests of legal entities in the sphere of public law relations from violations by State bodies, bodies of local self-government, their officials and other persons in the exercise of their powers. Under the second paragraph of this Article, any decisions, actions or omissions of the authorities may be challenged before the administrative courts. 23. Pursuant to Article 117, an administrative court may suspend a disputed decision by way of application of an interim measure, on a party’s own initiative. This measure may be applied if there exists a real danger of harm to the plaintiff’s rights, freedoms and interests, or if there are grounds to believe that the failure to apply the measure would render impossible the protection of such rights, freedoms and interests or would require considerable efforts and expense for their restoration. It can also be applied if it is evident that the contested decision is unlawful. 24. The relevant provisions of the Prosecution Service Act provide as follows: “An objection to [the decision] shall be lodged by a prosecutor or his deputy with the body which issued [that decision] or with a higher authority... In [his] objection a prosecutor raises a question of annulment of [the disputed decision] or of bringing it into compliance with the law... An objection by a prosecutor suspends [the decision] in respect of which it was introduced and must be examined by the relevant authority ... within ten days... In case the protest was rejected or was not examined, a prosecutor may challenge [the decision] before a court ... [w]ithin fifteen days... The introduction of such a complaint [by a prosecutor] suspends ... [the decision].” 25. The relevant extracts from the Refugees Act provide as follows: “...a refugee is a person who is not a citizen of Ukraine and who, due to wellfounded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable to avail himself of the protection of that country or, due to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of such protection, or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former permanent residence, is unable or unwilling to return to it because of the said fear...” “Matters relating to refugees are regulated by the Constitution of Ukraine, this law, and other normative acts, as well as by international treaties which have been agreed by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. If an international treaty which has been agreed to be binding by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine provides for rules other than those envisaged in this law, the rules of the international treaty shall apply.” “No refugee may be expelled or forcibly returned to a country where his life or freedom is endangered for reasons of race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. No refugee may be expelled or forcibly returned to a country where he may suffer torture and other severe, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, or [to a country] from which he may be expelled or forcibly returned to a country where his life or freedom is endangered for reasons of race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. This article shall not apply to a refugee convicted of a serious crime in Ukraine.” 26. The relevant extracts from the resolution read as follows: “... 2. Having regard to the fact that the current legislation does not allow the courts independently to give permission for extradition of persons and that, pursuant to Article 22 of the European Convention on Extradition and similar provisions of other international treaties to which Ukraine is a party, the extradition procedure is regulated solely by the law of the requested State; the courts are not empowered to decide on this issue. They [the courts] cannot on their own initiative decide on preventive measures applicable to persons subject to rendition or transfer, including their detention, as these matters are to be decided by the competent Ukrainian authorities...” 27. The relevant extracts from the resolution read as follows: “... 2. ...The administrative courts enjoy jurisdiction over all disputes concerning claims by a foreigner or a stateless person challenging decisions, actions or inactivity of the authorities carrying out extradition ... except for cases concerning the authorities’ requests for arrest or detention with a view to extradition ... which fall to be considered in the framework of criminal proceedings... 16. Before deciding on an administrative case, the court ... may apply the measures envisaged by Article 117 of the Code of Administrative Justice... In particular, [the measures may be applied] if there exists a danger of harm to the interests of a foreigner or a stateless person, or if failure to apply the measures would render difficult or impossible the protection of a person’s rights... Given the provisions of part 4 of section 21 of the Prosecution Services Act ... the courts should take into account that the introduction of a claim by the prosecutor under the procedure envisaged by this provision has a suspensive effect on the contested decision. Therefore, in such a case there is no need to decide on the application of the [interim] measures... 23. ...In the course of consideration of a case in which a decision granting refugee status ... is being challenged, the court may find such a decision unlawful, annul it and order the respondent [authority] to re-examine a request for refugee status with due regard to the circumstances on the basis of which the court annulled the decision. With the annulment of the decision granting refugee status the person [concerned] may not be forcibly removed or extradited before the procedure concerning [the request for] refugee status is completed... 28. ...In the course of the consideration of a dispute in which a foreigner or a stateless person challenges a decision, actions or inactivity of the authorities carrying out extradition ... the courts should take into account that the prohibition of removal of a person under international law on human rights and protection of refugees’ rights takes precedence over any obligation to extradite... If an extradition is requested by the State of origin of a refugee, the courts should take into account that according to Article 33 (1) of the [United Nations] Convention [Relating to the Status of Refugees] of 1951 no extradition of such a person shall be carried out. In such cases the principle of non-refoulement ... provides for a complete prohibition of extradition, if it has not been established that [a refugee’s personal situation] provided for one of the exceptions [to this rule]...” 28. The relevant provisions of the instruction read as follows: “1. General provisions ... The procedure ... established by the Instruction ... is aimed at [introducing] uniform approaches to [dealing with] ... foreign States’ extradition requests [and] ensuring appropriate consideration and preparation of necessary documents, securing of rights and lawful interests of persons whose extradition is requested... 3. Procedure of consideration of foreign States’ requests 3.1. Upon receipt of information concerning an arrest on the territory of Ukraine of a person wanted for crimes committed in other countries [the prosecutor responsible for the consideration of a particular request] shall immediately, and at least within three days, prepare a relevant notification of the competent body of the foreign State, in which he should ask for confirmation of the [latter’s] intention to submit a request for removal of the person. In this context, [the prosecutor] must establish the qualification of the unlawful acts, for which extradition ... will be requested, and check whether the criminal proceedings are time-barred in accordance with the legislation of Ukraine. At the same time, for the purposes of securing the rights of the arrested person ... the relevant prosecutors’ offices shall be given instructions to carry out a thorough examination of the lawfulness of the person’s arrest and to check if there are any circumstances capable of preventing the arrested person’s removal... If in the course of an inquiry it is established that the arrested person is a Ukrainian national or a stateless person permanently residing on the territory of Ukraine or that there are other circumstances which according to the law render the person’s extradition impossible, [the prosecutor] shall immediately submit to the Deputy Prosecutor General ... a proposal for the person’s release or for remanding the person in custody and initiating criminal proceedings in Ukraine. The foreign authority shall be informed of such circumstances and, if there are [relevant] grounds, it shall be invited to consider the possibility of transferring the criminal [case to Ukraine]... 3.3. Upon [submission by] the regional prosecutors’ offices of materials of the inquiry and information concerning any obstacles to extradition ... the prosecutor [dealing with an extradition request] shall study all the documents concerning the matter, being mindful of the need to establish certain circumstances, in particular whether: - it has been established ... which language the wanted person speaks... - in the [written] explanations of the offender the date and purpose of his arrival in Ukraine, his place of residence and registration, his nationality, any requests for asylum or refugee status, his state of health, notification of the reasons of his arrest in Ukraine are mentioned; - the lawfulness of his arrest ... has been ensured... - information has been received on the arrested person’s ability to remain in detention ... - it has been thoroughly checked if if the arrested person is a Ukrainian national, actually residing on a permanent basis in Ukraine ... [and if there are] other circumstances which could constitute an obstacle to removing the person; - a reasoned opinion concerning the matter has been received from the State body [responsible for nationality matters]. Having examined [the documents] the prosecutor ... has prepared a reasoned opinion concerning the decision to be taken by the Office of the General Prosecutor concerning the extradition request... 3.4. The offender ... shall be notified of the decision taken by the Office of the General Prosecutor concerning the extradition request. 3.5. If a decision to extradite is taken ... instructions concerning the organisation of the person’s transfer abroad shall be prepared... 3.7. If the person or his lawyer has lodged with the court a complaint challenging the actions of the Office of the General Prosecutor ... or its decision [to extradite], [the prosecutor] shall make available, at the court’s request, materials confirming the lawfulness and reasonableness of the decision...” 29. At its forty-first session (3-21 November 2008) the CAT considered its second periodic report on Kazakhstan. The relevant extracts from its concluding observations provide as follows: “6. While the Committee acknowledges the efforts made by the State party to enact new legislation incorporating the definition of torture of the Convention [against Torture] into domestic law, it remains concerned that the definition in the new article 347-1 of the Criminal Code [of the Republic of Kazakhstan] does not contain all the elements of Article 1 of the Convention, restricts the prohibition of torture to acts by “public officials” and does not cover acts by “other persons acting in an official capacity”, including those acts that result from instigation, consent or acquiescence on the part of a public official. The Committee notes further with concern that the definition of Article 347-1 of the Criminal Code excludes physical and mental suffering caused as a result of “legitimate acts” on the part of officials... 7. The Committee is concerned about consistent allegations concerning the frequent use of torture and ill-treatment, including threat of sexual abuse and rape, committed by law enforcement officers, often to extract “voluntary confessions” or information to be used as evidence in criminal proceedings, so as to meet the success criterion determined by the number of crimes solved... 8. The Committee is particularly concerned about allegations of torture or other illtreatment in temporary detention isolation facilities (IVSs) and in investigation isolation facilities (SIZOs) under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs or National Security Committee (NSC), especially in the context of national and regional security and anti-terrorism operations conducted by the NSC. The Committee notes with particular concern reports that the NSC has used counter-terrorism operations to target vulnerable groups or groups perceived as a threat to national and regional security, such as asylum seekers and members or suspected members of banned Islamic groups or Islamist parties... 9. The Committee is deeply concerned at allegations that torture and ill-treatment of suspects commonly takes place during the period between apprehension and the formal registration of detainees at the police station, thus providing them with insufficient legal safeguards. The Committee notes in particular: (a) the failure to acknowledge and record the actual time of the arrest of a detainee, as well as unrecorded periods of pre-trial detention and investigation; (b) Restricted access to lawyers and independent doctors and failure to notify detainees fully of their rights at the time of apprehension; (c) The failure to introduce, through the legal reform of July 2008, habeas corpus procedure in full conformity with international standards... 10. The Committee expresses concern that the right of an arrested person to notify relatives of his/her whereabouts may be postponed for seventy-two hours from the time of detention, in the case of so-called “exceptional circumstances”... 11. The Committee notes with concern the Government’s acknowledgement of frequent violations of the Code of Criminal Procedure by State party officials as regards the conduct of an interview within a twenty-four-hour period, detention prior to the institution of criminal proceedings, notification of relatives of the suspect or accused person of that person’s detention within twenty-four hours, and the right to counsel. The Committee is also concerned that most of the rules and instructions of the Ministry of Interior, the Prosecutor’s Office and especially the National Security Committee are classified as “for internal use only” and are not in the realm of public documents. These rules leave many issues to the discretion of the officials, which results in claims that, in practice, detainees are not always afforded the rights of access to fundamental safeguards... 13. The Committee is concerned that Article 14 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for forced placement of suspects and defendants at the stage of pre-trial investigation in medical institutions in order to conduct a forensic psychiatric expert evaluation. The Committee notes with further concern that the grounds for making such a decision are subjective and that the law fails to regulate the maximum duration of forced placement into a medical institution, as well as to guarantee the right to be informed of and to challenge methods of medical treatment or intervention... 17. The Committee expresses concern that sentences of those convicted under Part 1 of article 347-1 of the Criminal Code are not commensurate with the gravity of the offence of torture as required by the Convention... 18. The Committee is also concerned that despite the criminalisation of torture in 2002 in a separate article of the Criminal Code, it appears that when prosecuted, law enforcement officials continue to be charged under Articles 308 or 347 of the Criminal Code (“Excess of authority or official power” or “Coercion into making a confession” respectively)... 21. The Committee welcomes the successful reform of much of the Kazakh penitentiary system through the adoption of programmes conducted in close cooperation with international and national organisations, as well as the enactment of new laws and regulations. It further notes that this reform resulted in a decrease in the rate of pre-trial detention, an increased use of alternative sanctions to imprisonment, more humane conditions of detention, and a marked improvement in the conditions of detention in post-conviction detention facilities. However, the Committee remains concerned at: (a) The deterioration of prison conditions and stagnation in the implementation of penal reforms since 2006; (b) Persistent reports of abuse in custody; (c) Poor conditions of detention and persistent overcrowding in detention facilities; (d) Excessive use of isolation with regards to pre-trial detainees and prisoners and lack of regulation of the frequency of such isolation; (e) Instances of group self-mutilation by prisoners reportedly as a form of protest for ill-treatments; (f) Lack of access to independent medical personnel in pre-trial detention centres and reported failure to register signs of torture and ill-treatment or to accept detainee’s claims of torture and ill-treatment as the basis for an independent medical examination; (g) Persistent high incidence of death in custody, in particular in pre-trial detention (such as the case of the former KNB General Zhomart Mazhrenov), some of which are alleged to have followed torture or ill-treatment... 22. While welcoming the creation in 2004 of the Central Public Monitoring Commission and in 2005 of regional independent public monitoring commissions with the power to inspect detention facilities, the Committee remains concerned that their access to IVSs is neither automatic nor guaranteed and that their access to medical institutions has yet to be considered. Furthermore, it has been reported that the commissions have not been granted the right to make unannounced visits to detention facilities, that they are not always given unimpeded and private access to detainees and prisoners, and that some inmates have been subjected to ill-treatment after having reported to the commissions’ members... 23. The Committee welcomes the creation of the Human Rights Commissioner (Ombudsman) in 2002 with a broad mandate and notably the competence to consider communications of human rights violations and to conduct visits of places of deprivation of liberty. The Committee notes however with concern that the ombudsman’s competencies are substantially limited and that it lacks independence due to the fact that it does not have its own budget. The Committee notes with further concern that the mandate of the Human Rights Commissioner does not empower it to investigate action taken by the Prosecutor’s office... 24. The Committee notes with concern that the preliminary examinations of reports and complaints of torture and ill-treatment by police officers are undertaken by the Department of Internal Security, which is under the same chain of command as the regular police force, and consequently do not lead to prompt and impartial examinations. The Committee notes with further concern that the lengthy period for preliminary examination of torture complaints, which can last up to two months, may prevent timely documentation of evidence... 25. While noting with satisfaction the introduction of many fundamental legislative amendments, the Committee remains concerned about allegations, as reported by the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers in 2005 (see E/CN.4/2005/60/Add.2), of a lack of independence of judges since the designation of oblast and rayon judges rests entirely with the President... 26. While welcoming the adoption of a recent legal amendment transferring the power of issuing arrest warrants to courts solely, the Committee expresses concern, however, at the preeminent role performed by the Procuracy. The Committee reiterates the concerns expressed in its previous concluding observations (A/56/44, para. 128(c)) regarding the insufficient level of independence and effectiveness of the Procurator, in particular due to its dual responsibility for prosecution and oversight of proper conduct of investigations and failure to initiate and conduct prompt, impartial and effective investigations into allegations of torture and ill-treatment... 27. The Committee notes with concern the report by the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers that defence lawyers lack adequate legal training and have very limited powers to collect evidence, which conspires to hamper their capacity to counterbalance the powers of the Prosecutor and impact on the judicial process. The Committee notes with further concern allegations that the procedure of appointing a lawyer lacks transparency and independence... 28. While welcoming the information provided by the delegation that victims of torture have the opportunity to be compensated, the Committee is concerned, nevertheless, at the lack of examples of cases in which the individual received such compensation, including medical or psychosocial rehabilitation... 29. While welcoming the assurance given by the delegation that judges reject such evidence in court proceedings, the Committee notes however with grave concern reports that judges often ignore the complaints of torture and ill-treatment, do not order independent medical investigations, and often proceed with the trials, therefore not respecting the principle of non-admissibility of such evidence in every instance...” 30. In its 2004 report “Political Freedoms in Kazakhstan”, Human Rights Watch made the following observations: “...On November 18, 2001, the day after Abliazov lost his bid for control of Halyk Savings Bank, he and Zhakianov founded Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan (DVK). The new organisation’s platform included broadening the parliament’s powers, establishing direct elections of regional political leaders, instituting electoral and judicial reform, and expanding media freedoms. As of the end of 2003, it reportedly had about 32,000 members. The central government’s response to the establishment of DVK was to immediately dismiss its members who held government posts and to prosecute others. On November 20, just two days after DVK’s formation was announced, Zhakianov was abruptly dismissed from his post as governor of Pavlodar. Other DVK founding members and principals who were also senior government officials – including a deputy prime minister, the deputy minister of defence, the minister of labour, and a deputy finance minister – were also dismissed. Zhakianov’s four deputies from the Pavlodar governor’s office were immediately fired, and almost twenty other Pavlodar provincial and local government members perceived as DVK supporters were alleged to have submitted ""voluntary"" resignations in the wake of the DVK’s founding. In late December 2001, state authorities brought charges of abuse of position against two of Zhakianov’s Pavlodar administration deputies, Sergei Gorbenko and Aleksandr Riumkin. A few days later, on January 4, 2002, the same charges were brought against Zhakianov. Confrontation between the DVK and the Nazarbaev government was heated during the early days after its founding. On January 19-20, 2002, the DVK joined forces with other opposition groups and led large-scale meetings in Almaty, attracting about 1,000 participants. At the meeting, Zhakianov and other prominent political figures delivered speeches that criticized the Nazarbaev government, and Zhakianov called for a referendum on the direct election of regional political leaders. President Nazarbaev countered on January 25 with a speech criticising the meeting, and demanded that law enforcement agencies take steps to stop ""the buffoonery"". The government also moved to restrict information about the DVK and its calls for reform. Television stations that had covered DVK activities, including the Almatybased Tan and Pavlodar-based Irbis were abruptly taken off the air. Publishing houses came under pressure from the government, and as a result refused to print DVK material. Committee for National Security (KNB) and other security officials interrogated meeting participants in at least five provinces. In the days that followed the Almaty gathering, criminal charges of abuse of position and financial mismanagement were brought against Mukhtar Abliazov. Then, on March 27 2002, following publication of materials on “Kazakhgate” in Abliazov-controlled media, Abliazov himself was arrested. Five months later, both Abliazov and Zhakianov were convicted on charges of abuse of office and sentenced to six and seven-year prison terms respectively, during trials that international observers called grossly flawed...” 31. Several Amnesty International reports dating back to 2002 referred to politically motivated prosecutions of persons who openly disagreed with and criticised the Kazakh authorities. In particular, in its report ‘Concerns in Europe and Central Asia: January - June 2002’, published on 1 September 2002, Amnesty International observed that: “...[In Kazakhstan] [i]n the period under review, criminal cases were opened on charges of “abuse of office” and financial crimes against two well-known leaders of the opposition party Democratic Choice for Kazakstan (DCK), Mukhtar Ablyazov - the former Minister of Energy, Industry and Trade - and Galymzhan Zhakiyanov - the former Governor of the Northern Pavlodar region. There were reports that the charges were brought to punish them for their peaceful opposition activities. Mukhtar Ablyazov was detained on 27 March [2002], and on 28 March [2002] a criminal case was reportedly opened against Galymzhan Zhakiyanov. Galymzhan Zhakiyanov subsequently sought refuge in the French embassy in Almaty from 29 March to 3 April [2002]. He reportedly agreed to leave the embassy and be placed under house arrest on condition that he had free access to lawyers and that embassy representatives of European Union states could visit him freely. On 10 April [2002] police transferred him to the town of Pavlodar, where he was also kept under house arrest.” 32. Its next report “Concerns in Europe and Central Asia: July - December 2002”, published on 1 July 2003, contained the following observations: “...Mukhtar Ablyazov and Galymzhan Zhakiyanov, two former senior government officials and well-known leaders of the opposition Democratic Choice for Kazakstan movement, were sentenced to six and seven years’ imprisonment respectively, on charges of “abuse of office” and financial crimes, including misappropriation of state funds. Mukhtar Ablyazov was convicted on 18 July [2002] by the Supreme Court of Kazakstan and Galymzhan Zhakiyanov was convicted on 2 August [2002] by Pavlograd city court... Reportedly, the trials of both men did not conform to international fair trial standards. There were allegations of limited access to both men by lawyers and family members before and after the trial... Despite a sharp deterioration in Galymzhan Zhakiyanov’s health as a result of interrogations in May and June [2002], the investigator had reportedly insisted on continuing interrogating him... Mukhtar Ablyazov and Galymzhan Zhakiyanov were apparently targeted because of their peaceful opposition activities... Forty-nine-year old Sergey Duvanov – independent journalist and editor of a human rights bulletin – was arrested by police on 28 October [2002], accused of having raped a minor. The trial against him opened on 24 December [2002] in Karasay district court in Almaty region. There were allegations that the rape charge was brought to discredit him and that the case was politically motivated. Reportedly, Sergey Duvanov had been targeted before to punish him for his independent journalism. He had been interrogated by the security service in Almaty on 9 July [2002] and subsequently charged with “insulting the honour and dignity of the President” (Article 318 of the Criminal Code of Kazakhstan), reportedly in connection with an article implicating governmental officials in financial crimes; on 28 August [2002] he was assaulted by three unidentified men in plainclothes and had to be hospitalised...” 33. In November 2008 Amnesty International submitted its briefing ‘Kazakhstan: Summary of Concerns on Torture and Ill-treatment’ to the CAT to complement the information concerning the human rights situation in Kazakhstan provided by various domestic and international NGOs with the aim of assisting the CAT in the examination of the Kazakhstan’s second periodic report under Article 19 of the Convention against Torture (see above). This briefing covered the period 2002-08 with more emphasis on recent years, and focused on Amnesty International’s “most pressing concerns about the failures of the authorities in Kazakhstan to implement fully and effectively Articles 2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 16 of the Convention against Torture”. The relevant extracts from the briefing read as follows: “...Amnesty International has ... received allegations in some high-profile criminal cases linked to the prosecution and conviction in absentia of the former son-in-law of President Nazarbaev, Rakhat Aliev, for planning an alleged coup attempt and several other charges, that associates or employees of Rakhat Aliev were arbitrarily detained by NSS officers, held incommunicado in pre-charge and pre-trial detention facilities where they were tortured or otherwise ill-treated with the aim of extracting “confessions” that they had participated in the alleged coup plot. In at least one case, relatives have alleged that the trial was secret and that the accused did not have access to adequate defense...” 34. The same document also contained more general observations relating to the issue of torture and ill-treatment in Kazakhstan: “...Amnesty International remains concerned that despite efforts by the authorities of Kazakhstan to fulfill their obligations under the CAT and implement recommendations made by the Committee in 2001 torture and other ill-treatment remain widespread and such acts continue to be committed with virtual impunity... According to reports received by Amnesty International from domestic and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and inter-governmental organizations (IGOs), lawyers, diplomats, citizens and foreign nationals, beatings by law enforcement officers, especially in temporary pre-charge detention centers, in the streets or during transfer to detention centers, are still routine. From interviews Amnesty International conducted in 2006 and 2008 with concerned organizations and individuals it has emerged that torture or other ill-treatment in detention continues to be widespread, despite the safeguards against torture or other ill-treatment which the authorities have introduced and the education, reform and training programs for law enforcement forces and the judiciary often run in conjunction and in cooperation with NGOs and IGOs. While, by all accounts, Kazakhstan had implemented a successful reform of its penitentiary system - starting with the transfer of the prison system to the Ministry of Justice in late 2001 - with significant improvements in the conditions of detention in post-conviction detention centers, the last two years have reportedly seen a decline in prison conditions, and many of the abusive practices reoccurring more and more often. Comparatively few law enforcement officers – even according to official figures – have been brought to trial and held accountable for violations they have committed, including torture, and yet scores of people throughout the country routinely allege that they have been arbitrarily detained and tortured or ill-treated in custody in order to extract a “confession”. Evidence based on such “confessions” is still routinely admitted in court. Corruption in law enforcement and the judiciary is believed to contribute largely to a climate of impunity. This climate of impunity leads to a lack of public confidence in the criminal justice system. It was reported to Amnesty International that people only rarely lodge complaints as they feel that they will not obtain justice, nor get compensation. Many are not willing to testify against law enforcement officers out of fear of reprisals against themselves or their relatives and associates...” 35. As regards the application of the death penalty in Kazakhstan, Amnesty International made the following observations: “...In May 2007 the scope of the application of the death penalty permitted by the constitution was reduced from 10 ""exceptionally grave"" crimes to one – that of terrorism leading to loss of life. The death penalty also remains a possible punishment for ""exceptionally grave"" crimes committed during times of war. A person sentenced to death in Kazakhstan retains the right to petition for clemency. A moratorium on executions, which had been imposed in 2003, remained in force and no death sentences were passed during 2007 and the first 10 months of 2008. All 31 prisoners on death row had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment...”","['13', '3']",[],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1965. He lives in Sagopshi, in the Malgobek district of Ingushetia. 6. The applicant is the brother of Suleyman Tsechoyev, born in 1956. 7. At the material time the applicant studied law in Yekaterinburg, Russia. The applicant was not an eyewitness to his brother's arrest and the following account is based on the witness statements collected by him later. 8. On the night of 23 October 1998 the applicant's brother Suleyman Tsechoyev was arrested in the family house situated at 40, Shosseynaya Street, in the settlement of Sagopshi in the Malgobek district of Ingushetia. The arrest was apparently carried out by the officers of the North Caucasus Regional Department for the Fight against Organised Crime (Северокавказское Региональное Управление по Борьбе с Организованной Преступностью – “the RUBOP”). The applicant submitted that at the time of the arrest the officers did not introduce themselves and did not present any documents or justification for their action. Nor did they inform the family where they were taking Mr Tsechoyev. 9. On 28 October 1998 the applicant, alerted by his mother, arrived at Sagopshi. His relatives told him that there had been no news of Suleyman Tsechoyev's whereabouts. 10. According to the documents submitted by the Government, on 3 November 1998 Suleyman Tsechoyev had been charged with aiding and abetting the kidnapping of Magomed K. on 5 September 1998, together with two other men and unidentified persons from Chechnya. The kidnapped man had been taken to Chechnya in two VAZ cars. 11. On 6 November 1998 the applicant, together with his sister, met with Mr Magomed Ye., the deputy prosecutor of Malgobek. The latter informed them that their brother had been arrested on his orders by officers of the RUBOP and was being detained in the town of Nazran, Ingushetia. Mr Magomed Ye. refused to tell the applicant and his sister where exactly their brother was detained and what charges had been brought against him. 12. On 20 November 1998 the applicant found out that his brother had been detained at the temporary detention centre (“the IVS”) of the Malgobek district police department (ROVD). 13. The applicant hired a lawyer, who unsuccessfully tried to reach Suleyman Tsechoyev at the detention centre. 14. In the beginning of December 1998 the applicant had a meeting with Mr Magomed Ye. The latter allegedly told him that he would release his brother in exchange for 6,000 US dollars (USD) and threatened to have Suleyman Tsechoyev transferred to the headquarters of the RUBOP in Nalchik, Kabardino-Balkaria, where he would be subjected to severe illtreatment, if the applicant refused to pay the money. The applicant refused to pay. 15. On 24 February 1999 the applicant saw his brother at the IVS. Suleyman Tsechoyev told the applicant that he had been pressured to confess to the crime and that he had been threatened with transfer to the RUBOP headquarters in Nalchik. 16. On 25 February 1999 the applicant returned to the detention centre to see his brother. He was told by the employees that the night before, at around 10 p.m., Suleyman Tsechoyev had been taken to the prosecutor's office and that after that, at about midnight, he had been taken away in a vehicle in the direction of Nalchik. 17. The Government confirmed that on 23 October 1998 Suleyman Tsechoyev had been detained by the law-enforcement bodies in accordance with the provisions of the criminal procedural legislation in force at the material time. He had been detained in connection with the investigation into Mr Magomed K.'s abduction that had been opened on 15 September 1998 and registered under file number 98540062. The decision to place Suleyman Tsechoyev under arrest had been unsuccessfully appealed against to a court. The Government submitted that the term of detention for Mr Tsechoyev had been extended on several occasions, the last of which had been on 25 May 1999; his detention had been authorised until 24 October 1999. 18. The applicant and his relatives had no news of Suleyman Tsechoyev after 25 February 1999. On 16 March 1999 a man who introduced himself as “Aslan” contacted one of the applicant's relatives. According to “Aslan”, he had been detained with Suleyman Tsechoyev in cell no. 8 in pre-trial detention centre no. 1 (SIZO-1) in Nalchik, Kabardino-Balkaria. The applicant's brother had been detained there under a false identity and had been in poor health. 19. On 17 March 1999 the applicant, together with his lawyer Mr Magomed Ga., went to Nalchik to visit his brother. The applicant's lawyer was granted permission to see Suleyman Tsechoyev. According to the lawyer, Suleyman Tsechoyev was in poor health and had no access to medical treatment. 20. On 22 March 1999 the head of the SIZO-1 medical unit provided the applicant with a handwritten statement. According to it, Suleyman Tsechoyev had been brought to SIZO-1 on 26 February 1999 with numerous bruises, abrasions, scratches on his limbs and injuries to the chest. 21. On 30 July 1999 the applicant and his sister obtained the Malgobek district prosecutor's permission to visit their brother. Suleyman Tsechoyev told them that he had been pressured to confess to the involvement in the abduction of Mr Magomed K. and that he had been ordered to convince his relatives to pay USD 6, 000 for his release. Suleyman Tsechoyev told his relatives that he had been subjected to severe beatings in the building of the RUBOP situated at 49 Naumova Street in Nalchik. Finally, he insisted that the applicant and his other relatives should not pay money for his release. It does not appear that any complaints have been lodged in this respect. 22. On 23 August 1999, at about 9 a.m., a group of four men wearing police uniforms arrived at SIZO-1 in a VAZ-2106 car. The men identified themselves as officers of the Malgobek ROVD in Ingushetia. Two of them entered the premises of the centre and produced the following documents authorising the transfer of Suleyman Tsechoyev from SIZO-1 to the Malgobek IVS: a) a letter from the acting prosecutor of Malgobek Mr U. B., dated 21 August 1999, requesting that Suleyman Tsechoyev be handed over to four officers of the Malgobek ROVD: Anzor K., Islam O., Kambulat K. and Ruslan B; b) a procedural decision in criminal case no. 98540062, dated 21 August 1999, concerning the transfer of the accused Suleyman Tsechoyev for investigative measures from SIZO-1 to the Malgobek IVS; c) an authority form, dated 23 August 1999, issued by the head of the Malgobek ROVD to officers of the Malgobek ROVD, Anzor K., Islam O., Kambulat K. and Ruslan B., concerning the transfer of Suleyman Tsechoyev to the Malgobek IVS. 23. The documents were produced to the employees of SIZO-1, officers Sh. and U., who handed Suleyman Tsechoyev over to the two men. The latter took the applicant's brother away in an unknown direction. 24. On 24 August 1999 Suleyman Tsechoyev's body was found in the Mayskiy district of Kabardino-Balkaria with gunshot wounds to the head. 25. On 7 September 1999 two RUBOP officers arrived at the applicant's house. They told him that a body whose fingerprints were consistent with those of Suleyman Tsechoyev had been found in Kabardino-Balkaria and asked him to identify it. 26. On 8 September 1999 the applicant and his sister identified the body as that of Suleyman Tsechoyev. 27. On 8 September 1999 the Kabardino-Balkaria forensic assessments office issued a report (no. 79). According to this, Suleyman Tsechoyev had died on an unspecified date from an open gunshot wound to the head. 28. It can be seen from the documents submitted by the Government that on 23 October 1999 the criminal proceedings in respect of Suleyman Tsechoyev were terminated in view of his death. 29. On 2 December 1999 the Malgobek town civil registration office issued a death certificate for Suleyman Tsechoyev. It stated that death had occurred on 23 August 1999. 30. The description of the events of the night of 23 October 1998 and the subsequent developments is based on the following documents: the applicant's accounts given on 10 and 16 February, 28 July and 29 August 2005; an account by the applicant's sister Ms L.B., given on 4 August 2005; an account by the applicant's neighbour R.G., given on 15 August 2005; a hand-drawn map of the premises of the applicant's house in Sagopshi and copies of the documents submitted with the application. 31. The Russian press widely reported the kidnapping for ransom of Magomed K., whose younger brother Musa K. had occupied a top executive position in Lukoil, one of Russia's largest oil companies, at the relevant time. It appears from the reports that Magomed K. had been freed from UrusMartan, Chechnya, some time in 1999 as a result of a raid carried out by his relatives, including Musa K., and that several well-known Chechen “field commanders” involved in the kidnapping were killed. Numerous publications also reported Suleyman Tsechoyev's murder and linked it to the kidnapping of Magomed K. Mr Magomed Ye., former deputy prosecutor of the Malgobek district, was quoted in many of these publications and wrote several articles himself. 32. It can be seen from the information submitted by the Government that the official investigation into the kidnapping of Magomed K. was closed in November 2001. 33. The Government, in response to the Court's request, submitted 380 pages from the investigation file, as well as additional information about its progress. They stated that disclosure of the remaining documents from the file could be harmful to the continuing investigation and sought application of Rule 33 § 3 of the Rules of Court to the submitted documents. 34. The applicant, in turn, submitted some additional information about his contacts with the investigation. The relevant information may be summarised as follows. 35. On 24 August 1999 the prosecutor's office of the Mayskiy district of Kabardino-Balkaria instituted an investigation under Article 105 § 1 of the Criminal Code (murder) into the death of an unknown man whose body had been found in the vicinity of Aleksandrovskaya with gunshot wounds to the head. The case file was given number 16/24-99 (in the submitted materials the number is also referred to as 16/24). 36. On 9 September 1999 the investigation into the murder of Suleyman Tsechoyev was transferred to the Kabardino-Balkaria prosecutor's office. The applicant's family was informed of this by a letter from the Prosecutor General's Office. 37. On 9 December 1999 the Ingushetia prosecutor's office opened a criminal investigation in respect of Mr Magomed Ye. under Article 285 § 3 of the Criminal Code (abuse of power entailing serious consequences), no. 99540071. On 15 March 2000 the Ingushetia prosecutor's office opened an additional investigation into abuse of power by Magomed Ye. under file number 2054007. 38. On 23 May 2000 the three cases were joined under file number 16/24-99 at the Northern Caucasus department of the General Prosecutor's Office. 39. On 9 July 2001 (in accordance with the decision of 4 September 2002 suspending the investigation, see paragraph 46 below) the investigation in respect of Mr Magomed Ye., his relatives and members of the K. family (twelve persons altogether) for abuse of power was closed. 40. On 12 July 2001 criminal charges against Magomed Ye. for murder and kidnapping were dropped for want of evidence. 41. On 15 July 2001 the investigation into the murder was suspended in view of the failure to identify the suspects. 42. On 23 July 2001 the department of the Northern Caucasus department of the General Prosecutor's Office concluded that the investigation had been incomplete. The decisions of 12 and 15 July 2001 were quashed and the investigation was remitted to an investigator of that department with a number of specific directions. 43. In December 2001 the Northern Caucasus department of the General Prosecutor's Office created a special investigative group charged with solving the crime. 44. On 15 May 2002 charges of involvement in the kidnapping and murder of Mr Magomed Ye. were dropped for want of evidence. On the same day proceedings were suspended for lack of suspects. 45. On 4 June 2002 the Russian Deputy General Prosecutor quashed the decisions of 9 July 2001 and 15 May 2002 and appointed a new investigative group, headed by the deputy head of the Northern Caucasus department of the General Prosecutor's Office. 46. On 4 September 2002 the investigation in criminal case no. 16/2499 was suspended owing to the failure to identify the perpetrators. On the same date the North Caucasus department of the Prosecutor General's Office informed the applicant of the decision. 47. On 24 August 1999 the investigators carried out an examination of the site, compiled a description of the body and collected three cartridges. Two days later an additional examination of the site resulted in the finding of another cartridge and four bullets. 48. On 25 August 1999 a forensic expert from the Mayskoye police department carried out an examination of the body and an autopsy. The expert found, inter alia, that the body bore six gunshot wounds to the left side of the head, each of which could have been lethal. The shots had been fired from a close range within a short period of time. The expert noted several bruises and abrasions on the face and hands, especially around the wrists, which had been caused within a period of twenty-four hours before death; he also noted traces indicating that the body had been dragged along immediately after the death had occurred. The expert concluded that death had occurred two or three days before the examination of the body. 49. On 23 September 1999 the ballistic expert reported that the four cartridges and bullets had been fired from one “Makarov” 9 mm calibre hand pistol. This conclusion was confirmed by a ballistic expert report of 14 November 1999, carried out by the expert department of the Ministry of the Interior of Kabardino-Balkaria. 50. On 9 September 1999 the investigator of the Mayskoye district prosecutor's office questioned the applicant. He stated that his brother had been detained on 23 October 1998 on the orders of the deputy prosecutor of the Malgobek district, Mr Magomed Ye., on suspicion of involvement in kidnapping. The applicant stated that on several occasions his brother had been transferred from one detention place to another. He had last seen him in June 1999 and Suleyman had complained that for a long time no investigative action had taken place. He also stated that in the beginning of September 1999 the investigator working on the kidnapping case had told him that he had ordered his brother's transfer to Malgobek and that he would soon be taken there. The applicant named several persons who could have been responsible for his brother's death, including former police officer Musa Kh., a cousin of the former deputy Malgobek district prosecutor Ibragim Ye., and Musa K. 51. On 30 September 1999 the investigator of the KabardinoBalkaria prosecutor's office again questioned the applicant, who gave detailed submissions relating the account of his brother's arrest and detention as summarised above. The applicant told the investigator that his brother had close friends in Urus-Martan, Chechnya, where he regularly travelled. He also stated that he suspected Magomed Ye. of masterminding and carrying out the operation aimed at abducting Suleyman Tsechoyev from the pretrial detention centre. He stated that Magomed Ye. had possessed the knowledge required to produce the papers necessary to organise the prisoner's transfer, that he had the necessary computer and other technical skills and that he had been rewarded by the relatives of Magomed K. In particular, the applicant stated that he was aware that Magomed Ye. had obtained from those relatives a VAZ vehicle, a computer, a mobile phone and that he had bought a flat in Nalchik, Kabardino-Balkaria, with money received from them. Furthermore, the applicant accused Magomed Ye. of being present when his brother had been beaten by relatives of Magomed K. outside Malgobek in February 1999. He again accused the K. family of organising his brother's murder and said that the crime could have been carried out by Magomed Ye., Musa Kh, Zaurbek Kh. and Mukhszhir Ye. 52. On the same day the applicant's sister L.B. told the investigator that she had visited her brother in prison, that he had not complained of anything but had denied that he had been involved in the kidnapping. She also named Magomed Ye. and Musa K., brother of the kidnapped Magomed K., as the possible perpetrators of the killing. 53. On 30 September 1999 the applicant and his sister L. B. were granted the status of victims in the criminal proceedings relating to their brother's murder. On 17 April 2000 the applicant was granted the status of victim in the criminal investigation carried out “into the unlawful actions of the former deputy prosecutor of the Malgobek town, Mr M[agomed] Ye.” 54. On 11 November 1999 the applicant and L. B. wrote to the Malgobek district prosecutor. They accused Mr Magomed Ye. of allowing the beating of their brother on the night of 24 to 25 February 1999 by two relatives of Ye. and by the relatives of Magomed K. They again submitted that Ye. had obtained property from the family of Magomed K. in return for his “assistance” in the solving of his kidnapping. 55. On 28 November 1999 the applicant's sister told the investigators that on 3 April 1999 she had visited her brother in prison and that on that day she had noticed marks from handcuffs and traces of beatings on his face. She also submitted that Suleyman Tsechoyev had told her that during the night of 24 February 1999 Magomed Ye. and his relatives, together with relatives of Magomed K., had taken him outside of Malgobek and beaten him in an attempt to obtain a confession regarding the kidnapping. 56. On 15 December 1999 the applicant gave detailed submissions to an investigator from the Ingushetia prosecutor's office relating the arrest and detention of his brother, as described above. In addition, he submitted that on 3 April 1999 his brother had told him in great detail what had happened on the night of 24 to 25 February 1999 and named other persons who had been detained with him and questioned by the relatives of Magomed K. He also allegedly told him that he had been taken to several detention centres in the Northern Caucasus prior to being admitted to the pre-trial detention centre no. 1 in Nalchik because he had suffered from the beatings and the officials had refused to accept him. The applicant named Mr Magomed Ye. as the individual responsible for the ill-treatment of his brother and, ultimately, for organising his transfer to the murderers. He stressed that the documents authorising his brother's removal from the prison in Nalchik had been produced by someone who had detailed knowledge of the requirements for such documents and that the forgery had necessitated considerable computer skills. The applicant also submitted that on 28 August 1999 he had gone to the SIZO no. 1 in Nalchik and left a food parcel for his brother, which had been accepted. At that time he had not been informed that his brother was no longer detained there. 57. On 17 December 1999 the applicant's sister repeated her previous statements. She stated, further, that in May and October 1999 Mr Ye. had threatened to kill her brother, the applicant. 58. On 17 December 1999 the applicant's mother gave statements similar to those of the applicant and her daughter. 59. On 21 April 2000 the applicant was questioned by an investigator from the Ingushetia prosecutor's office again. He repeated his allegations against Magomed Ye. 60. On 16 October 2001 the investigator from the Ingushetia prosecutor's office questioned the applicant again. He supplemented his previous statements and claimed that Mr Magomed Ye. had been acting in cooperation with the relatives of Magomed K. from the very early stages of the investigation. He stated that as early as September 1998 a number of men, whose names he had supplied to the investigation, had been arrested and then transferred to private residences where they had been beaten and tortured with the aim of extracting confessions. According to the applicant, Mr Magomed Ye. had participated in these actions and filmed them. The applicant also claimed that in February 1999 Mr Ye. had asked his mother and sister to pay USD 6,000 in return for his brother's release. He also submitted additional details about the circumstances of his brother's beatings on 24 February 1999. 61. The investigators questioned the staff at the pre-trial detention centre in Nalchik who had been on duty on 23 August 1999. On 10 September 1999 two officers stated that they had inspected the papers of the two men who had presented themselves as police officers from the Malgobek ROVD and had not found them suspicious. They had organised the transfer of Suleyman Tsechoyev to the two men in accordance with the usual procedure. One of the men bore the distinction of a Senior Lieutenant, the other of a non-commissioned officer of the Ministry of the Interior. The men had spoken Ingush between themselves; one of them had had a Motorolla radio receiver but had not used it during the encounter. One of the officers gave a detailed physical description of the two men and said that he would be prepared to identify them. The deputy head of the detention centre, Mr Zaurbi Sh., told the investigators that he had checked the names of the two men and the papers for the prisoner's transfer. He had not inspected their documents because, according to the relevant procedure, the identity documents should have been left at the entrance to the building. 62. Several of Suleyman Tsechoyev's co-detainees in the pretrial detention centre in Nalchik stated on 10 September 1999 that the deceased had not raised any complaints, that he had been visited by a lawyer and by his brother and that in August 1999 he had been taken away, apparently for transfer to Ingushetia. 63. On 12 October 1999 the acting prosecutor of the Malgobek district told the investigators that he had ordered Mr Tsechoyev's transfer to Malgobek on 5 August 1999, but for unknown reasons that order had not been complied with. The documents which had enabled Mr Tsechoyev to be kidnapped had been forged and their numbers corresponded to other documents. The persons indicated in the escort documents had not worked at the Malgbek ROVD. In June 2002 he gave a further statement, describing Mr Magomed Ye. as an honest and motivated officer who had been falsely accused by the applicant and his relatives. 64. On 15 November 1999 an officer from the Nalchik pre-trial detention centre identified a man from a photo as one of those who had collected Suleyman Tsechoyev on 23 August 1999. Later that man, a worker in a gas plant, submitted reliable evidence that he had not been in Kabardino-Balkaria at the time, as supported by documents and witness statements collected by the investigation. 65. On 22 December 1999 the head of the Malgobek ROVD stated that Suleyman Tsechoyev had been detained at the Malgobek IVS from September 1998 to February 1999. He was shown the registration log of the IVS, according to which on 24 February 1999 Mr Tsechoyev had been taken out of the IVS at 11.40 p.m. by the local police officer Musa Kh. The head of the ROVD explained that he had been informed late at night by the officer on duty that the deputy district prosecutor had ordered that Mr Tsechoyev be brought to his office for questioning. At first the head of the ROVD had refused, but Mr Ye. had called him and insisted, threatening to open a criminal investigation if he did not comply. Mr Ye. explained that he had senior officers of the Ministry of the Interior in his office and that it was possible that Mr Tsechoyev would be transferred to Kabardino-Balkaria for further investigation. The head of the ROVD then agreed, but instructed his staff to obtain Mr Ye.'s signature to the effect that he had accepted the detainee. He could not explain why a district police officer, Mr Musa Kh., had signed. When questioned about Suleyman Tsechoyev's abduction and murder, the head of the police confirmed that the men identified in the escort documents had never served at the ROVD and that he had not issued the documents in question. 66. In addition to the above investigative documents, copies of which the Government submitted to the Court, it can be seen from their memorandum of 2 October 2008 that the investigators also questioned five acting and former officers of the Malgobek prosecutor's office, all of whom denied that they had been aware of any connection between the K. family and Magomed Ye. One of these officers, quoted by the Government, stated that Suleyman Tsechoyev had been a member of the bandit group based in UrusMartan, along with three other men who had been charged with kidnappings. 67. The Government also submitted a copy of the record of interview of Zaurbek Kh., who stated that he had permanently lived in Moscow and had been there throughout the summer of 1999. Zaurbek Kh. denied having known Suleyman Tsechoyev; as to Magomed Ye., the witness stated that he had gone to the same school but had not kept in contact in recent years. 68. On 16 November 1999 the investigators in criminal case no. 16/2499 carried out an expert assessment of three documents concerning the transfer of Suleyman Tsechoyev from SIZO-1 on 23 August 1999. The criminology expert of Kabardino-Balkaria concluded that the imprint of the Malgobek district prosecutor's office's seal had been reproduced with the aid of a factory-made stamp, but not the one used by the district prosecutor's office. The imprint of the Malgobek ROVD seal had been reproduced with the aid of a colour printer. A graphology expert report reported difficulties in analysing short notes with dates and signatures on the documents, but concluded that some of the notes could have been made by Mr Magomed Ye., his brother and by the acting Malgobek prosecutor. 69. On 14 December 1999 the Central North-Caucasus forensic laboratory issued an additional expert assessment. It concluded that the signatures on all the documents concerning the transfer of Suleyman Tsechoyev from SIZO-1 to the Malgobek IVS had been forged, and that the date and signature on one of the documents had been written by Mr Magomed Ye. 70. In October 2001 the investigators questioned a number of experts from the Central North-Caucasus forensic laboratory seeking an explanation for the differences in the reports. The experts referred to the incomplete conclusions of some of the studies. 71. On 12 November 2001 the Russian Federal Forensic Assessments Office of the Ministry of Justice concluded that it was impossible to establish with certainty whether the handwritten words on the document in question had been written by Mr Magomed Ye. or not. 72. According to the documents contained in the criminal investigation file, at some point in 2001 documents constituting the basis for examination and a part of the original expert report had been stolen or changed. A separate criminal investigation was carried out, during which several officers from the prosecutor's office and the Ministry of the Interior were questioned. The investigation collected the copies of the original documents from the Russian Federal Bureau of Forensic Studies. Magomed Ye. was questioned as a suspect. On 15 May 2002 the investigation against him was closed for want of incriminating evidence. 73. On 7 October 1999 the investigator from the Kabardino-Balkaria prosecutor's office questioned Magomed Ye. The latter confirmed that he had headed the group at the Malgobek prosecutor's office which had investigated the kidnapping of Magomed K. He had authorised Suleyman Tsechoyev's detention in relation to that crime. According to him, Mr Tsechoyev had been suspected of involvement in other crimes committed in the region, which was the reason for his transfer to Nalchik and Pyatigorsk. Mr Ye. denied that he had been involved in the kidnapping and murder of Suleyman Tsechoyev. He stated that he had never seen the documents authorising the latter's removal from the pre-trial detention centre in Nalchik in August 1999. Mr Ye. stated that he had quit his job at the prosecutor's office in March 1999 and now lived in Moscow. He had learnt of Suleyman Tsechoyev's death from his father in September 1999. He denied that he had previously allowed the relatives of Magomed K. access to Suleyman Tsechoyev. 74. In October 1999 the investigators carried out a series of identification parades, during which the officers of the Nalchik pretrial detention centre failed to identify Mr Magomed Ye., his brothers and cousins as the persons who had taken away Suleyman Tsechoyev. 75. On 11 January 2000 the Kabardino-Balkaria prosecutor's office brought charges against Mr Magomed Ye. He was charged in absentia with complicity in Suleyman Tsechoyev's kidnapping and murder and forgery of official documents. On the same day Mr Magomed Ye. was ordered to be arrested and declared a fugitive from justice, and his name was put on the wanted list. 76. On 26 February 2000 Mr Ye. was detained and questioned as a suspect. He again denied any connection with the murder and requested a number of additional investigative measures. 77. The investigators obtained the documents according to which in March 1999 Mr Magomed Ye. had complained to his superior about the false accusations brought against him by the relatives of Suleyman Tsechoyev and requested the district prosecutor of Malgobek to open a criminal investigation for libel. At the same time, pending completion of the investigation, he requested to be relieved from the duty of investigating the case. On 31 March 1999 Magomed Ye. resigned from the prosecutor's office. 78. On 10 March 2000 the Nalchik Town Court released Mr Magomed Ye. from detention, having found that there were no reasons to suspect him of absconding from justice. The court noted that Mr Ye. had always appeared at the prosecutor's office when summoned to do so, resided at his declared place of residence in Moscow and had other family reasons not to abscond. 79. In April 2000 a waitress in a roadside café in KabardinoBalkaria told the investigators that between 21 and 25 August 1999 she had seen Mr Magomed Ye. During a confrontation carried out on 24 January 2002 she retracted her statements and explained that she had last seen him in March 1999, and that in August 1999 she had seen another person whom she had confused with Mr Ye. She gave detailed submissions in this respect. Two other men and Magomed Ye. gave concordant statements. 80. In July 2001 the investigators questioned witnesses and obtained documents to the effect that in August 1999 Mr Ye. had been working daily for a private company in Moscow. 81. In April 2002 Magomed Ye. gave an additional statement as a suspect. He again denied any involvement in the imputed crime, denied having ever received or used a VAZ vehicle and denied receiving any money or property from the K. family. 82. In their memorandum of 2 October 2008 the Government stated, without providing copies of such documents or the dates when they were obtained, that the investigators also questioned four members of the K. family who denied having any relations with Magomed Ye. or giving him money or property. These and other witnesses suggested that the libel campaign against Magomed Ye. had been inspired by members of a fundamentalist bandit group based in Urus-Martan, Chechnya, who had committed numerous kidnappings for ransom. The Kabardino-Balkaria Land Registry reported that Magomed Ye. had owned no real estate in that region. 83. In their memorandum of 2 October 2008 the Government also stated, without providing copies of such documents or the dates when they were obtained, that the investigators had also questioned the brother and cousin of Magomed Ye.: police officers named by the applicant as possible perpetrators of the crime. They denied their involvement in the events. The police department of Malgobek confirmed that Magomed Ye.'s cousin had been working daily between July and September 1999. Police officers Musa Kh. and Zaurbek Kh. were also questioned at some point and denied having any connection with the murder. The Government also referred to records of interviews of four members of the K. family who stated that they had no relations with Magomed Ye. outside the official framework of the investigation and that they had not given him money or property. 84. As can be seen from the statements collected in January 2008 from the applicant and his father, some time in 2001 police officer Musa Kh. had been charged with false imprisonment and abuse of power in relation to the taking of Suleyman Tsechoyev from the Malgobek IVS in the late hours on 24 February 1999. He had been found guilty and given a suspended sentence; the applicant did not appeal against the sentence. It also appears from these statements that the applicant and Musa Kh. had reached an informal agreement prior to the trial and that the applicant had “accepted” Musa Kh.'s “apology” and declaration that he had not been involved in his brother's murder. No other documents or information relating to this process have been submitted by the parties. 85. It can be seen from the submitted documents that in 2001 Musa K., the brother of the kidnapped Magomed K., complained to the prosecutor's office that he had been libelled by the applicant. It appears that in June 2001 the indictment was sent to the court, which at some point acquitted the applicant. 86. The investigators into the kidnapping of Magomed K. suspected and arrested several other men in addition to Suleyman Tsechoyev. Later, three of them were charged with other kidnappings; one of them was found guilty and sentenced in 2001; and two others were charged in absentia and their names put on the wanted list. One of them told the investigators that the applicant had threatened to denounce him to the law-enforcement bodies in order to give incriminating evidence against Magomed Ye. and Musa K. 87. On 26 February 2002 the criminal investigation was closed regarding the part concerning the actions of the officers of the Nalchik pretrial detention centre, on grounds of absence of corpus delicti. 88. On the same day the investigator from the department of the General Prosecutor's Office in the North Caucasus closed the criminal proceedings against Magomed Ye. for want of evidence. He noted that it had turned out to be impossible to identify the persons who had abducted and killed Suleyman Tsechoyev; that the conclusions of the graphology expert reports were contradictory and could not be construed as a single body of incriminating evidence against Mr Magomed Ye.; that by the time of the abduction he had no longer been employed at the prosecutor's office for more than six months and there was no evidence that he had continued to be aware of or to influence the proceedings; that between March and September 1999 he had remained in Moscow, as confirmed by witness statements and documents; that the allegations that he had obtained money or property from the K. family had proved to be unfounded; and, finally, that there were reasons to suspect that the applicant had personal motives, since he was being prosecuted for libel against the K. family and had threatened a witness in order to obtain evidence incriminating Magomed Ye. 89. On 22 May 2001 the Prosecutor General's Office informed the applicant that on 11 April 2001 the investigation in criminal case no. 16/2499 had been transferred to the department of the Prosecutor General's office in the North Caucasus. According to the letter, Mr Ye. had absconded from the authorities and his name had been put on the wanted list. 90. On 7 January 2002 the applicant and his relatives complained of the ineffectiveness of the investigation in criminal case no. 16/24-99 to the Prosecutor General. In his letter the applicant also alleged that some of the evidence in the criminal case-file materials had been forged by the investigators. 91. On 22 February 2002 the Prosecutor General's Office replied to the applicant. The letter stated that in connection with the forgery of the evidence in criminal case no. 16/24-99, they had opened criminal case no. 18/24411-01 on 14 September 2001. 92. On 15 or 24 May 2002 (the letter has two dates) the department of the Prosecutor General's Office in the North Caucasus informed the applicant that on 15 May 2002 the authorities had terminated the criminal proceedings against Mr Ye. owing to the failure to prove his involvement in the abduction of Suleyman Tsechoyev. On the same date the investigation had been suspended owing to the failure to identify the perpetrators. 93. On 20 June 2002 the applicant and his relatives wrote to the Prosecutor General complaining of the ineffectiveness of the criminal investigation into the murder. 94. On 9 August 2002 the applicant's family received a letter from the Prosecutor General's Office. The letter stated that on an unspecified date the investigation of criminal case no. 16/24-99 had been resumed. 95. On 28 February 2003 the applicant complained about his brother's murder to the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation. In his letter he complained of the ineffectiveness of the investigation into the crime and the decisions suspending it. The applicant requested the authorities to resume the investigation and carry out an additional examination of the evidence in criminal case no. 16/24-99. In particular, he complained that the investigation had failed to compile a composite sketch of the two men who had collected his brother from the pre-trial detention centre and to compare the handwriting of the kidnappers with those of all the officers of the Ministry of the Interior in Ingushetia and KabardinoBalkaria, as well as of the regional department of the RUBOP in the Northern Caucasus. 96. On 5 March 2003 the Prosecutor General's Office, upon the applicant's request, forwarded him a copy of the decision of 4 September 2002 suspending the investigation in criminal case no. 16/24-99. 97. It does not appear that the applicant or the investigators took any steps between 5 March 2003 and 20 May 2005. 98. On 20 May 2005 the applicant's representatives wrote to the Prosecutor General. They requested information concerning the progress reached in the investigation in criminal case no. 16/24-99 and enquired whether the investigators had carried out any expert or forensic examinations in the case. It does not appear that the applicant's representatives received any response to this request. 99. On 21 August 2007 the Deputy Prosecutor General quashed the decision suspending the proceedings. On 25 December 2007 Mr Magomed Ye. was placed under an obligation not to leave his place of residence in Moscow. 100. In January 2008 the investigator questioned the applicant, his sister and his mother in Malgobek. They denied that Suleyman Tsechoyev had any connections to illegal armed groups in Chechnya or in Ingushetia, pointed out that he had never been charged with any such crime before and affirmed that there was no evidence to support that allegation. They again insisted that Magomed Ye. had been connected with the abduction and murder of their brother, in view of his involvement in the arrest and beatings. 101. On 21 May 2008 the father of Musa and Magomed K. gave a statement in which he denied that his family had ever given any money or valuables to Magomed Ye. or his family. 102. In his submissions the applicant also described attacks by unspecified persons on himself, his relative and his house. 103. Accordingly, the applicant submitted that on 13 July 2001 he and Mrs U. had been wounded during an attempt to arrest them by officers from the RUBOP of Kabardino-Balkaria. On the same day the Ingushetia prosecutor's office opened a criminal investigation into violent acts against public officers. 104. However, in January 2002 the investigation was adjourned in view of the failure to identify the suspect. In March 2004 criminal charges against the applicant were dropped; Mrs U. was granted victim status. 105. The applicant and Mrs U. sought damages for the injuries and moral suffering inflicted by the RUBOP and the Federal Treasury. They also contested the lawfulness of the order to deliver the applicant to an investigator which had served as the basis for the attempt to arrest him. 106. In October 2004 the Malgobek Town Court refused to grant their claim, referring to the absence of any definitive outcome of the criminal investigation and the applicant's failure to appeal against the decision to adjourn the proceedings. An appeal by the applicant was dismissed without consideration for failure to observe the requisite time-limits; he tried to have the time-limits restored but it appears that his complaint to the Supreme Court of Ingushetia remained unexamined. 107. No complaints were brought following those developments, but the applicant relied on the above proceedings to explain his inaction between 2003 and 2005 vis-à-vis the domestic criminal investigation into his brother's murder. 108. The applicant submitted, referring to numerous publications concerning the subject, that following the events described above Mr Magomed Ye. had become a well-known political figure in Ingushetia. As a successful businessman and journalist, he had founded an Internet site (www.Ingushetiya.ru) in 2001 which had quickly become an important media forum for the opposition forces. In 2008 Mr Magomed Ye. had become one of the organisers of the “I did not vote” campaign aimed at denouncing electoral fraud in Ingushetia during the Russian presidential elections. In June 2008 a district court in Moscow classified the site as “extremist” and demanded its closure. The order could not be implemented because the site was hosted in the United States. 109. On 31 August 2008 Mr Magomed Ye. was detained on arrival at the airport in Nazran, Ingushetia, and shot dead in the police car. In December 2009 a court in Ingushetia found one officer of the Ministry of the Interior of Ingushetia guilty of causing death by negligence and gave him a suspended sentence. In August 2010 this officer was killed by unknown gunmen in Ingushetia. On 25 October 2009 another former coowner of the Ingushetia.ru site, Mr Maksharip A., was killed by unknown gunmen in Kabardino-Balkaria.",['2'],[],[],['2'],[],[],1
198,001-98443,ENG,ISL,CHAMBER,2010,CASE OF VÖRĐUR ÓLAFSSON v. ICELAND,1,Violation of Art. 11,Giovanni Bonello;Ján Šikuta;Ledi Bianku;Nebojša Vučinić;Nicolas Bratza;Päivi Hirvelä,"6. The applicant, Mr Vörður Ólafsson, is an Icelandic national who was born in 1961 and lives in Reykjavik. 7. The applicant is a master builder and is a member of the Master Builders’ Association (“the MBA”). Under the Industry Charge Act (Law no. 134/1993 – “the 1993 Act”), he was under an obligation to pay a levy known as the “industry charge” to the Federation of Icelandic Industries (“the FII”), an organisation of which the applicant was not a member and to which the MBA was not affiliated. The 1993 Act provided that a charge of 0.08% should be levied on all industrial activities in Iceland as defined in the Act. The definition included all activities coming under activity code numbers enumerated in an appendix to the Act. Private-sector enterprises not covered by the code numbers were not subject to the industry charge. This was the case, for example, for enterprises in the meat-processing, milk-processing and fish-processing industries. Other enterprises in the food and drink industry were covered. Enterprises entirely under public ownership or established by special statute were not covered (section 2). Revenues from the industry charge were to be transferred to the FII, and were to be used for the promotion and development of industry in Iceland (section 3). The State Treasury was to receive 0.5% of the charge collected in order to cover the costs of its collection (section 1). 8. More than 10,000 persons (legal persons and self-employed individuals) paid the industry charge. The FII had between 1,100 and 1,200 members (enterprises and self-employed individuals). 9. The Government supplied copies of the FII’s reports to the Ministry of Industry regarding the disbursement of the industry charge for the years 2000, 2003 and 2006. 10. The FII’s report for the year 2003 (dated 4 July 2004) stated: “The Federation’s accounts have not indicated whether particular operational items are paid for with funds from membership fees, capital income or the industry charge, because an overwhelming proportion of its work benefits industrial companies whether they are members of the Federation or not. The Ministry of Industry has not expressed any reservation regarding this arrangement, and legislation concerning the industry charge imposes no other requirements. The Federation and the Ministry of Industry are, however, in agreement about the requirement for a more detailed account of how the industry charge is disbursed, and that has been done in this report.” 11. Under the title “Disbursement of the industry charge in 2003 according to the Federation’s accounts”, the report included a table showing the “Income and expenditure according to the Federation’s audited accounts for the year 2003”. In a separate column the table indicated the percentage of funds originating from the industry charge in relation to each item and sub-item. This included the following items: “Operating profits” and “Operating expenses”. It also detailed “Further itemisation of disbursement of the industry charge according to the accounts”, namely: (1) “Wages and related expenses”; (2) “Meetings and conferences”; (3) “Promotional activities”; (4) “Publications”; (5) “Branches and special projects”; and (6) “General and administrative expenses”. For each of these sub-items the report contained explanatory notes, providing information on the treatment of members as compared with non-members. For example, under sub-item (1) it was stated that 2.5 of the 20 man-years concerned work that benefited members only. With reference to sub-item (3) it was stated that FII exhibitions were open to everyone and that FII members enjoyed a discount on participation fees. Under sub-item (5) it was stated that non-members could access the quality management project but would be charged a higher fee than members. 12. From the table it appears that in 2003 the FII’s operating revenues totalled 315,800,000 Icelandic krónur (ISK), of which ISK 197,359,000 had originated from the industry charge transferred to the FII by the State Treasury; ISK 84,973,000 from membership fees; and ISK 33,468,000 from other income. That same year, the operating expenses had totalled ISK 289,654,000, of which ISK 234,617,000 (81%) had been spent on public projects (comprising ISK 197,359,000 derived from the industry charge and ISK 37,258,000 from membership fees and other income). 13. The Government explained that in fulfilling its role and objectives of promoting Icelandic industry pursuant to section 3 of the 1993 Act, the FII notably worked to develop and protect the image of the industry, allocated large amounts of the funds obtained though the industry charge to training, gave opinions on behalf of the business community on draft legislation and regulations in the sphere of environmental affairs, and instilled in public authorities the need to observe restraint in public procurement and to observe clear and transparent tender rules. 14. At the material time, the applicant paid the following amounts in industry charge for the years indicated: for 2001 ISK 23,023 (255 euros (EUR)); for 2002 ISK 20,639 (EUR 229); for 2003 ISK 12,567 (EUR 139); and for 2004 ISK 5,946 (EUR 66). 15. On 8 November 2004 the applicant lodged proceedings against the State with the Reykjavik District Court, requesting an order to exempt him from the charges imposed on him in respect of the years 2001 to 2004. 16. By a judgment of 13 July 2005, the District Court found in favour of the State and dismissed the applicant’s action. 17. The applicant appealed to the Supreme Court of Iceland, arguing, inter alia, that section 3 of the 1993 Act meant that all individuals and companies engaged in particular business activities had to pay membership fees to the FII, irrespective of whether they were members or not. The applicant considered that Article 14 of the Articles of the Federation, which provided for the membership charge, clearly reflected its nature in that, as was provided therein, FII members paying an industry charge which was transferred to the FII should have that part deducted from their membership fees. Thus, by the levy and collection of the charge, membership of the FII was in fact made compulsory for others, although they enjoyed no rights vis-à-vis the FII. Consequently, the industry charge was merely a membership fee to the FII. The applicant submitted that he was a member of the MBA, to which he paid his fees and through which he considered his interests to be best served, and he had no wish to be a member of the FII. The latter pursued policies with which he disagreed and which were contrary to his own interests. The compulsory membership of the FII was incompatible with his right to freedom of association as protected by Article 74 § 2 of the Icelandic Constitution and Article 11 of the Convention. The applicant also argued that by virtue of the 1993 Act, he was unjustifiably taxed in excess of other taxes and that, under the Act, a limited group was being taxed “for the benefit of another limited group or the restricted interests of others”. Finally, he submitted that the imposition of the charge amounted to discrimination in breach of Article 65 of the Constitution, as the taxation was dependent upon the ownership structure of an enterprise, and the enumeration of activity code numbers, on which the taxation was based, was haphazard in nature. The State disputed the applicant’s submission that the industry charge constituted a membership fee to the FII. They argued that by law it was a tax levied by the State on particular groups of individuals and legal persons, in accordance with general and applicable standards, without anything being required in return. By the same Act, the decision had been taken to have the charge transferred to the FII, which was to use it for the promotion and development of Icelandic industry. Such an allocation of tax revenues to an association provided for by law did not mean that those who paid the relevant tax were thereby obliged by law to become members of it. The charge was not expected to be used for the benefit of the members alone, but for the benefit of all industries and industrial development in Iceland, under the supervision of the Ministry of Industry. Any discounts on membership fees were decided unilaterally by the FII, without any connection to the assessment and collection of the charge. The State also denied that the 1993 Act involved discrimination between persons who were in the appellant’s situation and those who enjoyed an exemption from the charge. It was a reasonable and objective arrangement to exempt public enterprises from the charge, and it was in the nature of things that the considerations that applied to companies under public ownership were different from those relating to private enterprises. The State also argued that public support for industry and industrial development sometimes took the form of launching industrial activities that others were not capable of initiating. Finally, the number of publicly owned industrial enterprises had been greatly reduced in recent years. The State also disputed the allegation that the enumeration of activity code numbers governing the taxation had been haphazard. 18. By a judgment of 20 December 2005, the Supreme Court, by four votes to one, rejected the applicant’s appeal and upheld the District Court’s judgment. It held as follows: “As mentioned in the District Court’s judgment, the Supreme Court rendered a judgment on 17 December 1998 in case no. 166/1998, Gunnar Pétursson v. the Republic of Iceland, published at page 4406 of the Court’s Reports for that year. The appellant in that case requested an exemption from his liability to pay the industry loan fund charge and the industry charge for the years 1995 and 1996. He based his case on arguments that are to a significant degree identical to those invoked by the appellant in the present case. The Supreme Court accepts the view of the respondent in that the above-mentioned case must be regarded as the precedent in the case now to be determined, to the extent that the issues raised by the appellant in support of his present claim were determined in that case. In the earlier case the appellant, as here, maintained that as a result of his liability to pay the industry charge, which is to be transferred to the Federation of Icelandic Industries, he was obliged to be a member of the Federation. The Supreme Court mentioned in its judgment that although the charge was transferred to the Federation, it was to be used for a certain purpose (see section 3 of the 1993 Act), and did not constitute a grant to the Federation. The use of the revenues was subject to the supervision of the Ministry of Industry. The Court accepted that this arrangement did not involve obligatory membership of the Federation of Icelandic Industries in breach of the Constitution and the European Convention [on Human Rights]. It also noted that even if the Federation of Icelandic Industries had exceeded the boundaries laid down in the [1993] Act, this could not have the effect of exempting the appellant from paying the charge. With this in mind, and in other respects by reference to the grounds stated in the contested judgment, the Court must reject the conclusion that the appellant’s arguments in this regard may lead to a granting of his request. Bearing in mind that the Federation of Icelandic Industries is under a legal duty to use the revenues from the industry charge for promoting Icelandic industries and industrial development, and consequently for the benefit of the activities being taxed, the Court cannot accept that the legislature thus exceeded its powers. The appellant submits that equality was not respected, since enterprises under public ownership may be exempted from the charge. As regards this argument, it must be noted that various factors distinguish enterprises under public ownership from privately owned enterprises, and in various fields their taxation is governed by different considerations, as seen in Icelandic tax legislation in general. In his written submissions, the appellant did not present a comparison of his situation vis-à-vis any particular public enterprises. It has not been established that any discrimination has taken place between the appellant and the parties to whom the exemptions of the [1993] Act apply. Finally, the appellant bases his request on the assertion that the activity code enumeration, by reference to which taxation under section 2(1) of the 1993 Act takes place, is haphazard in nature. The charge is levied on industry, subsequently defined as any activity coming under the activity code numbers enumerated in the classification of Icelandic business activities in an appendix to the 1993 Act, as amended by Law no. 81/1996. Industry, thus defined, does not only cover manufacturing industry, but also processing and services, including the construction industry. This defines the activities to be included under the term ‘industry’ within the meaning of the [1993] Act, distinguishing them from other fields of economic activity, including activities that have developed within the fields of agriculture and fishing. Such classification of economic activity has furthermore been recognised as a basis for other forms of taxation other than the industry charge. The appellant’s claim cannot be granted on the basis of the arguments presented.” 19. The dissenting member of the Supreme Court, Mr Justice Ólafur Börkur Þorvaldsson, gave a separate opinion containing, inter alia, the following reasons: “I The original Industry Charge Act was Law no. 48/1975. It was stated in the explanatory notes to the draft law that it had been submitted in accordance with a recommendation of the FII, the National Federation of Craftsmen, and the Union of Icelandic Cooperative Societies. These provided a detailed report, which apparently was adopted verbatim in the explanatory notes. It included the observation that ‘... it may be noted that industrial enterprises and self-employed persons in industry collect various taxes for public authorities, both from their employees and from the consumers. The tax collection they carry out and are responsible for amounts to thousands of millions annually, entirely without remuneration. It therefore seems reasonable that the State should undertake to collect, by way of compensation for these parties, a charge which amounts to only a small fraction of what they collect for the State. This source of revenue should create a financial basis for more active participation by professional federations within Icelandic industry in shaping future industrial development’. The Act also contained a provision similar to that of the Act now in effect, that the Ministry of Industry should be sent an annual report on the use of the revenues derived from the charge. In this context, it was mentioned in the explanatory notes that this was a ‘provision intended to ensure that public authorities will be given a reasonable account of how the industry charge is used’. Law no. 48/1975 was superseded by the present Law no. 134/1993. It was stated in the explanatory notes to the [1993] Act that those liable for the charge would be the same as before, but a system of reference to activity code numbers in accordance with the business activity classification of the Bureau of Statistics was adopted in order to ‘remove any doubt as to who are liable for this charge’. It was furthermore provided that the revenues derived from the charge should be transferred to the FII in their entirety, whereas under the previous Act they had been distributed between the Union of Icelandic Cooperative Societies, the Canning Industry Sales Office, the Federation of Icelandic Industrialists and the National Federation of Craftsmen. At the same time the tax base was changed, since the municipal business tax, on which the level of tax had previously been determined, had been abolished. II According to the Articles of its Statute, the FII is a federation of enterprises, self-employed persons, trades and master builders’ associations, who jointly wish to pursue common goals as enumerated in Article 2. This Article states the purpose and role of the Federation in ten points, as involving the promotion of Icelandic industries in various ways and supporting the members by all the means which are detailed therein. According to the documents submitted, the association involves itself with political issues, for example as regards membership of the European Union and taxation in various fields. Pursuant to Article 8, each member of the Federation enjoys voting rights at its meetings in proportion to his paid membership fees. It is provided in Article 14 that the membership fees are a maximum of 0.15% of the previous year’s turnover, but the board of the Federation may decide to collect lower membership fees. The provision goes on to state that ‘[p]arties paying an industry charge that is transferred to the Federation shall have that part recognised, and deducted when their membership fees to the Federation are calculated. If the industry charge is no longer levied, this deduction shall automatically be abolished. The voting right of each member shall be calculated on the basis of his paid membership fee. Management and decision-making within the Federation is, as generally within associations, the responsibility of its board and the managing director’. Documents submitted from the FII relating to the period to which the [applicant’s] requests pertain do not contain a clear breakdown of how the industry charge is used. It also appears from a comment in the Federation’s reports on the use of the charge for the years 2002 and 2003 that the Federation does ‘not keep separate accounts of whether the individual elements of the Federation’s operations are financed by monies derived from membership fees, capital income, or the industry charge’. A similar declaration on this point is found in the report to the Minister in respect of the year 2001, but a report for 2004 is not in the case file. The Federation’s reports to the Minister are also in other respects similar from year to year. In fact the case file seems to permit the inference that part of the charge is used for the general management of the Federation. It cannot be seen from the submissions in this case that the Minister of Industry has made any observations concerning the use of the charge, and in a letter to the Master Builders’ Association of 15 February 2002, following complaints relating to the use of the charge, he expresses the following opinion: ‘As can be clearly seen from the Industry Charge Act, the FII has the unrestricted power to decide how the charge is allocated, and the Ministry of Industry cannot interfere with this as long as it remains within the framework of the law.’ It can be seen from the submitted reports of the FII for the periods to which this case relates that the arrangement has been used for granting those members of the Federation who pay the industry charge a discount on their membership fees equal to the amount of the charge. As an example, the following comment in the Federation’s report to the Minister of Industry for 2003 may be quoted: ‘It may be pointed out that members who pay the industry charge have it deducted in full from their membership fees to the Federation. It would not be considered proper that companies within the Federation that are liable to the industry charge should pay more to the Federation’s activities than companies that are members, but not liable to the charge. In this way all the member companies of the Federation make equal payments to the Federation, irrespective of whether they are liable to the industry charge or not. On the other hand other companies, remaining outside, only pay the industry charge and thus make a contribution to the general protection of the interests of Icelandic industries.’ III Provisions on freedom of association are found in Article 74 of the Constitution ... They contain more detailed rules on freedom of association than those directly expressed in Article 11 of the Convention ... Article 74 § 2 of the Constitution provides: ‘No one may be obliged to be a member of any association. Membership of an association may, however, be made obligatory by law if this is necessary in order to enable an association to discharge its functions in the public interest or on account of the rights of others.’ As noted above, the purpose of the industry charge is, according to the 1993 Act, the promotion of Icelandic industry, but it is also expressly provided that only the part of the charge corresponding to the cost of its collection is to be transferred to the State Treasury. The remainder is transferred to the FII, to be used as the Federation decides. It also seems that an unspecified proportion of the charge is used for the general activities of the Federation as its board may decide. It can furthermore not be seen from the provisions of the 1993 Act that the Minister of Industry is adequately empowered to ensure that the charge is used in the manner provided for in the Act; in this regard, the Minister simply receives the reports of the Federation. For these reasons the provisions of the 1993 Act cannot be regarded as ensuring that the charge will be used for the activities the Act requires. The payment of membership fees to an association is generally a chief obligation of the members of an association that requires such payments. The applicant is a member of the Master Builders’ Association. Neither he nor his association is a member of the FII. The applicant does not agree with the Federation’s objectives in various fields, considering, as mentioned in the contested judgment, that the Federation acts contrary to his interests, and indeed also contrary to those of many others within industry who also pay the industry charge without being members of the Federation. Nevertheless, by virtue of the 1993 Act, the [applicant] is bound by a duty to pay the charge, which, as described, is transferred to a free association with the purpose of protecting the interests of those active in Icelandic industries and those of its members, as these interests are assessed at any particular time by a decision of the managing director and the board, without any significant involvement of public authorities. When considering the above and the history of the 1993 Act, and in view of the use of the charge, without objection, for the general activities of the Federation, the arrangement provided for in the Act must be seen as involving, in fact, a duty on the part of the appellant to take a significant part in the Federation’s activities without his agreement. The above provisions of Article 74 § 2 of the Constitution, concerning people’s rights to remain outside associations, must be interpreted as prohibiting an arrangement such as provided for by the 1993 Act, unless that arrangement fulfils the requirements laid down in the second paragraph of the Article. The FII is not an association engaged in activities of the kind referred to therein. For this reason in itself, the appellant’s request for an exemption from his liability to pay the industry charge for the years 2001 to 2004 should be granted, and the respondent should be ordered to pay the appellant the costs of the case in the District Court as well as before the Supreme Court.” 20. Article 74 §§ 1 and 2 of the Icelandic Constitution provide: “Associations may be formed without prior permission for any lawful purpose, including political associations and trade unions. An association may not be dissolved by administrative decision. The activities of an association found to be in furtherance of unlawful objectives may, however, be enjoined, in which case legal action shall be brought without undue delay for a judgment dissolving the association. No one may be obliged to be a member of any association. Membership of an association may, however, be made obligatory by law if this is necessary in order to enable an association to discharge its functions in the public interest or on account of the rights of others.” 21. The relevant provisions of the 1993 Act (Law no. 134/1993) read: “A charge of 0.08%, the industry charge, shall be levied on all Icelandic industries as defined in section 2. The charge shall be based on the turnover as provided for in section 11 of the Value-Added Tax Act, plus any revenue exempted from value-added tax pursuant to section 12 of that Act. The assessment and collection of the industry charge shall be governed by the provisions of Chapters VII-XIV of the Income and Net-Worth Tax Act, as applicable. The State Treasury shall receive 0.5% of the industry charge collected in accordance with the first paragraph to cover the cost of its collection. The amounts paid under the industry charge are deductible from the revenue of the operating year on which the level of tax is based.” “Any activity coming under the activity code numbers enumerated in the appendix to this Act shall be included in the term ‘industry’. Enterprises entirely under public ownership, and enterprises formed under particular acts of law to be under public ownership to a significant extent, shall be exempt from the charge, unless a provision to the contrary is made in the Act in question.” “Revenues derived from the industry charge shall be transferred to the Federation of Icelandic Industries. The revenues shall be used to promote industry and industrial development in Iceland. The Federation shall provide an annual report to the Ministry of Industry on the use of the revenues.” “The Office of the Auditor-General may demand accounts from institutions, associations, funds and other parties that receive funding or guarantees from the State, and they shall be obliged to provide the Office of the Auditor-General with the materials requested. Furthermore, the Office of the Auditor-General shall be permitted access to, and shall have the right to examine, the original materials or reports that are created as well as invoices issued to the State or State bodies for work or services that are to be paid for, entirely or to a substantial extent, by the State Treasury in accordance with the law or contracts or labour agreements on the basis of tariffs that have been agreed with individuals or legal entities, in order to verify the contents of invoices and the payment obligation borne by the State Treasury. ... In the event of a dispute regarding the right of the Office of the Auditor-General to carry out audit work in accordance with this section, the Office of the Auditor-General may seek a ruling by the District Court.” 22. The European Committee of Social Rights has addressed the issue of trade-union fees and contributions from the angle of Article 5 of the European Social Charter on several occasions, notably those referred to below: “39. The Committee observes firstly that the fees deducted from the wages of workers pursuant to a collective agreement concluded between SBWU and the Swedish Construction Federation are, according to the collective agreement, for the service of wage monitoring. The Committee considers that the system of wage monitoring may, depending upon national traditions, be assumed either by public authorities, or, on the explicit or implicit authorisation of the legislator, by professional associations or trade unions. In the latter case this could legitimately require the payment of a fee. 40. Consequently, the Committee considers that the payment of a fee to the trade union for financing its activity of wage monitoring cannot be regarded in itself as unjustified. It also considers that it cannot be regarded as an interference with the freedom of a worker to join a trade union as the payment of the fee does not automatically lead to membership of the SBWU and in addition is not required from workers members [who are members] of trade unions other than SBWU. 41. However, the Committee considers that doubts exist as to the real use of the fees and that, in the present case, if they were to finance activities other than wage monitoring, these fees would, on the grounds indicated in paragraph 29, be deducted, at least for a part, in violation of Article 5. 42. In the present case, the Committee is not in a position to verify the use of the fees and in particular to verify to what extent the fees are proportional to the cost of the service carried out and to the benefits wage monitoring confers on the workers. These are decisive factors in determining a violation of Article 5 with reference to paragraphs 39 and 40 or 41. The Committee considers therefore that it is for the national courts to decide the matter in the light of the principles the Committee has laid down on this subject or, as the case may be, for the legislator to enable the courts to draw the consequences as regards the conformity with the [European Social] Charter and the legality of the provisions at issue. 43. The Committee reserves the right to supervise the situation in practice through the reporting procedure and, as the case may be, the collective complaints procedure. ...” “... According to the report, it is common for trade unions to impose the payment of a fee and ‘the filling [out] of an application form or of an engagement’ on non-members within the enterprise in consideration for negotiating a collective agreement. Supplementary information received from the government at the Committee’s request indicates that the basis for this practice is the single national collective agreement 2001-2002, according to which the amount of the deduction should be no less than 0.3% of salary and no more than the amount of union dues. The Committee observes that by virtue of section 9 of [Law] no. 130/1996 on collective labour agreements, collective agreements apply to all workers in the enterprise, irrespective of their length of service or trade-union membership. In these circumstances, the imposition of a fee on workers who are not members of a trade union constitutes a union security practice that is contrary to the right to organise. The Committee asks that the next report indicate clearly whether, in addition to paying a fee to the union, non-members are also required, as the report would seem to suggest, to apply for membership. ...” “... The Committee previously concluded that the situation in Romania was not in conformity with Article 5 because of the obligation on non-unionised workers to pay a fee to the trade union that had negotiated the applicable collective agreement, even though such agreements applied by law to all workers independently of whether or not they were members of a trade union (the situation is described in Conclusions 2002, p. 126). The Committee has re-examined the situation in the light of the explanations in the report and of the principles it has laid down in Complaint No. 12/2002 (Confederation of Swedish Enterprise v. Sweden, decision on the merits of 15 May 2003, §§ 26-31). It notes firstly that the contribution helps to finance an activity that benefits all employees: negotiating collective agreements. Secondly, under the single national collective agreement for 2001-2002, on which the practice is based, the contribution is not obligatory and is not earmarked for a trade union. Finally there is no statutory provision for automatic affiliation to a trade union. The Committee therefore considers that the payment of this sum cannot in itself be regarded as an infringement of employees’ right to join or not to join a trade union.” “... In its previous conclusion, the Committee asked if automatic deductions from all workers’ wages, including those who were not unionised, were forbidden under the present legislation. The report states that according to rules on deducting trade-union dues, union dues are paid only by persons who are mandated to pay such dues, which means that they must be trade-union members. Union dues can be paid in two ways. Union members may either pay their dues directly into the union account or ask their employers to deduct the dues from their wages, in which case the employer is required to comply. In 2002, parliament adopted legislation, with the support of the unions, requiring employers to deduct and transfer dues. Prior to that, deductions were only possible with the agreement of both employer and employee. The Committee considers that the procedure for deducting trade union contributions from wages at source may not be prohibited or made obligatory by national legislation. It must be made a criminal offence to use such a procedure for illegitimate purposes, for example to secure information on trade-union membership. ...” 23. Information on the right of workers and employers to establish and join organisations of their own choosing may be found in Chapter 5 of the Digest of Decisions and Principles of the Freedom of Association Committee of the Governing Body of the ILO. Under the subheading “Trade union unity and pluralism”, it is pointed out, inter alia, that the fact that workers and employers generally find it in their interest to avoid a multiplication of the number of competing organisations would not be sufficient to justify direct or indirect intervention by the State (see Digest of Decisions and Principles, 2006, paragraph 319). A monopoly situation imposed by law would be at variance with the principle of free choice of workers’ and employers’ organisations (ibid., paragraph 320). A government should neither support nor obstruct a legal attempt by a trade union to displace an existing organisation. Workers should be free to choose the union which, in their opinion, will best promote their occupational interests without interference by the authorities (ibid., paragraph 322). The imposition of an obligation on all the workers in the category concerned to pay contributions to a single national trade union, the establishment of which is permitted by branch of industry and by region, would not be compatible with the principle that workers should have the right to join organisations “of their own choosing” (ibid., paragraph 325). 24. Under the subheading “Favouritism or discrimination in respect of particular organisations”, it is stated, inter alia (references in the Digest of Decisions and Principles added after each paragraph have been omitted here): “339. Considering the limited functions which, in one case, were by law open to certain categories of trade unions, the Committee felt that the distinction made between trade unions under the national legislation could have the indirect consequence of restricting the freedom of workers to belong to the organisations of their choosing. The reasons which led the Committee to adopt this position are as follows. As a general rule, when a government can grant an advantage to one particular organisation or withdraw that advantage from one organisation in favour of another, there is a risk, even if such is not the government’s intention, that one trade union will be placed at an unfair advantage or disadvantage in relation to the others, which would thereby constitute an act of discrimination. More precisely, by placing one organisation at an advantage or at a disadvantage in relation to the others, a government may either directly or indirectly influence the choice of workers regarding the organisation to which they intend to belong, since they will undeniably want to belong to the union best able to serve them, even if their natural preference would have led them to join another organisation for occupational, religious, political or other reasons. The freedom of the parties to choose is a right expressly laid down in [ILO] Convention No. 87 [concerning freedom of association and the right to organise]. ... 340. By according favourable or unfavourable treatment to a given organisation as compared with others, a government may be able to influence the choice of workers as to the organisation which they intend to join. In addition, a government which deliberately acts in this manner violates the principle laid down in [ILO] Convention No. 87 that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict the rights provided for in the Convention or impede their lawful exercise; more indirectly, it would also violate the principle that the law of the land shall not be such as to impair, nor shall it be so applied as to impair, the guarantees provided for in the Convention. It would seem desirable that, if a government wishes to make certain facilities available to trade-union organisations, these organisations should enjoy equal treatment in this respect. ... 341. In a case in which there was at the very least a close working relationship between a trade union and the labour and other authorities, the Committee emphasised the importance it attaches to the resolution of 1952 concerning the independence of the trade-union movement and urged the government to refrain from showing favouritism towards, or discriminating against, any given trade union, and requested it to adopt a neutral attitude in its dealings with all workers’ and employers’ organisations, so that they are all placed on an equal footing. ... 342. On more than one occasion, the Committee has examined cases in which allegations were made that the public authorities had, by their attitude, favoured or discriminated against one or more trade union organisations: (1) ... (2) unequal distribution of subsidies among unions ... (3) ... Discrimination by such methods, or by others, may be an informal way of influencing the trade-union membership of workers. It is therefore sometimes difficult to prove. The fact, nevertheless, remains that any discrimination of this kind jeopardises the right of workers set out in [ILO] Convention No. 87, Article 2, to establish and join organisations of their own choosing.” 25. Chapter 8 of the Digest of Decisions and Principles contained the following principles regarding public financing and control of trade unions (references in the text added after each paragraph have been omitted here): “466. The right of workers to establish organisations of their own choosing and the right of such organisations to draw up their own constitutions and internal rules and to organise their administration and activities presuppose financial independence. Such independence implies that workers’ organisations should not be financed in such a way as to allow the public authorities to enjoy discretionary powers over them. ... 467. With regard to systems of financing the trade-union movement which made trade unions financially dependent on a public body, the Committee considered that any form of State control is incompatible with the principles of freedom of association and should be abolished since it permitted interference by the authorities in the financial management of trade unions. ... 470. A system in which workers are bound to pay contributions to a public organisation which, in turn, finances trade union organisations, constitutes a serious threat to the independence of these organisations. ... 473. Questions concerning the financing of trade union and employers’ organisations, as regards both their own budgets and those of federations and confederations, should be governed by the by-laws of the organisations, federations and confederations themselves, and therefore, constitutional or legal provisions which require contributions are incompatible with the principles of freedom of association.”",['11'],[],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant, who was born in 1911, lives in Rome. 10. On 31 January 1990 she instituted proceedings in the Rome District Court against a local health clinic in Rome for payment of an adjustment for inflation and of statutory interest in respect of arrears of her widow’s pension which had been paid six years late. 11. At the first hearing, on 9 March 1990, the court noted that the defendant had failed to appear and the judge preparing the case for trial directed that the final submissions be made on 24 March 1990. That hearing was adjourned of the court’s own motion to 24 January 1991 because the judge had been transferred. The trial before the relevant division was held on 14 October 1991. In a judgment of 24 October 1991, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 9 December 1991, the court declined jurisdiction on account of the subject-matter of the case and indicated that the Rome magistrate (pretore), sitting as an employment judge, had jurisdiction to hear it. 12. On 13 February 1992 the applicant resumed the proceedings before the Rome magistrate. At the first hearing, on 25 November 1992, the court noted that the defendant had failed to appear and the magistrate appointed an expert, who took the oath on 15 February 1993. On 23 June 1993 the magistrate withdrew to consider the case. In a judgment of the same date, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 22 July 1993, the magistrate allowed the applicant’s claim in part. 13. On 20 July 1994 the applicant appealed to the Rome District Court. On 18 October 1994 the first hearing was set down for 4 December 1996.
